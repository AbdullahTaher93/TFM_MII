Place an oven rack in position C (second position from the top) and preheat the oven to 450°F. Assemble the dough via the Biscuit Method. Combine the buttermilk and pesto before adding to the flour/fat mixture. The Biscuit Method: Scale or measure all ingredients. Chill or freeze fats. Combine the Liquids and beat well. Take the Dry Goods for a spin in the food processor for 3 to 4 pulses, then move to a large bowl. Rub Fats into the Dry Goods until about half the fat disappears and the rest is left in pea-sized pieces. Place in the freezer to keep the fat solid. Make a well in the center of the Dry Goods/Fat mixture. Pour the Wet Works into the well and quickly mix using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Stir together until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of lightly floured wax paper or parchment. Use the paper to shield your hands as you fold (not knead) the dough into a ½-inch to 1-inch thick rectangle. Then use the ends of the wax paper to fold the dough as if you were making the world’s biggest, stickiest tri-fold wallet. Repeat this three times, being as gentle as possible. Using a 2-inch pastry cutter, cut out the biscuits and place them on an ungreased baking sheet, just touching each other. Reshape the leftover dough, kneading as little as possible, and continue cutting out biscuits and adding them to the baking sheet. Bake the biscuits for 15 to 17 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove the biscuits from the oven, place into a kitchen towel-lined basket, and serve immediately.
