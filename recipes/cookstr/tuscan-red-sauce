Place a 4- or 5-quart saucepan on the stove. Break each tomato open by squeezing it with your hand over the saucepan. Once each tomato is cracked, place it in the pan. Add the sage, salt, and garlic and cover. Cook over medium heat for 45 to 60 minutes, stirring occasionally. The tomatoes will break down and liquefy as they cook. When the tomatoes are thick and saucy (about the texture of ketchup), remove from the heat. Let cool to room temperature. Process the sauce through a food mill or strainer to remove the seeds and skins, then adjust the seasonings. Whisk in the oil.
