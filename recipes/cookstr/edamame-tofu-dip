Drain the tofu and blot completely dry with paper towels/absorbent paper. Set the tofu on several thicknesses of paper while you cook the edamame. Fill a medium saucepan two-thirds full of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the edamame and ½ tsp of the salt and boil for 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water. Drain again and blot to remove excess moisture. In the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the tofu, edamame, the remaining 1½ tsp salt, the lemon juice, sesame oil, garlic, sugar, and pepper until very smooth. Scatter the minced cilantro/fresh coriander leaves over the top and pulse to incorporate. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Transfer to a serving bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld. Garnish with cilantro/fresh coriander.
