In a small bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, cloves and salt. Place confectioner’s sugar and butter in the mixer bowl. Attach the flat beater and mixer bowl to the mixer. Set to speed 4 and beat until light and fluffy. Beat in egg. Reduce speed to stir and mix in flour mixture, in 3 additions. Mix in almonds. Divide dough in half and flatten each half into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour, until firm. Working with one disk at a time, on a lightly floured work surface, roll out dough to 1/8-inch (0.25 cm) thickness. Cut out rounds with the larger cutter, then cut the centers out of half of the rounds to make rings. Re-roll the scraps and cut out more rounds and rings. Using a metal spatula, transfer rounds and rings to separate prepared baking sheets, grouping rings together and rounds together for even baking, and placing them at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Refrigerate for 1 hour, until cold. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Bake in middle of preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer to wire racks and let cool completely. Spread rounds with raspberry jam and top each with a ring. Sift confectioner’s sugar over cookies.
