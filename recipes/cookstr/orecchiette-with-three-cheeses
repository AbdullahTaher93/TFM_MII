To Make the Tomato Sauce: In a medium pan, heat the olive oil and garlic over low heat. When the garlic starts to sizzle, continue to cook it for a couple of minutes, or until it starts to change color. Do not let the garlic become brown, as that means it is burnt and will taste bitter. Add the tomatoes and their juice and continue cooking at a slow simmer over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. As the sauce starts to thicken, season with salt to taste and add the sugar (to balance the acidity of the tomatoes). To Make the Orecchiette: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). In a large pot, bring to a boil 4 quarts (3.8 L) of water. Salt the water generously, add the orecchiette, and cook to al dente, according to the package instructions. In a casserole dish, layer the orecchiette with the tomato sauce. Add the mozzarella cheese and provolone cheese and stir to combine. Sprinkle with the pecorino cheese and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese on top forms a crust.
