To prepare the fennel salt, grind the fennel seeds, salt, and peppercorns together in a spice grinder. Reserve. To prepare the vegetables, in a medium bowl, toss the fennel and onion with the olive oil and 1 teaspoon of the fennel salt. To prepare the salad, in a small bowl combine the yogurt, mustard, cayenne, and honey. Season to taste with salt. Right before serving, lightly coat the greens with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. Reserve the rest to use as a sauce for the salmon. To prepare the salmon, remove the pin bones (see Notes). Coat the salmon pieces on all sides with the remaining fennel salt and set them aside on a plate in the refrigerator. Preheat an outdoor gas grill or indoor grill pan to high heat. Oil the grill rack with vegetable oil. Grill the fennel wedges and onion slices for 6 to 8 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Grill the salmon, skin side up, until the grill marks are clearly visible. Sockeye is usually fairly thin, so a Â½-inch thick piece should cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side. This is a great dish to serve family-style on a large platter. Place the salad in the middle of the platter and top with the salmon. Scatter the vegetables all around the platter. Garnish with small fennel fronds. Serve with the reserved sauce on the side.
