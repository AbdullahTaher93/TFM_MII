To Make the Coconut Wrappers: Blend coconut meat and salt in Vita-Mix until very smooth. Add vegetable juice to color the wrappers as desired, or divide the mixture into 3 smaller batches and prepare different colors by using different juices. Spread mixture in a thin, even layer over a Teflex sheet and dehydrate for 4–5 hours. Trim the outer edges of each sheet by about 1/4–1/2 inch; cut each sheet into 9 even squares. Wrap in plastic and store in refrigerator. Remove wrappers from refrigerator and bring to room temperature prior to use. To Make the Cashew Filling: Process cashews, nama shoyu, sesame oil, tahini, and ginger in food processor until chunky consistency is achieved. Mix carrots, celery, and scallions with cashew nut meat together in a large bowl and adjust seasoning to taste. To Make the Marinated Spinach: Toss spinach with the sesame oil, ginger, salt, and chili powder. Let sit 10–15 minutes at room temperature to wilt. For Assembly : Lay Coconut Wrappers out on a cool workspace. Dab very lightly with water. Place a small amount of Marinated Spinach on each. Top with 1 tablespoon of the Cashew Filling. Pull edges up around filling to form a half-circle dumpling. Serve with Sweet Chili–Lime Sauce (see Notes).
