To marinate the salmon, lay a generous length of heavy-duty aluminum foil on a work surface. In a small bowl whisk together the lime juice and cognac. Rub both sides of each steak with the mixture. In another small bowl or ramekin, combine the sugar, salt, and pepper. Rub both sides of each steak with about 2 teaspoons of this mixture. Lay half the fresh dill in the center of the foil and place the steaks side by side on top of the dill. Lay the remaining dill on top of the steaks. Pull the foil over the salmon and seal it to form a tight package. Place the package on a rimmed baking sheet or in a shallow roasting pan. Cover the foil package with a plate or lid and put a weight on top, such as an unopened half-gallon carton of milk. Refrigerate for at least 24 and up to 48 hours. Thirty minutes before you plan to cook the salmon, pour the oil into the insert of the slow cooker and preheat it on HIGH with the cover on. Remove the salmon from the foil and discard the dill. Use a damp paper towel to gently wipe the seasonings off the fish. Place the steaks in one layer in the slow cooker. Cook on HIGH for 90 minutes, and then check the temperature of one steak with an instant-read thermometer. It should register 140Â°F when inserted in the center. (Be sure to wait 90 minutes to do this; lifting the lid allows the heat to escape, which slows the cooking process.) Serve the salmon hot with Mustard Dill Sauce or cold with an herbed mayonnaise.
