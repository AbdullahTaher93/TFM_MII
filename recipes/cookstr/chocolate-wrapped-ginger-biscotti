Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). On a sheet of waxed paper or in a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter and sugar until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. On low speed, gradually add flour mixture, beating until blended. Divide dough into halves. With a wooden spoon, stir cocoa powder and crystallized ginger into 1 portion and, using your hands, knead until thoroughly integrated. Add mini chocolate chips and ground ginger to the other portion and, using your hands, knead until thoroughly integrated. Divide each portion into halves to make 4 portions. Between two sheets of waxed paper, roll 1 portion of chocolate dough into an 8- by 6-inch (20 by 15 cm) rectangle. Remove top sheet of waxed paper. Shape 1 portion of light dough into a roll 8 inches (20 cm) long. Place roll in the center of chocolate dough and wrap chocolate dough around it. Repeat with remaining dough and place the 2 rolls about 4 inches (10 cm) apart on prepared baking sheet. Flatten slightly, leaving top slightly rounded. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until set. Cool for 15 minutes on sheet, then transfer to a cutting board. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F (160°C). Cut rolls into ½-inch (1 cm) slices. Place upright on baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until crisp and center is light golden. Cool for 5 minutes on sheet, then transfer to a rack and cool completely.
