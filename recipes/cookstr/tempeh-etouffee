Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the tempeh and brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Reheat the same skillet with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the onion, celery, bell pepper, and garlic; cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetable mixture to a 4-quart slow cooker. Stir in the tomatoes, Tabasco, salt, and water. Add the dried thyme and marjoram, if using. Cover and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours. During the final half-hour of cooking, add the browned tempeh and the fresh thyme and marjoram, if using. Stir gently to combine. Serve hot sprinkled with the parsley.
