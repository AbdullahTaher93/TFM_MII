Stir the vinegar, honey, soy sauce, sugar, and ketchup in a small pan over a low heat until the sugar is melted. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok over high heat. Add the green pepper, carrot, celery, shallots, ginger, chile, and garlic. Stir-fry until the green pepper softens, about 3 minutes. Add the shrimp and stir-fry for about 2 minutes or until they turn pink. Pour in the vinegar mixture and stir-fry for 1 minute until the shrimp and vegetables are coated and everything is heated through. Transfer to a platter and garnish with the scallions. Serve hot. Good with hot cooked rice. Variation: Sweet and Sour Fish: Substitute cubes of firm white fish, such as monkfish, for the shrimp. Strips of sole or sea bass would also work well, but take care not to overcook them, or they will disintegrate.
