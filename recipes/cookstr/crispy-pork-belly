Heavily season both sides of the pork belly with salt and pepper. Place a Dutch oven or deep ovenproof skillet over medium-low heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the oil. When the oil gets hazy, lay the pork belly in the pan and sear until the fat begin to render and crisp and the meat is brown, 10 minutes on each side. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Transfer the pork belly to a side platter and carefully pour out all but 2 tablespoons of the tendered fat. Add the onion, garlic, thyme, parsley, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Sweat the vegetables in the pork fat, stirring often, until soft, about 15 minute. Add the wine and continue to cook and stir until the liquid is reduced and looks syrupy, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat up to high, add the stock, and bring to a boil. Return the pork belly to the pan; the liquid should just barely cover the meat. Cover tightly and transfer to the oven. Braise until the pork is very tender and a fork slides into the meat without any resistance, about 2½ hours. Let the pork belly cool completely in the braising liquid. (The dish can be prepared to this point the night before and kept covered and refrigerated.) Remove the pork from the liquid and pat dry with paper towels to eliminate any excess moisture and remove any solidified fat from the surface. Pass the pork cooking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer; you should have about 5 cups. Discard the solids. Using a sharp knife, cut the pork into 4 equal portions. Generously season the pieces of pork belly with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron skillet or deep ovenproof pan over medium heat and coat with the remaining tablespoon of oil. Once hot, place the pork belly in the pan, fat side down. Sear until the fat forms a very crispy crust, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the pork over and cook the other side for another 5 minutes to brown the meat.
