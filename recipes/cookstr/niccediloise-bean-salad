Make an ice-water bath (see Notes). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add both kinds of beans, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the beans are just tender. Drain and place in the bowl of ice water for a few minutes. When the beans are cool, drain immediately and place them in a large bowl. Add the garlic, tomatoes, and vinaigrette and toss until mixed. Season with the salt and pepper.
