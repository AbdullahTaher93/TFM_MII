Season the flour with salt and pepper. Coat the crabs with the seasoned flour and shake off any excess. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for a few seconds until hot. When the oil is hot, add the butter and melt. Add the crabs to the skillet and sauté until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the crabs to dinner plates. Add the water to the skillet and increase the heat to high. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan and boil until the liquid is reduced to ¼ cup, 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and pour them over the crabs. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
