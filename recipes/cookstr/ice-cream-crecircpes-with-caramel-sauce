Prepare the crêpes. To make the almond praline: In a small, heavy skillet over medium heat, heat the sugar until it melts. Add the nuts, shake to coat, and cook until the syrup turns a light amber color. Immediately pour onto a sheet of buttered aluminum foil; let cool. Chop finely or pulverize in a blender or food processor. To make the caramel sauce: In a small, heavy saucepan over medium heat, heat the sugar until it melts and turns a light amber color. Carefully stir in the half-and-half, butter, and corn syrup. Cook and stir until smooth and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Place each crêpe on a dessert plate. Place 2 spoonfuls of the ice cream on each crêpe and fold gently to cover. Drizzle the caramel sauce over the crêpes and sprinkle with nuts. Serve at once.
