Combine the avocados, water, vanilla, and salt in a highspeed blender or a food processor. If you don’t have a highspeed blender, use the food processor here, not a conventional blender. Blend until smooth and combined, using the tamper if necessary with the high-speed blender. Add the dates and blend again until well-combined and smooth. You will need to use the tamper here with the blender. Add the cacao powder, put on the lid (so you don’t get dusted in chocolate!), and blend again until smooth. Taste for sweetness and add stevia, if desired. Serve immediately. Store leftover mousse in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Substitutions: • Dates: 1/3 cup maple syrup or coconut nectar (reducing or omitting the water) • Cacao powder: unsweetened cocoa powder or carob powder Variations: • Lower-Fat Chocolate Mousse: Use only 1½ avocados (about 1½ cups chopped flesh), add 1/3 cup plain or vanilla nondairy yogurt, and reduce the water or milk to ¼ cup. • Mexican Chocolate Mousse: Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon and a pinch of cayenne pepper. • Mocha Mousse: Use strong brewed coffee or espresso in place of the water or nondairy milk and add ¼ teaspoon coffee extract, if desired.
