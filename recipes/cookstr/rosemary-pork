. Make a brine by combining the salt, brown sugar, half the garlic, the bay leaf, and half the peppercorns with 4 cups cold water. Submerge the pork in this brine and allow to cure 4 hours. Puree the rosemary and olive oil together in a blender; stir in the remaining garlic and peppercorns. Remove the chops and discard the brine. Pat the chops dry, and rub the rosemary oil into them well. Marinate at least 30 minutes. Heat a stovetop grill, barbecue grill, or heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Grill or sauté the chops until the internal temperature reads 150°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 4 minutes per side. The meat should be slightly pink and very juicy. Set aside to rest for at least 10 minutes before cutting away the bone and slicing the chops thinly on a bias.
