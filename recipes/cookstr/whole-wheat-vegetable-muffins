Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the vegetable chunks in a food processor. Pulse on and off until the vegetables are finely minced; take care not to over process. Set aside. Combine the next 4 (dry) ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir together. Make a well in the center. Pour in the yogurt, oil, syrup, and rice milk. Stir until well combined, adding more rice milk as needed to make a smooth, slightly stiff batter. Stir in the vegetables. Divide the batter among 12 lightly oiled or paper-lined muffin tins. Top with the optional poppy seeds. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown. Remove the muffins from the tins as soon as they are cool enough to handle, and cool them on a rack or a plate. Variation: Add Â¼ cup minced dried tomato, reconstituted or oil-cured, as preferred.
