In a saucepan over medium heat, combine tamarind water and dates. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until mixture begins to thicken, 5 to 8 minutes. After mixture has thickened, mash with a spoon. Add cayenne pepper, cumin, salt and Â¾ cup (175 ml) water. Simmer for 5 minutes to allow flavors to blend. Press through large-holed strainer to make a thick, smooth sauce-like chutney. Let cool to room temperature and serve as a dipping sauce with appetizers. (Chutney can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for several months. Do not freeze.)
