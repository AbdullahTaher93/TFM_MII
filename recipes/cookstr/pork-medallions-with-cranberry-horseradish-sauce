Heat the oil in a large skillet or a stovetop grill pan or griddle over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Season the pork on both sides with salt and pepper. Add to the hot pan and cook until just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the sauce ingredients. Set the pan over medium heat, bring to a simmer, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Serve the medallions with the sauce spooned over the top.
