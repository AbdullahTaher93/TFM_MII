In a large skillet, heat beans and Â¼ cup (60 mL) reserved liquid over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and boil for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Using a potato masher, gently mash beans. Beans should be like a thick paste, not runny. If too thick, add more reserved liquid, 1 tsp (5 mL) at a time, until bean mixture is thick, but not stiff. Repeat until all beans are mashed. In another large skillet, melt lard over medium-high heat. Add mashed beans and stir until well blended and bubbly, 4 to 6 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
