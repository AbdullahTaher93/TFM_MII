To prepare the whipped cream, put the cream in a large mixing bowl. Using a whisk or an electric mixer, whip the cream until it begins to stiffen. In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon together and add to the cream. Continue whipping until soft peaks form. If not serving immediately, cover and refrigerate up to 3 hours ahead of time.
