Use a cleaver to chop the legs into 4 pieces each, whole breasts into 4 to 6 pieces. Rinse and place in a wide bowl. Set aside. Place the garlic in a mortar or a small bowl, add the salt, and mash with a pestle or the back of a wooden spoon to blend. Add both peppers and blend together. Add the flavor rub to the pieces of chicken and use your hands to rub it all over them. Set aside, covered, while you prepare your grilling arrangement (refrigerate if the wait will be longer than half an hour). Prepare a low fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to medium-hot. Place the chicken on the grill, cover, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until cooked through; turn occasionally, working quickly and replacing the lid as soon as possible to keep in the moisture and heat. Serve hot. DAI ROAST CHICKEN: This rub of mashed garlic with pepper-salt makes a wonderful coating for roast chicken. Wash and dry the chicken. Stir a tablespoon of oil into the flavor blend and then rub it all over the chicken before roasting at 400Â°F. This amount of rub will do for a small chicken (under 3 pounds); scale up in proportion if cooking a larger bird.
