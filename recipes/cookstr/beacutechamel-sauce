Heat the milk in a medium saucepan until small bubbles form around the edge. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour and stir well. Cook 2 minutes. Slowly begin adding the milk in a thin stream, stirring it in with a wire whisk. At first the sauce will become thick and lumpy, but it will gradually loosen up and become smooth as you stir in the remainder. When all of the milk has been added, stir in the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Raise the heat to medium and stir constantly until the mixture comes to a simmer. Cook 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat.
