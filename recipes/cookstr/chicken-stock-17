Place the chicken in a large stockpot. Cover with the water and bring to a boil over high heat, 25 to 30 minutes. Skim the foam from the surface and reduce the heat. Add the remaining ingredients and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours, occasionally skimming any more foam. Strain the stock and allow it to cool uncovered before refrigerating. Remove the fat from the surface when it is cold or before using. Freeze the portion not used, or reduce to form Glace de Volaille, which can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer. Two quarts of stock will reduce to yield approximately Â¾ cup glace de volaille.
