Trim the lamb of any visible fat and cut into 2-inch pieces. Put the flour onto a plate, season with salt and pepper, and roll the lamb in the flour to coat it all over. In a large skillet, heat the butter or oil, and fry the lamb in batches until nicely browned. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate and set aside. Add a little more butter to the pan if necessary, add the onion and garlic, and fry for 5 minutes until softened. Add the coriander, cumin, turmeric, ginger, chili powder, and garam masala, and cook for 3 or 4 minutes. Stir in the rest of the flour, then gradually add Â½ cup chicken stock and mix well. Add the tomatoes and, stirring continuously to deglaze the pan, bring to a boil. Simmer for 3 minutes, and transfer to the slow cooker. Add the sugar and lamb, stir, and cover. Cook on low for 5-6 hours. Just before serving, stir in the yogurt and chopped cilantro, and taste for seasoning, adjusting if necessary. Serve sprinkled with the sliced almonds.
