Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the shallots, garlic, peppercorns, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf and Sauté until the shallots and garlic are softened but not browned, about 1½ minutes. Stir in the wine. Add the mussels, cover the pot, and cook, stirring once or twice, until all the mussels are open, 2 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a colander. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Pick the mussels from their shells and save for another use.
