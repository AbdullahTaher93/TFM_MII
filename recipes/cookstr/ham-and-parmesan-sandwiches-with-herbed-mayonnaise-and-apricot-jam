Slice the bread to the desired thickness or have the bakery cut the loaf in large slices (Texas-toast sized). Lay the slices out on the work surface. In a small bowl, mix the rosemary and parsley with the mayonnaise and stir until combined. Spread the mayonnaise on one slice of each sandwich and sprinkle with pepper. Spread the apricot jam on the other slices. Put the cooked ham on the mayonnaise side and top with mustard. Put the Parmesan cheese slices on the ham slices. Top with the lettuce leaves. Put the slices with the jam on top of the other slices. Cut in half.
