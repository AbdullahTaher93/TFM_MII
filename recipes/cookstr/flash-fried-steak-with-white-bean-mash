First get on with the beans: Put the ¼ cup of olive oil in a saucepan, mince in the garlic, add the lemon zest, and warm through. Drain the beans and rinse under a tap to get rid of the gloop, then add to the pan and warm through, stirring and squishing with a wide, flat spoon so that the beans go into a nubbly mush. Add the rosemary sprig, if using, and season to taste; some beans come saltier than others. Meanwhile, heat a teaspoon of oil in a large skillet and cook the steaks on high for 1½ minutes a side. Remove to warmed plates, sprinkling some salt and pepper, to taste, over them as you do so. Squeeze the lemon juice into the hot pan and let it bubble up with the meaty oil, then pour over the steaks. Serve immediately with the mash.
