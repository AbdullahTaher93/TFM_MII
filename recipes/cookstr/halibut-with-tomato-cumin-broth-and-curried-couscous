For the tomato-cumin broth: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and sauté the onions and bell pepper until soft, 12 to 14 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tarragon, thyme, cumin, and stock, raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain through a coarse strainer, pushing down on the solids, and season with salt and pepper. For the halibut: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Season the fish with salt and pepper. In a large sauté pan, heat the oil over high heat until smoking. Add the fish flesh-side down and sear until golden, about 30 seconds. Place the pan in the oven for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the fish is nearly cooked to your preferred degree of doneness. Return the pan to the stove over high heat and add the butter. Turn the fish and cook until done, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn the fish back over and remove from the pan. (If the fish is difficult to turn, Just leave it in the oven until done, another 1 to 2 minutes.) To serve: Mound the couscous in the center of 6 serving plates and top with the fish. Spoon the broth around the couscous.
