In a large pot, blanch the marrow bone (if using) in boiling water for a few minutes. Throw out the water. Bring plenty of fresh water to the boil in the pot. Put in the bone and the meat, whole, on top. Bring to the boil again, remove the scum, and add the rest of the ingredients, also whole. Barely simmer for at least 3Â½ hours, keeping the meat covered with water. Remove as much of the fat as possible from the surface with a spoon, and mop up what is left by trailing a rolled-up paper towel over the surface.
