Chop the cilantro. Mince the onion. Cut the fish into small pieces. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, fish, chili powder, and garlic salt. Stir the ingredients with a wooden spoon. As the fish begins to cook, use the spoon to break it into flakes. Lay each tortilla on a sheet of foil (make the sheets a few inches wider than the tortillas). On top of each tortilla, place 2 tablespoons fish, 1 tablespoon black beans, 2 tablespoons cheese, and 1 teaspoon cilantro. Roll up the burritos and seal with foil. Place the foil-wrapped burritos directly on the rack of a preheated 350Â°F oven for 20 minutes or until heated through. Serve immediately.
