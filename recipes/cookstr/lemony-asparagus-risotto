In a stockpot, combine the broth and the wine. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to medium-low to keep the liquid at a simmer. In a wok over medium heat, melt the butter and add the olive oil. Sauté the shallots until golden, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and stir, gently “toasting” it for 2 minutes. Add the asparagus and 1½ cups of the simmering liquid. Cook, stirring, until the liquid is almost completely absorbed by the rice. Add the remaining liquid a ladleful at a time and continue stirring until the rice is cooked through and tender and the liquid is completely absorbed, about 35 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan, mascarpone, and lemon zest and juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve
