Generously butter twelve 4-ounce (1/2-cup) ramekins or soufflé dishes. Set aside. Stir the cornmeal into the milk in a saucepan. Heat the mixture, stirring constantly, until it just barely comes to a boil and starts to thicken. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the egg yolks, corn, chili powder, salt and chilies, mixing thoroughly. Add the bacon and grated cheese. Stir well, until thoroughly incorporated. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Beat the egg white in a large bowl until stiff but not dry. Stir about one-quarter of the white very thoroughly into the corn mixture. Add the remaining white and stir and fold until no white shows. Divide the mixture evenly among the twelve ramekins. Top each with a slice of cheese. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until set.
