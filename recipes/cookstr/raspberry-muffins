Preheat the oven to 400°F. Melt the butter in a saucepan and cook until it is very light golden in color. Mix together the ground almonds, lemon rind, confectioners’ sugar, cornmeal and cornstarch in a large bowl and pour in the melted butter. Gently mix together and fold in the lightly beaten egg whites. Pour the mixture into the paper cases (or use 24 petitfour cases to make mini ones) and dot with raspberries. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes until golden and springy to touch. Cool on wire racks and sprinkle with extra gluten-free confectioners’ sugar, if you wish, before serving.
