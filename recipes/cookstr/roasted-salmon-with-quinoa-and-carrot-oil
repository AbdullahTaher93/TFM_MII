For the quinoa: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet in 1 layer and toast until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Chop medium-coarse and reserve. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat until almost smoking and sauté the onion for 1 minute. Add the carrots and the mushrooms and sauté 1 minute. Add the quinoa and Sauté 1 minute. Add the chicken stock, raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes, adding extra stock if it dries out. Transfer to a strainer if there is excess liquid, then return to the pot, season with salt and pepper, and stir in the nuts and parsley. Reserve, keeping warm. For the salmon: If you are going to finish the salmon in the oven, preheat to 400°F. Season the salmon with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the salmon flesh-side down and sear 3 to 4 minutes, add the butter, turn over the fish, and cook another 3 to 4 minutes on the other side. Or sear flesh-side down, then place in the preheated oven until medium rare, about 5 minutes. Then add butter and sear the other side until brown. Remove from the pan. To serve: Mound about ½ cup of quinoa in the center of each warm serving plate. Place a portion of salmon on top of the quinoa and drizzle the carrot oil around the salmon. Good, chewy substitutes for quinoa: Wild Rice with Pine Nuts or Curried Couscous Substitutes for carrot oil: Basil Oil, Curry Oil--especially nice if you substitute curried couscous--Beet Oil, or Roasted Garlic-Black Olive Oil For the fish, substitute boneless, skinless chicken breasts.
