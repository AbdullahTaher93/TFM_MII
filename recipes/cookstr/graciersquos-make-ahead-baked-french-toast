In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the eggs, cream, milk, honey, vanilla, and nutmeg. Process until smooth. Alternatively, mix this by hand with a wire whisk. Arrange the bread slices in a snug layer in a shallow, freezer-safe dish just large enough to hold them. Pour the batter over the bread and let it sit a few minutes to soak in. Gently turn the slices over and let them soak up the rest of the batter. Put the dish in the freezer, uncovered, for at least 4 hours or overnight, until frozen. (Once it is frozen, the bread slices can be packed in an airtight container or plastic freezer bag for up to 2 weeks.) Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly butter a baking sheet. Put the frozen bread on the baking sheet. Brush each slice on one side with half the melted butter. Bake for about 10 to 15 minutes, then turn over and cook for another 15 minutes. Turn the bread slices over and brush with the remaining butter. Bake for about 8 minutes longer, or until nicely browned. Serve the French toast immediately with warm maple syrup on the side.
