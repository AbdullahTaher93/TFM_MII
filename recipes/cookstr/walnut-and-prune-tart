Preheat the oven to 350°. In a heavy saucepan, combine the cream, honey, sugar, and butter over high heat. Place the thermometer in the mixture and bring to a boil. Continue to boil until the thermometer registers 215°. Fold in the walnuts and prunes and mix thoroughly. Pour in the mixture into the prebaked pie shell. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the mixture is bubbly and the nuts are glazed and golden brown. Cool on a rack for 30 minutes before serving. Serve in small wedges with unsweetened whipped cream.
