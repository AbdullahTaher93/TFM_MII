In a large saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch and salt. Whisk in coconut milk until smooth. Whisk in egg yolks until smooth. Whisk in milk. Cook mixture over medium heat, whisking continuously, until thick and bubbly. Reduce temperature to low and continue to cook, whisking, for 2 minutes more or until mixture is very thick. Remove saucepan from heat and strain filling through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Stir in coconut and butter until butter is melted. Pour into prepared pie crust, pressing a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool completely. Refrigerate pie for 4 to 6 hours or until filling is firm enough to slice. Topping: Just prior to serving pie, in a bowl, using an electric mixer or whisk, whip together cream and confectionerâ€™s sugar until soft peaks form. Swirl whipped cream over top of pie and garnish with toasted coconut.
