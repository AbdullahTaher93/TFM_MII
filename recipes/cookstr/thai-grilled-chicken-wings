Marinate wings for at least 2 hours in a mixture of curry paste, 1 tbsp (15 ml) fish sauce, 1 tbsp (15 ml) lime juice, sugar, coriander, ginger, lime leaf (if available), and oil. In a small saucepan over very low heat, stir in the honey, 1 tbsp (15 ml) fish sauce, remaining 2 tbsp (25 ml) lime juice and garlic until it reaches a simmer and is well mixed; set aside. Thread each wing onto a skewer, starting at the tip of the drumette through the 3 sections so the wing tip is at the tip of the skewer and the wing is stretched straight. Grill over hot charcoal or under a broiler until cooked through and nicely browned; brush with the garlic glaze, turning each wing 2 or 3 times and glazing each time. On the last turn, sprinkle with the chopped chilies to taste (they should stick to the glaze). Serve garnished with lime wedges.
