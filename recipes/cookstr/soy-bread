Place the yeast, water, milk powder, oil, honey, and salt in a dishpan or large bowl and stir with a wooden spoon. Add the white flour and soy flour and continue to stir. Add 4 cups of whole wheat flour and mix with the spoon until well blended. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough, which will be very sticky, and knead it just long enough to mix thoroughly (you won’t be able to do much more than that). Shape it into a very soft, sticky ball. Spread a little oil on the bottom and sides of another large bowl. Add the ball of dough, then turn it over, oiled side up. Cover and set in a warm spot for about 45 minutes, or until the dough doubles in bulk. Thoroughly grease (with oil or butter) two 8-x-4-inch bread pans, and sprinkle the bottoms with a little cornmeal. Set aside. Punch down the risen dough (it will be much more manageable at this point). Add enough flour to make it easy to knead, then knead for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the dough feels smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Cut the ball of dough in half, then pat each half into a flattened rectangle that is a little longer than the pans. Starting at one of the long sides, tightly roll up each rectangle. Pinch the seam together, turn the loaf over, and tuck the ends under neatly. Place seam-side down in the prepared pans, cover, and let rise for about 30 minutes, or until doubled in bulk. Place in a preheated 375°F oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the loaves are very brown and hollow-sounding when rapped on the bottom with your knuckle. Cool on a wire rack before serving.
