In a small pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil, add the garlic and ginger, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add sugar, water, chili garlic sauce, vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Return to the heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes until the sauce takes on a syrup-like consistency. Set aside and keep warm. Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a wok or heavy-based skillet and cook the tofu until golden brown on all sides. Remove the tofu from the pan and keep warm. Stir-fry the asparagus until it is almost tender-crisp, add the red bell pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the spinach and stir-fry until just wilted. Return the tofu to the pan, add the cashews, and stir to mix. Pour the sweet and spicy sauce over the pan and serve immediately on a bed of rice.
