In a small saucepan, heat 3 cups (750 ml) dashi just to a simmer. In a small bowl, dissolve the miso in 1 to 2 tablespoons of the hot dashi and return to the pan. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, bring the remaining dashi to a boil. Stir in the broccoli di rape. Bring to a simmer and cook until the rape turns bright green, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tofu and simmer for 1 minute. Turn the tofu pieces over and simmer for 1 minute. Stir in the miso broth. Heat until little bubbles form around the sides. Divide the vegetables and broth evenly among four small bowls. Top each bowl with a few pieces of the lemon zest.
