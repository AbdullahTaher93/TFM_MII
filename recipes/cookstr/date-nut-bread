Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease an 8½ × 4½ × 3-inch loaf pan. Put the dates, walnuts, baking soda, salt, and shortening in a bowl. Pour the boiling water over and stir. Let the mixture stand for 15 minutes. Using a fork, beat the eggs and sugar together in a bowl. Add the flours and stir (this will be too stiff to mix well). Add the date mixture and mix briskly until the batter is well blended. Spoon into the loaf pan and bake for about 1 hour, or until a straw comes out clean when inserted into the center. Remove and cool on a rack. Variations: Fig Nut Bread: Substitute 1 cup chopped figs for the dates. Proceed as directed above. Prune Bread: Omit the dates and walnuts. Substitute 1½ cups pitted, chopped prunes. Proceed as directed above.
