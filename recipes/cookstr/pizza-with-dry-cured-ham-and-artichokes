Set the rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F. Dab some olive oil on a wadded-up paper towel and use it to grease a large baking sheet, Lay the fresh dough on the sheet; dimple the dough with your fingertips as you begin to press it out into a rectangular shape to fit the baking sheet. Continue stretching and pulling the dough until it’s a rough 6½-by-10-inch rectangle. If you’re working with a prebaked crust, you can skip this step entirely-just set it right on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle the grated mozzarella evenly over the dough, leaving a ½-inch border around the perimeter. Top with the diced tomato and the basil. Slice the artichoke hearts into halves the long way and sprinkle these over the pie, Top with ham; then sprinkle the Parrnigiano-Reggiano, oregano, and red pepper flakes over the other toppings. Set the pie on its baking sheet in the oven and bake until the cheese has melted and the crust is firm to the touch, about 18 minutes. Transfer the pie on its baking sheet to a wire rack and cool for 5 to 10 minutes before you slice it into squares or wedges.
