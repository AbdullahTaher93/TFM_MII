Carefully place the goat cheese slices in a clean 1-pint (500ml) glass jar. Arrange the garlic cloves, peppercorns, herbs, and chiles around the cheese. Pour in enough olive oil to completely cover all the ingredients. Close the jar. Store at room temperature for a few hours, then refrigerate overnight. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving.
