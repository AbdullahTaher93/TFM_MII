Pour the olive oil into a blender jar or the workbowl of a food processor and add everything else but the cheese. Blend until smooth, scraping down the jar if necessary. Transfer the pesto to a bowl and stir in the cheese. The pesto will keep a couple of days in the refrigerator or several months in the freezer. If you’re planning to freeze it, leave out the garlic and cheese; add them after it’s defrosted.
