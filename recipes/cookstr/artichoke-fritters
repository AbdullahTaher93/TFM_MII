For the Dipping Sauce: Mix all the ingredients in a small bowl. Use a small dollop on each fritter. Yield: 1 cup For the Fritters: Pour 3 inches of vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed pot and place over medium heat until a bread cube placed in the oil browns within 1 minute. Coarsely chop the artichokes and put them in a large mixing bowl. Add the garlic and green onions, milk, egg, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl and quickly stir the dry ingredients into the artichoke mix. Drop the fritters by heaping teaspoonful into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.
