Heat a heavy stockpot or saucepan over medium-high heat, add the oil, and when hot, add the onion and mustard seeds and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, and chiles and continue to sauté for an additional 2 minutes. Stir in the coriander, cumin, and turmeric and heat for an additional minute. Add the broth, lentils, and potato to the stockpot and heat to just below boiling. Simmer the soup for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the lentils and potatoes are very soft. Put the soup in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Strain the soup back into the pot and reheat. Ladle the soup into individual bowls, garnish with cilantro or parsley, and serve.
