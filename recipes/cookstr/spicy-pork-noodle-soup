Remove and discard the fat from the pork. Slice the pork into ¼-inch matchstick strips. In a medium bowl, mix the salt, pepper, and cornstarch and toss with the pork. Marinate the pork for 20 minutes. Soak the dried rice noodles in warm tap water for 15 minutes; drain. Rinse well with cold water and drain well. Set aside. Cut the chili pepper into thin matchstick strips. Cut the green onions into 1½-inch matchstick strips. Heat a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Add the chili paste, garlic, and chili pepper and sauté for 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add the pork and rice noodles; stir to separate the pork pieces. Return to boiling again and turn off the heat. Add the green onions.
