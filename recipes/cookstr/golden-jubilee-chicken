Tumble the mango cubes, and any juice they make, into a bowl and, with your hands, mix in the chopped scallion and chilli and squeeze over the lime juice: use as much or as little as you want; frankly, the amount of juice you can get from a lime varies enormously from one to another. I tend to leave all these to steep while I get on with the rest of my shredding and chopping, but whatever way you do it, tumble in the chunked chicken and shredded lettuce and most of the cilantro and, using your hands, toss to combine. Add the oils and toss again then decant onto a large serving plate and sprinkle over the remaining bit of cilantro.
