Combine the salt, rosemary, pepper, coriander, chile powder, and sage in a small bowl. Sprinkle the rub on both sides of the meat. In a heavy Dutch oven or a heavy, deep skillet, heat the oil over high heat. When hot, add the meat and brown well on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Place the meat in the slow cooker. (If you are using a round slow cooker, you may have to cut the meat in half and stack the pieces.) Add the water, then the bay leaf and garlic. Cover and cook on HIGH for about 5 hours, turning the meat once about halfway through cooking, if desired or possible, to coat both sides evenly with the cooking liquid. Add the barbecue sauce, cover, and cook on HIGH until the meat is fork tender, another 1 to 1Â½ hours. Slice and serve with the extra sauce on the side.
