Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 12-cup standard muffin tin with butter. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugar on medium-high speed. Add the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to medium-low. Add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with the milk. Fold in the jam in three or four strokes, until just incorporated. Divide the batter among the cups of the prepared tin. Bake until golden on top and a cake tester inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool for 5 minutes in the pan. While the cakes cool, prepare the glaze: Whisk together the sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Turn the cakes onto a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of each cake generously with the glaze. Turn the cakes over and brush the bottoms with the glaze. Let cool completely.
