To make the marinade, combine all the ingredients for the marinade in a wok over medium heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Let the marinade cool, then pour it into a resealable plastic bag. Put the cod fillets in the bag and seal it. Refrigerate, turning the bag over once before you head off to bed. To steam the fish, remove it from the pouch and discard the marinade. Pour a few inches of water into the bottom of a wok and set a rack or bamboo steamer over the water. Cover the wok and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Put the fish on the rack and steam until it is opaque and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Monitor the level of water in the wok, adding more as needed to ensure that it doesn’t go dry. You’ll know the fish is done when it flakes with little resistance. To serve, arrange the fish on a bed of steamed rice and drizzle with the sesame oil.
