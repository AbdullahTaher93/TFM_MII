1 Prepare the marinade by combining the first eight ingredients. 2 Separate the bok choy leaves and cut the stems into 1-inch sections. Marinate with the tofu, mushrooms, and onion for up to 1 hour, depending upon how strong a flavor you want. 3 Thread the ingredients (youâ€™ll need to roll the bok choy leaves)onto four large (or twelve small) thick wooden skewers, and cook on a barbecue or under a broiler for 7-10 minutes, basting with the marinade and turning regularly.
