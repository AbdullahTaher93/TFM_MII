Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Wash and dry the fish with paper towels. Salt and pepper trout. In two ovenproof skillets, melt the butter and set one trout in each pan, stomach-side down, curling the fish to fit the pan. Baste with butter and cook for 5 minutes over moderate heat. Baste the trout again and place in oven to cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until moist and tender. Place on a heated platter with the pilaf and beans.
