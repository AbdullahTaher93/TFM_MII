1 Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a roasting pan with foil and lightly oil it. 2 Cut the tempeh in half lengthwise, then crosswise into short, ½-inch-thick strips. 3 Stir all the ingredients together in a mixing bowl, then transfer to the prepared pan. 4 Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the vegetables are just tender, stirring after the first 10 minutes, then serve.
