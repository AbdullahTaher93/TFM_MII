Heat the oil to 375 degrees. Over a large mixing bowl, sift to combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Make a large well in the center and pour in the eggs, buttermilk, honey, almond extract, and orange flower water. Whisk together the liquid ingredients and slowly draw in the dry ingredients. The mixture should be fairly smooth before you draw in more flour. Fill the pastry bag half full and pipe the batter directly into the hot oil, making random, 3-inch-long squiggles. After youâ€™ve piped a few, wait until they have risen back to the surface before you pipe more, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Pile onto a platter and sift nonmelting icing sugar or powdered sugar over the top.
