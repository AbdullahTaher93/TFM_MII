Make the fish stock: In a large stockpot, combine all the ingredients. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes, partially covered. Skim any impurities that rise to the top several times during cooking. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve. (You should have approximately 3 quarts.) Prepare the cod and vegetables: Put the fish stock in a large stockpot and bring it to a boil. Add the fennel wedges, carrots, and potatoes, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the stock with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl. Bring the stock back to a high simmer and add the cod pieces. Poach for 8 to 10 minutes until the cod is flaky and opaque. Return the vegetables to the pot and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. To serve, place 6 large soup bowls on the counter near the stove. Place a variety of vegetables in each bowl, Then place a piece of cod in the center of each bowl along with the vegetables. Ladle some of the hot broth over the fish and vegetables. Sprinkle with sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Chop 1 tablespoon of fennel fronds and garnish each bowl with some chopped fennel fronds. Serve immediately.
