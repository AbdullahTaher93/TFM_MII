Bring to a simmer over moderate heat and poach until the peaches can be pierced easily with a sharp knife, 10 to 15 minutes. Discard the lemons. Let the peaches cool in their liquid, and serve at room temperature. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat and poach until the peaches can be pierced easily with a sharp knife, 10 to 15 minutes.
