Serves 4 Put the chicken in a deep bowl. Place the chile powder, lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl, and stir well. Rub this paste onto the chicken cubes so that they are evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to marinate. Make the marinade: Put the yogurt in a bowl. Stir in the chile powder, salt, ginger paste, garlic paste, lemon juice, garam masala, and mustard oil. Whisk until smooth. Rub the yogurt mixture into the chicken so that all the cubes are well coated. Cover the bowl and put it in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 hours to marinate. Meanwhile, soak some wooden skewers in water. Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C. Thread the chicken cubes onto skewers. Arrange in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 10 to 2 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. You can also cook them in a moderately hot tandoor for 10 to 12 minutes. Baste with the butter and cook for 2 minutes more. Sprinkle with chaat masala and serve with onion rings and lemon wedges.
