If using dried beans, quick-cook them: Place the beans in a large pot with water to cover by 3 inches and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered 45 minutes. Remove from the heat, drain, rinse, and set aside. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add the onion and cook about 15 minutes, stirring constantly, until the onion has softened. Add the bell pepper, jalapeño, and garlic and cook about 5 minutes more, stirring constantly. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, and basil and cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the broth, tomatoes, beer, Worcestershire sauce, chicken, beans (if using canned beans, see note in step 5), and cornmeal and stir to mix well. Add the salt and pepper, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 1½ hours, uncovered, until the beans are tender and the flavors have developed. (Note: If using canned beans, add them at this point and cook about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.) Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro and scallions. Variations: Turkey can be substituted for the chicken. Or use leftover beef or pork or a combination of the two. Make this a “green chili” by using chopped tomatillos (fresh or canned) instead of chopped tomatoes. Any kind of bean can be used; at Foster’s, we often make this with pinto, kidney, or lima beans. Roasted jalapeños or chipotles (for a smoky flavor) can be used instead of fresh jalapeños.
