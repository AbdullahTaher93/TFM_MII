Bring the pit to a steady temperature between 180°F to 220°F. Prick the potatoes well in several spots, and rub a light film of vegetable oil over them. Place the potatoes in the pit, and cook them until they are soft, about 2 hours. The potatoes can sit for 15 minutes before serving, or up to an hour if you wrap them in foil. While the potatoes cook, prepare the Honey-Mint Butter: Melt the butter and honey together in a small pan. Add the mint, and then the salt and pepper. Rewarm the butter, if necessary, just before eating. To serve the sweet potatoes, slit open the top of each one and drizzle with the Honey-Mint Butter.
