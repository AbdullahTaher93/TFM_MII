Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C, or gas mark 6). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. To make the bacon: Place the tempeh slices in a shallow dish. Combine the soy sauce, liquid smoke, mustard, oil, onion, paprika, chile powder, garlic, and brown sugar in a small bowl. Pour on top of the tempeh slices, carefully brushing it allover on both sides. Spread on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly coat the top of the tempeh with cooking spray. Bake for 10 minutes, flip over, lightly coat with spray again, and bake for 10 minutes longer, or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack. (The bacon is at its crispiest right out of the oven.) To assemble the sandwiches: Combine the mayonnaise and pesto in a small bowl. Apply 1 tablespoon (15 g) on every slice of bread. Place 4 slices of bacon on 4 slices of bread. Top each sandwich with half a roasted red pepper, 1 scant cup (28 g) spinach or (19 g) arugula, and the remaining slice of bread.
