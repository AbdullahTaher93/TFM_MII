Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for cooking the pasta. Peel and dice the tomatoes; set aside. In a heavy, seasoned skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the onion, not stirring for a minute or two, until the edges brown a bit, then stir and add the tomatoes. Add the garlic, chiles, and oregano. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain and add to the tomato mixture. Stir together and serve.
