Marinade: In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, oregano, and paprika. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place pork in a large resealable plastic bag. Add marinade. Seal and massage marinade into pork. Set aside. Place potatoes in a large saucepan and add boiling water to barely cover. Add salt, cover loosely and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and parboil for 10 minutes or until potatoes are just tender. Drain well and rinse under cold running water until cooled (make sure potatoes are well cooled before proceeding). Using the tines of a fork, pierce each potato a few times, then transfer to bag with pork. Seal bag and turn and massage to coat pork and potatoes with marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or preferably longer, for up to 12 hours. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Lightly oil grill and preheat to high. Set a colander over a bowl and pour pork mixture into colander, collecting marinade in bowl. Evenly divide pork and potatoes among six skewers. In a small saucepan, bring marinade to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. Reduce grill heat to medium and grill skewers, turning to brown all over and basting with marinade, for 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender and pork is just barely pink in the center. Remove from grill and serve immediately with fresh lemon wedges.
