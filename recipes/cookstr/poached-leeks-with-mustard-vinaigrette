Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and place under cold running water to clean out any grit from the folds. In a large, shallow skillet bring enough salted water to cover the leeks to a boil. Add the leeks, cut side down, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover, and poach the leeks for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with a fork. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the leeks to a kitchen towel to drain, cut side down. TO MAKE THE VINAIGRETTE: In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, and mustard until they start to emulsify. Slowly pour in the olive oil, whisking until the mixture becomes creamy. TO ASSEMBLE: In a small bowl, toss the egg with the parsley. Arrange the leeks on a small platter or on individual plates with the white tips facing one direction. Drizzle the vinaigrette over the leeks and scatter the parsley and egg mixture over the white tips. Place a sliver of anchovy over the chopped egg and parsley mixture.
