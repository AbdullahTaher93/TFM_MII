1 Combine all curry paste ingredients except the peanuts in a blender. Process until smooth. Stir in the ground peanuts, blend one more time, and set aside. 2 Scoop 1 cup (250 ml) of the coconut cream into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Stir in the curry paste and reduce the heat to medium-low; cook until the mixture is fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. 3 Add the beef to the saucepan and stir until well mixed. Add the remaining 1Â½ cups (375 ml) coconut cream. Cook for about 5 minutes more, or until the meat loses its pink color. Add the Thai basil leaves, the kaffir lime leaves, chilies (if using), fish sauce, and sugar. Stir until well combined. Serve hot.
