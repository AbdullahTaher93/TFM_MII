Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt the butter in a medium frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the leeks, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until tender. Cool. Mix the cream cheese, Parmesan, cream, chives, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Stir into the leeks and season with salt and pepper. On a lightly floured work surface, roll 1 pastry sheet into a 12 × 9 in (30 × 20cm) rectangle, then trim 1 in (2.5cm) from the short side. Place on the lined baking sheet. Spread the filling over the pasty, leaving a ¾ in (2cm) border. Brush the border with the beaten yolk. Roll and trim the remaining pastry to the same size. Center over the filling, and seal the edges with a fork. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Brush the top with the egg yolk. Using the tip of a knife, pierce a few slits in the center of the tart. Score the top in a criss-cross pattern. Bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool for 10 minutes, then slice and serve.
