Place the New Mexican and ancho chiles in a bowl and cover them with very hot water. Allow them to steep for 15 minutes to soften. Drain the chiles and discard the water. Place the chiles in a blender or food processor along with some water, and puree them until smooth. Strain the mixture to remove any remaining pieces of chile skins. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, add the meat, and saut√© until browned. Drain off any excess fat. If using the cubed meat, add a little vegetable oil to the skillet and then brown the meat. Add the onions and garlic to the skillet and continue cooking until the onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large saucepan or stockpot. Heat the pan over medium heat, crumble the chiles over the mixture, and add the oregano, cumin, sugar, broth, and tomato sauce. Simmer the chili for 45 minutes. Stir in the chile puree, season with salt and pepper, and continue to simmer for an additional 30 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings. To serve, ladle the chili into bowls and serve the beans on the side.
