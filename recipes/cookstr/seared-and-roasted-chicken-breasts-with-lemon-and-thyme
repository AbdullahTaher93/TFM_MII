For the chicken: Combine the lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a small bowl. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow pan and pour the lemon mixture over them, coating both sides. Scatter the zest, thyme, and pepper over both sides. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 1 day. Preheat the oven for 400°F. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil until smoking over high heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, then immediately transfer the pan to the oven and roast the chicken for 8 minutes. Turn and continue roasting until just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the pan and let rest at room temperature for 5 minutes, keeping warm. For the sauce: Pour off any grease and return the skillet to medium heat. Heat the olive oil until shimmering, then sauté the shallot for 1 minute. Add the stock and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up any browned bits. Add the lemon juice and thyme, reduce the heat to medium-high, and boil gently until reduced by a little mote than half. Reduce the heat to medium and whisk in the butter. Taste and add more lemon juice if needed. Season with salt and pepper. To serve: Cut each breast on the bias into ½-inch slices. Place on a warm serving plate and spoon the sauce on top, to taste.
