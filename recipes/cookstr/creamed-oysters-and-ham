In a small saucepan, reduce the 1 cup of oyster liquor by half over moderate heat. In a medium saucepan, combine the reduced cream with the cayenne. Strain the reduced liquor into the cream. Set aside and keep warm while you make the Buckwheat Cakes. To serve, fold the oysters into the warm cream mixture and cook over moderate heat just until the edges begin to curl. Stir in the ham. Keep warm.
