Put the tomate verde and chiles into a pan, cover with water, and bring to a simmer; continue cooking until the tornate verde is soft but not falling apart-about 10 minutes, depending on size. Remove from heat. Strain, reserving 1/3 cup (85 ml) of the cooking water. Put the reserved cooking water into a blender jar, add the chiles, cilantro, and garlic, and blend until almost smooth. Add the tornate verde and blend for 10 seconds, no more, to make a fairly smooth sauce. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the sauce and reduce over high heat until it thickens and seasonsâ€”about 8 minutes. Add salt to taste.
