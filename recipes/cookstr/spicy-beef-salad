Pat the meat dry with a paper towel. Combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon fish sauce, sugar, and black pepper in a deep plate and add the meat, turning to coat both sides of the steak. Set aside to marinate for a couple of minutes. Heat a little oil in a large skillet over high heat. Sear the meat for 2 minutes on each side, then return it to the marinade (set the skillet aside). Let rest for 2 to 4 minutes, turning twice. Set the skillet over medium heat, add the steak, and cook for 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the tomatoes, scallions, onion, cucumber, and mild chiles. Crush the green peppercorns gently with the side of a knife. In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, 2 teaspoons fish sauce, sugar, bird’s-eye chiles, and green peppercorns. Cut the meal diagonally across the grain into ¼-inch slices. Add to the salad. Add the dressing and toss well. Sprinkle with the crispy dried onions (if desired) and serve immediately.
