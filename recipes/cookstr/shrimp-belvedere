In a 10-cup casserole dish over high heat, combine the potatoes and water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium, and cook for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and the water almost gone. Stir in the butter and cook for 3 more minutes, then stir in the rest of the ingredients, cover, raise the heat to high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are just pink, about 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaves and serve immediately.
