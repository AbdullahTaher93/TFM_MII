Orange glaze: cook orange juice in a saucepan over a medium heat for about 10 minutes until it is reduced by half and there is about a cup of glaze. Set aside. Sprinkle the chops with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 2 or 3 minutes. Add the chops (youâ€™ll probably have to cook them in batches, and it is important not to overcrowd the pan) and turn the heat to high. Cook the chops for 3 to 4 minutes on each side until they are brown. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the wine and garlic and cook until the wine is almost evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add the orange glaze and sliced oranges, and reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, turning once or twice until the chops are tender but not dry. Remove the chops to a serving platter. Continue cooking the pan juices, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the liquid is reduced slightly. If you need to add more liquid, add a bit more orange juice combined with water or chicken stock. Pour over the chops, top with the orange zest, and serve.
