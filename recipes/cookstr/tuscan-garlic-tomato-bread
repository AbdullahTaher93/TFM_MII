Cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze to remove seeds and juice. Toast or grill the bread until lightly browned. Rub one side of each bread slice with a half clove of garlic. Then roughly rub a deseeded tomato half over the same side of the bread until the bread begins to take on the color and the essence of the tomato. Repeat procedure with remaining bread, garlic and tomato. Place bread on a serving platter. Drizzle with the olive oil and season each slice with salt and pepper.
