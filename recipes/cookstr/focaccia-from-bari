In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt and mix well. Slowly add the water and mix with your hands, breaking up any lumps. When the dough is smooth (it should be almost runny), cover it with a towel, wrap the bowl in a warm blanket, and let the dough rise in a warm spot for at least 1½ hours. The dough should double in size and have bubbles at the end of the rising. If you want a thicker focaccia, let the dough rise for an additional ½ hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Generously brush the bottom and sides of a large baking pan with olive oil, leaving no dry spots. Spoon the focaccia dough into the pan and spread evenly. Spread the canned tomatoes on the surface of the dough and sprinkle with oregano and capers (and olives, if desired). Sprinkle with sea salt and drizzle with a little olive oil. Bake for 45 minutes.
