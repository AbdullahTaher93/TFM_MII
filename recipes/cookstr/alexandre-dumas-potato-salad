Boil the potatoes in their skins in salted water to cover until just pierceable. Drain and peel while hot. Slice them into a bowl, season to taste with salt and pepper, and pour the wine and oil over them. Let them cool, then add the vinegar, parsley, and green onions or chives, and toss lightly. Serve with cold meats or chicken, or as part of a summer buffet.
