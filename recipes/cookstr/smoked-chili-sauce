In a deep saucepan over medium heat, combine rice vinegar, cider vinegar, cloves and allspice. Bring to a low boil. Set aside. In work bowl fitted with metal blade, process onion, garlic, brown sugar, ketchup, chipotle peppers, cilantro and Worcestershire sauce until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Add to cider mixture and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and boil gently, stirring often, until reduced to a thick sauce, about 1 hour. Let cool. Variation: Omit the chipotle peppers for a basic chili sauce.
