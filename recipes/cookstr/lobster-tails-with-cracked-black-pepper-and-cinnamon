Cut the lobster tails in half lengthwise, through the shell, using either kitchen shears or a cleaver. (The meat will remain in the shells as you poach them, making for an attractive presentation.) Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks, and stir-fry until the onion is partially browned and smells aromatic, about 3 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk and add the pepper, salt, curry leaves, and ginger. Stir once or twice to incorporate the flavors. Place the four lobster halves, meat side up, in a single layer in the pan. Anoint the tails with the creamy sauce. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and poach, basting the tails occasionally, until the meat is white and firm and the tails curl up slightly (akin to shrimp), 7 to 9 minutes. Lift the tails onto a serving platter, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil to keep warm. Raise the heat under the pan to medium-high and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the sauce over the lobster tails, and serve immediately.
