Line a fine-mesh strainer with a double thickness of cheesecloth that has been rinsed and squeezed dry. Pour the yogurt into the strainer and place the strainer over a bowl to catch the liquid. (Make sure that the bottom of the strainer is high enough so that the liquid wonâ€™t reach the strainer as it drains.) Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, discarding the liquid. Mix the grated cucumber, salt, and garlic and place in a strainer over a bowl to catch the juice. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Discard the juice. In a large bowl, combine the drained yogurt, sour cream, lemon juice, cilantro, and pepper. Squeeze the cucumber dry and add to the yogurt. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if desired. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours.
