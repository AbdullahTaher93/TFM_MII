Crumble the rice with your fingers to break up any big lumps, and place a serving platter and a table knife by the stove. Heat a large, deep skillet or a wok over medium-high heat. Add about 2 teaspoons of the oil and swirl to coat the pan lightly. Add the beaten egg and tilt the pan to make a thin egg pancake. Cook until set, about 1 minute, and then turn it out onto the serving platter. Add the remaining oil to the pan, along with the garlic and onion, and cook until sizzling and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Scatter the shrimp in the pan and cook, tossing once or twice, until they are pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the rice and cook, tossing now and then, until shiny and heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, roll up the egg pancake into a cylinder, cut it crosswise into thin ribbons with the table knife, and keep them handy on the platter near the stove. Add the fish sauce, salt, pepper, and green onion to the rice and toss. Add the egg ribbons, and cook, tossing well, for 1 more minute. Mound the fried rice on a serving platter and serve hot or warm.
