Remove the reheated eel from its package and cut it into three pieces crosswise, each about 4 inches long. Cut the head end and the middle pieces into 6 long strips lengthwise and cut the narrower tail section into 4 long strips, to make 16 strips. Line up all the filling ingredients—tsume, eel, daikon sprouts, cucumber, crabmeat, avocado, and arugula—on a tray. Now follow the instructions in the Master Recipe (My Mother's Classic Thick Roll) Additional Instructions: When you are using tsume in the roll, smear 1½ to 2 teaspoons across the center of each roll. Spread one-quarter of the fillings in the following order: eel, daikon sprouts, arugula, crabmeat, cucumber, and avocado. You can prepare this roll half a day in advance. Serve with or without an additional sauce.
