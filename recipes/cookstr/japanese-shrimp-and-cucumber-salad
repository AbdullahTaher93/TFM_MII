Cook the shrimp by plunging them in about 2 quarts of boiling water and boiling for 3 minutes for extra large shrimp and 4 minutes for jumbo. Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water. Peel the shrimp and, if you wish, devein them. Chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Halve the cucumbers lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop the seeds out of each half. Slice the halves into crescents about 1/8-inch thick. Combine the cucumber slices with the coarse salt, rub with your hands until you no longer feel the salt, then drain in a colander for 15 minutes. Wring out as much liquid as you can by squeezing small bunches of the slices in your fists. If youâ€™re not using the bonito flakes, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, water, and sugar in a small bowl and set aside. If you are using the bonito flakes, combine the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. As soon as the mixture reaches a boil, turn off the heat and add the bonito flakes. Let steep for 5 minutes, then strain. Discard the used bonito flakes and chill the sauce. Just before serving, add the scallions to the sauce. Serve the shrimp next to the cucumbers, with the sauce in a separate dish for dipping.
