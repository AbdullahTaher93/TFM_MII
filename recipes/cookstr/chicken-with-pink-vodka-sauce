Make the cream sauce by melting 2 tablespoons of the butter slowly. Add the flour and whisk until it becomes a paste. Slowly add the heavy cream while whisking over low heat. Once thickened to the desired thickness, set aside. To season the chicken breasts, sprinkle the chicken strips with the oregano, cayenne pepper (if using) and black pepper and set aside. In a large skillet heat the olive oil and remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Sauté the shallots and garlic until the shallots are translucent. Add the chicken, crushed red pepper, thyme and basil to the skillet. Cook the chicken thoroughly, until no pink remains. Remove the chicken and set aside. With the heat still on medium, add the vodka to the pan to deglaze. Reduce the vodka by half and add the chicken broth. Boil the liquids, reducing them to ½ cup. Add the marinara, cooked chicken and whisk in just enough of the prepared cream sauce to reach the consistency you desire. Simmer on low until ready to serve. While sauce is simmering, prepare the pasta according to the package directions in salted water and drain. Serve the sauce over the cooked pasta. Pass freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano separately. Variations: This sauce is delicious with chicken but you can also replace it with ground sausage, salmon and asparagus, or shrimp. Ouzo is an anise-flavored liquor that can replace the vodka for another delicious sauce.
