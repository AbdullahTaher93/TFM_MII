Place 1 mango in a blender or bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. Finely chop the remaining mango. Transfer the puree and the diced mango to separate bowls (you should have about 1/3 cup of each). Have ready a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl by the stove. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the cream, milk, and 1/3 cup of the sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Whisk the remaining 1/3 cup sugar with the egg yolks in a large, heatproof bowl until light and lemon-colored. Whisking constantly, slowly pour about a quarter of the hot cream mixture into the eggs to temper. Continuing to whisk, slowly pour in the remaining cream mixture, then transfer the custard back to the saucepan and place over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Do not let it boil or the custard will curdle. Strain and let cool, stirring occasionally. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours. Whisk the mango puree into the chilled custard and freeze in an electric ice cream maker following the manufacturersâ€™ instructions. Fold in the chopped mangoes, transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm.
