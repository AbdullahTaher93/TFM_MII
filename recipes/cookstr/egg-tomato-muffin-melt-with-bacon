Place bacon on a bacon rack or paper towel–lined plate. Cover with a paper towel. Microwave on High for 1 ½ to 3 minutes or until crisp. Set aside. Break an egg into each custard cup. Using a toothpick, pierce each yolk gently 3 to 4 times. Cover dishes with plastic wrap and turn back one corner to vent. Microwave on Medium-Low (30%) for 2 to 3 minutes or until egg whites are just set and yolks are still runny. For older or lower-wattage ovens, increase to Medium (50%) and cook eggs for 2 ½ to 4 minutes, rearranging dish once during cooking. Place 2 muffin halves on a paper towel–lined plate. Top with 2 half slices bacon and 2 tomato slices. Remove eggs from cups and place on top of tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with cheese. Microwave, uncovered, on Medium (50%) for 1 to 2 minutes or until cheese melts. Arrange remaining English muffin halves on top. Serve immediately.
