In a small bowl, mix together the sea salt and rosemary. Set aside. Pour enough oil into a large saucepan to reach a depth of 1 inch. Set the pan over medium heat and heat the oil to 350Â°F. Test the oil by dropping in a sliver of sweet potato. It should sizzle immediately. Using a mandoline or a sharp chefs knife, slice the potatoes crosswise into very thin rounds, about 1/16 of an inch thick. Carefully drop a handful of potato slices into the hot oil. Use a skimmer or large slotted spoon to turn the potato slices frequently, and fry them for about 2 minutes, or just until they are golden brown. Carefully but quickly remove them from the oil to a large paper-towel-lined rimmed baking sheet or a large brown paper bag to drain. Continue to fry the sweet potatoes in batches until you have fried them all. Let the chips cool to room temperature. Sprinkle some of the rosemary salt over the chips and place the chips in a decorative bowl or napkin-lined basket. Serve the chips at room temperature.
