1 Prepare the Pad Thai sauce. You can buy premixed tamarind concentrate or make your own Tamarind Juice. This sauce keeps well in the refrigerator for several months. Be sure to cool the sauce before use. It adheres better to the noodles when cold, so they will absorb the flavors more fully. 2 Combine all sauce ingredients in a sauce-pan and cook over medium-low heat for about 60 minutes, until syrupy. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Allow to cool. 3 Heat the oil in a wok. Add the garlic and stir-fry until golden brown. Add the shrimp and pork, if using, and keep stirring until the shrimp changes color. Remove the shrimp to prevent overcooking and set aside. Stir in the dried shrimp, if using, and preserved radish. 4 Add the noodles. They will stick together, so stir fast and try to keep them separate. Add a little water, stirring a few times. Add the Pad Thai sauce and continue stirring until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed. The noodles should appear soft and moist. Return the cooked shrimp to the wok. 5 Push the contents of the wok up around the sides to make room to fry the eggs. If the pan is very dry, add 1 more tablespoon of oil. Add the eggs, stir lightly to break yolks, and cover them with the noodles. When the eggs are cooked, stir them into the noodles until everything is well mixed; this should result in cooked bits of eggs, both whites and yolk, throughout the noodle mixture. 6 Add the chilies, peanuts, garlic chives, and bean sprouts. Mix well. Transfer to a serving platter. Serve with raw bean spouts, lime wedges, and a few squeezes of lime juice.
