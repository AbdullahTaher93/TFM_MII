For The Sauternes Jelly: Place the Sauternes wine in a heavy small saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over the top. Let stand until the gelatin softens, about 5 minutes. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Whisk over low heat until the gelatin is dissolved, about 1 minute. Strain the wine mixture into a miniature loaf pan so that the mixture is about 1 inch deep. Cover and refrigerate until the mixture is softly set, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. For The Roasted Pears And Syrup: Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into a heavy medium saucepan; add the bean. Add the water, sugar, chile, star anise, and cinnamon. Bring the liquid to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the pears. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until a skewer pierces the pears easily, turning the pears occasionally, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pears to a medium bowl. Cool the pears and poaching syrup separately. Strain the cooled poaching syrup through a fine-mesh strainer and into a small bowl. Cut the pears lengthwise in half. Using a melon baller, remove the core and seeds from the pears. To Finish And Serve: Sprinkle the foie gras with fleur de sel and pepper. Preheat the grill to high heat. Add the foie gras and cook until deep golden brown markings appear, pressing with a spatula, about 1 minute per side. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the center of the foie gras is warm, about 2 minutes longer per side. Transfer the foie gras to paper towels to absorb excess oil. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a heavy large saute pan over medium high heat. Add the pears and cook until the pears are heated through and begin to brown, about 2 minutes per side. Cut the jelly crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Place 1 foie gras slice in the center of each of 4 wide shallow bowls. Place 1 pear half alongside each foie gras. Place 1 jelly slice along the opposite side of the foie gras. Drizzle the chilled poaching syrup around the foie gras and serve immediately.
