Line a large platter, including rim, with prosciutto. Set aside. In a covered pasta pot over high heat, bring water to a rapid boil. Add salt and fettuccine and cook, uncovered, until pasta is almost al dente. Scoop out about 1 cup (250 mL) of the pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta. In a large sauté pan over medium heat, heat 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the reserved pasta water and the butter and peas. Cook, stirring, until butter melts. Add cream, white pepper and 1 cup (250 mL) of the Parmigiano-Reggiano and simmer for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Ladle out about 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the cream mixture (without including peas) and transfer to a small bowl. Add egg yolks and whisk well. Set aside. Add fettuccine to sauté pan and continue to cook for about 3 minutes, until pasta is al dente. Using a wooden spoon, toss to coat evenly, adding more pasta water if necessary. Remove from heat. Add reserved egg yolk mixture (do not return to heat or you will scramble the eggs), and toss to coat evenly while eggs cook in the residual heat. Transfer to prosciutto-lined platter and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
