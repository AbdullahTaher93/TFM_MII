To make the sauce: In a large serving bowl, combine the garlic, onion, lemon juice, chile, salt and pepper to taste, and anchovy (if using). Set aside. To make the pasta: Bring 6 quarts salted water to a boil in an 8-quart pot. Drop the pasta into the boiling water. Add the zucchini to the pasta in the water 4 minutes before the pasta is done (check the box for timing). Once the pasta is tender but still has a little bite (al dente), scoop up Â½ cup pasta water and set aside. Immediately drain the pasta and zucchini in a colander. To finish the paste: Stir the reserved hot pasta water into the lemon juice mixture along with the basil, mint, oregano, olives, and oil. Add the drained pasta and zuccini and toss to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste (be generous with the black pepper), and then toss with the almonds and cheese. Serve hot.
