To Make the Simple Syrup: In a saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil over high heat. Boil for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar completely. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. To Make the Margaritas: Fill a large cocktail shaker with ice. Add the tequila, Cointreau, syrup, and lime juice and shake vigorously. Serve in chilled martini glasses, with or without salted rims, and garnished with lime wedges.
