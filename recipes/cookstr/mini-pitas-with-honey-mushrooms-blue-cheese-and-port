Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat until foaming. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high and stir in the mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are lightly browned and softened, about 4 minutes. Transfer the mushroom mixture to a medium-size bowl and cool completely. Add the blue cheese, port, and pepper to the mushroom mixture and stir gently until mixed. Taste and add salt if needed. Stir the walnuts and chives together in a shallow bowl. Cut the pitas in half crosswise to form two pockets. Divide the mushroom mixture among the pita pockets, spreading it to fill each pocket evenly. Gently dip the edge of the exposed filling into the walnut-chive mixture and arrange the mini pitas, filling side up, on a serving platter.
