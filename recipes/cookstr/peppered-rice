Melt butter in a large saucepan. Add bell pepper and onion and cook until onion is softened. Add garlic, cumin, and rice, and stir until well mixed. Add broth. Cover and steam 15 minutes without peeking, then stir. If not as tender as desired, cook to the desired doneness, adding more stock if needed.
