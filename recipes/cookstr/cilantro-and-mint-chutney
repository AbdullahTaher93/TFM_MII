We Punjabis eat this chutney wit most of our snacks and appetizers and even spread it in sandwiches. It is absolutely delicious and really simple to make. It is fresh and herby and great with grilled foods too. It is best eaten soon after it has been made as the color will fade, but it can be kept in the fridge for a few days. Blend all the ingredients together with 2 tablespoons of water to make a smooth puree. Taste and adjust the salt and lemon juice to taste.
