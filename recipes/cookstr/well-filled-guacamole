Halve the avocados and remove the pits. Use a spoon to scoop out the pulp and place it in a bowl. Remove the husks from the tomatillos. Rinse the tomatillos; chop them fine. Add to the avocado, along with the lime juice and salt. Mash with a fork until the avocado is mostly smooth with a few lumps here and there. Use right away or store as described in Chopped Avocado.
