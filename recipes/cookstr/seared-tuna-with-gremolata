To make the gremolata, pulse together the lime juice and pulp, garlic, onion, parsley, chives, avocado oil, and a good pinch of salt in a food processor or blender until the sauce is slightly chunky, but homogenous. Put the lime zest, chili flakes, and a little sea salt on a plate. Pat the tuna steaks on the plate, covering each piece with the mixture. Add the Â½ tablespoon of oil to a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and wavy, place the tuna steaks in the pan and sear 1-2 minutes per side. Tuna is best eaten rare to medium rare. To serve, simply plate the fish and spoon loads of gremolata on top. If you have extra limes, serve some extra wedges with the fish. A good splash of fresh lime juice always makes things taste just a little brighter.
