Preheat the oven to 500°F. Fill a large saucepan with water and bring to the boil. While it’s heating up, put the garlic olive oil in an ovenproof dish; I use an enamel Le Creuset one, measuring 12 x 8 inches. Remove the rind from the pancetta and put it in the dish (to render down: you want as much bacony juices as possible), then dice the rest of the pancetta and add these cubes to the oil, smooshing them about with your fingers to make sure they’re equally, if lightly, coated. When the water is boiling, put the dish of garlic-oiled pancetta in the oven, then salt the boiling water and add the linguine; these should need about 10 minutes to cook. When the pasta is ready, drain it, reserving a scant cupful of the cooking water and take the pancetta dish out of the oven. Tip the drained linguine into the dish and toss well, adding some of the pasta-cooking water, drop by cautious drop, for lubrication as you need it. And that’s it: I like this without Parmesan, but a sprinkling of roughly scissored parsley, should you feel inclined, is always a good idea.
