Mix the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips. Make a well in the center and pour in the tepid water and milk. Stir with a wooden spoon to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until smooth. Place in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in volume. Lightly flour 2 large baking sheets. Knead the dough on a work surface until smooth. Divide it into 8 equal balls. Roll each into a flat round about 4in (10cm) wide. Poke a hole through the center of each with the handle end of a wooden spoon. Place on the baking sheet and prick lightly with a fork. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for about 20 minutes until puffy. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Bake for about 15 minutes, or lightly golden. Transfer the breads to a wire cake rack and cool.
