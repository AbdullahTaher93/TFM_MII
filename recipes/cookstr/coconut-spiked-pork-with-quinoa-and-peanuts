In a blender, combine stock, coconut milk and peanuts. Process until smooth. Set aside. In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat for 30 seconds. Add pork, in batches if necessary, and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Add leeks to pan and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, chile pepper, cumin, salt and black pepper to taste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add tomatoes with juice and reserved peanut mixture and bring to a boil. Stir in quinoa and green beans and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Stir in pork and any accumulated juices. Cover and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes.
