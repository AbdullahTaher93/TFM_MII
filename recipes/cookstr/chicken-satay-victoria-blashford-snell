Cut the chicken into thin strips across the grain of the meat. Spread the strips out in a shallow, nonmetallic dish. In a small bowl, mix kecap manis, brown sugar, lime juice, ginger, garlic, coriander, lemongrass, cumin, salt, and 2 tsp vegetable oil. Pour over the chicken and toss to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. To make the satay sauce, put the peanut butter with half of the garlic in a small saucepan and cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Add the coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, and ginger, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until heated through. Add the lemon juice and remaining garlic, and season to taste with cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce cool, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. When ready to cook, thread the chicken on soaked and drained wooden skewers. In a pan over low heat, reheat the satay sauce, stirring frequently. Brush the chicken with oil and broil or grill on an outdoor grill for 5 minutes, turning over once or twice, until the chicken is opaque throughout. Garnish with lime wedges and serve hot with satay sauce.
