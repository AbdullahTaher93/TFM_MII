Peel the regular tomatoes (see headnote) or the cherry or grape tomatoes, if desired. Cut regular tomatoes into wedges about ¾-inch wide on the outside. The exact number of wedges per tomato depends on the size of the tomatoes—usually you’ll have between 6 and 12. As an additional refinement, you can remove the seeds by sliding your finger along the side of each of the wedges and pushing the seeds out. If you’re using cherry or grape tomatoes, cut them in half through the side. Cook the shrimp by plunging them in about 3 quarts of boiling water and boiling for 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water. Peel the shrimp and, if you wish, devein them. Just before serving, combine the shrimp with the tomatoes, sprinkle with the herbs if you’re using them, add the oil and vinegar, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Decorate each serving with a sprig of parsley or chervil, if desired.
