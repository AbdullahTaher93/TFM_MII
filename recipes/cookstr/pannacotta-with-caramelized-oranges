Put the milk, vanilla beans, vanilla seeds, orange zest and half the cream into a small pan and slowly simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the softened gelatine. Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then place in the fridge, stirring occasionally until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Remove the vanilla beans. Whip together the powdered sugar with the remaining cream, then mix the two cream mixtures together. Divide into 4 serving moulds, or you can use espresso cups. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour in the fridge. Peel the oranges using a knife and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Sprinkle with the sugar and place on a baking pan. Caramelize under a hot broiler or using a blow torch until golden brown. Turn out your panna cotta by dipping the molds into hot water for 10 seconds or serve straight from the espresso cups. Turn out on a plate and serve with slices of the orange and some of the caramel juices.
