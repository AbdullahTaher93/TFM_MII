Preheat oven to 450째F (230째C). Season beef with salt and pepper. Fold the pointed end under and tie in place to form a cylinder of uniform thickness. Rub the outside of the beef with oil. Place on a rack in a metal roasting pan and roast for 16 to 20 minutes, turning beef halfway through, until a meat thermometer inserted in the center registers 125째F (52째C) for rare, or until desired doneness. Transfer to a carving board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, place roasting pan over medium heat until juices are bubbling. Add wine and boil for 1 minute, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Serve beef with red wine jus.
