Bring the rice, bouillon, and 3Â¾ cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the rice is just tender. Drain the rice well. Transfer to a bowl, stir in the Gruyere and pesto, and let cool. Using moistened hands, roll the rice into walnut-sized balls. Coat in the bread crumbs. Add enough oil to come halfway up the sides of a heavy frying pan and heat over high heat until the oil is simmering. In batches, fry the rice balls about 3 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve hot.
