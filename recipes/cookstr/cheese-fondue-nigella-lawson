Put the chopped or grated cheese into the fondue pot with the wine and heat until boiling on the stove, by which time the cheese should have melted. Turn the pot down to a simmer. Slake (whisk together) the cornstarch with the Kirsch in a small bowl, and add to the fondue pot along with the garlic clove. Season with the pepper and nutmeg and move the fondue pot onto a flame at the table.
