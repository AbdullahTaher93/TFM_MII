Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, celery, squash, and carrots and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes. Add the beans, water, and oregano. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour, or until beans are tender. Add the tomatoes and salt. Cook, covered, 10 minutes. The recipe can be made ahead until this point. Refrigerate until ready to continue. Bring to a boil, stir in macaroni, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add 1 cup Parmesan cheese, and let stand 5 minutes before serving. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve with additional parsley, if desired, and cheese.
