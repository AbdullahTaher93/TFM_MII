Grate the carrots and parsnips on a box grater or in a food processor. Put in a dish towel and squeeze to remove water. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, flour, salt, and ginger. Stir in the grated vegetables. Drizzle with the honey and stir to combine. Pour oil to depth of 1/8 inch in a large skillet and heat over medium heat. Drop the vegetable mixture by serving-spoonfuls (about 3 tablespoons) into 3½-inch discs. Fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Serve with dollops of crème fraîche on top.
