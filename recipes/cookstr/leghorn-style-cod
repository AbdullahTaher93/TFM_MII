Spread the flour out on a clean, dry surface and season it with salt and pepper. Press both sides of the fillets into the flour. Reserve. Warm the vegetable oil in a pan wide and deep enough to hold the fish without crowding over high heat. Add the fish, skinned-side down, and cook until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes more. Transfer the fish to paper towels to drain. Warm the olive oil in a pan wide and deep enough to hold all the ingredients over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper to the pan, stir, and cook until the garlic has colored slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 minute. Add the fish, lower the heat to low, and cook until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the fish to a serving platter, and spoon some sauce over each fillet. Top with minced parsley and serve immediately.
