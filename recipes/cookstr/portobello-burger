Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Place the portobello caps on the baking sheet and roast for 10 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a heatproof surface. Top each mushroom with ½ cup arugula, 2 slices tomato and a quarter of the cheese. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Return to the oven and roast until the arugula wilts and the cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
