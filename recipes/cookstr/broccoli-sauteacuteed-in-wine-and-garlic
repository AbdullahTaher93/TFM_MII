In a 10- to 12-inch saut√© pan, heat the olive oil with the garlic over medium-high heat until just sizzling. Add the broccoli and cook, tossing frequently and gradually adding the wine to keep the garlic from browning, until the stalks are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and zests, tossing well and serve immediately.
