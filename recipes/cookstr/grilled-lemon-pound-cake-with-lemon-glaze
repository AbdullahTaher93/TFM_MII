In a small microwavable bowl, whisk together the sugar, orange juice, and lemon juice and heat in the microwave for 20 seconds. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves and set it aside. (If the glaze gets too hot, the flavors of the juices change; be careful.) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 12 x 4½ x 2½-inch cake pan with butter and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, combine the sugar, almond paste, lemon zest, and orange zest on medium speed. Mix thoroughly, but don’t expect the mixture to come together. Add the butter and vanilla and cream together until light and fluffy. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix, incorporating each one fully before adding the next. Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the batter and mix until everything is just incorporated; do not overmix. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and finish mixing with a wooden spoon. Pour the batter into the reserved cake pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake. Run a knife around the edge of the cake and flip it over onto a cooling rack. Place another cooling rack on top. While it’s still warm, poke holes in the cake using a toothpick and pour the glaze over it through the cooling rack, which will help distribute the glaze evenly. Let the cake cool for at least 1 hour. To serve: Slice the cake into ½-inch slices and cook each piece on both sides on a hot grill for 30 seconds. Serve with slow-roasted fruit, a scoop of basil gelato, and a drizzle of olive oil.
