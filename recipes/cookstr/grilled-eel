In a small stockpot, add the soy sauce, green onions, garlic, ginger, sugar, rice wine, sesame oil, and black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and, stirring occasionally, simmer for about 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly. Meanwhile clean the eels, removing the heads and entrails. Halve the eels lengthwise, removing the bones. Then cut the halves into about 2- to 3-inch widths. Grill the eel pieces on an oiled grill. Baste the eels with the seasoning and grill again. The fish should be white all the way through and slightly charred and browned on the edges. Serve with several leaves of red curly leaf lettuce or just with rice, banchan, and kimchi.
