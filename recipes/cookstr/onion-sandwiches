Slice brioche in slices one quarter of an inch thick and cut in rounds with a canapé cutter or a small biscuit cutter. Spread the rounds with mayonnaise. On half the slices places a very thin slice of raw onion, just the size of the round, and salt it well. Place another slice of brioche on top; roll the edges first in mayonnaise and then in finely chopped parsley. Not only is this delicious, but it is one of the most decorative canapés you can make, for the edging of brilliant green enhances the golden yellow of the brioche and makes it a most appetizing tidbit. This same process may be used for tiny anchovy canapés. Spread the rounds of brioche with fines herbs butter and places fillets of anchovies on one half of the slices. Top with a second slice of the buttered brioche; roll the edges in mayonnaise and then in chopped parsley.
