6 to 8 10-inch bamboo or metal skewers (if bamboo, soaked in cold water to cover for 1 hour) Put the scallops in a bowl. Mix the Ginger Marinade ingredients and pour them over the scallops, tossing lightly to coat. Cover with plastic wrap, and let the scallops sit at least 30 minutes. Alternately thread the peppers and the scallops onto the bamboo skewers, starting and ending with the peppers. Brush the scallops and peppers with the marinade. Mix the Cilantro Dressing ingredients in a bowl. Trim the wilted or any hard stems from the snow pea shoots or baby greens and place near the stove. Pour the Cilantro Dressing into a serving container. Heat a wok or large skillet, add the oil, and heat until near smoking. Add the greens and garlic and toss lightly about 20 seconds, then add the rice wine and salt, and toss lightly over high heat about 1 minute or less, until the greens are slightly wilted but still bright green. Spoon the greens onto a serving platter and mound slightly so that the scallops can be arranged on top. Prepare a fire for grilling and arrange the skewers of scallops and peppers about 3 inches from the source of heat. Broil or grill about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, turning once and brushing with the marinade. Arrange the cooked scallops and peppers over the wilted greens, leaving them on the skewers or removing them. Spoon the Cilantro Dressing on top or serve on the side. Serve warm.
