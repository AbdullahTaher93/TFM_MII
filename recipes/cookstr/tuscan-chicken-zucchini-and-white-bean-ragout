Pour the olive oil into a 2-quart saucepan and heat over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened but not brown, 2 minutes. Add the chicken and the zucchini and continue to cook, stirring, until the zucchini softens, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the beans, cream, if using, and thyme. Season the ragout with salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking until the beans are heated through and the flavors are combined, 2 minutes longer. Spoon the ragout into serving bowls and serve the Parmesan cheese, if using, on the side.
