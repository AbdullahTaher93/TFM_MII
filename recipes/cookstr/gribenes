Pour 2 tablespoons water in a large, heavy skillet, then add the chicken fat and skin. (The steam from the water as it evaporates will prevent the skin from burning when it comes in contact with the hot pan.) Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring often to prevent sticking, until all the fat has rendered, about 20 minutes. Add the onion and continue simmering until the skin and onion are brown and crisp, 20 to 30 minutes. As the onion and skin begin to brown, stir more often to prevent the skin pieces from sticking to the pan. Remove the skillet from the heat and for safety’s sake, allow the mixture to cool to lukewarm in the skillet. (If you’re not going to listen to me, at least warm the jars before you pour the hot fat into them.) Strain the schmaltz through a fine-mesh strainer into clean glass jars, and cover the jars tightly. Don’t be alarmed if there are tiny dark particles that sink to the bottom. The schmaltz will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks and in the freezer for months. Use the fat in place of oil for frying anything from onins to liver--and especially in place of oil for matzoh balls. Drain the gribenes on paper towels and sprinkle with salt to taste. Serve the gribenes plain as a snack or schmeared on bread, or use it in chopped liver, matzoh balls, or mashed potatoes.
