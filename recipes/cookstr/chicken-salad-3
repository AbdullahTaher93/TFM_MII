Put the turkey or chicken chunks in a bowl and massage the chunks between your thumb and first three fingers until they are frayed on the edges and semisoft in the center. Once you have the proper texture, start adding mayonnaise. Because breast meat has a dry texture, it will absorb the oil from the mayonnaise, so what’s left on the outside will be the white, creamy, tasty part of the mayonnaise. As for how much mayonnaise you add, it’s a feel thing. It’s like making risotto where you add broth a little at a time until the rice is cooked. Add the mayonnaise a little at a time, and as soon as the molecules of the meat have been filled and the mayonnaise has nowhere else to go, stop. You can then season the salad with salt and pepper if you like. I don’t.
