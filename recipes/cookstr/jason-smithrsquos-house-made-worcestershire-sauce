Take a 5-quart Dutch oven and place over medium heat. Add the olive oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, pour in the onions and jalape√±os. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have taken on some color and both vegetables are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Now pour in both corn syrups, the vinegar, water, anchovies, garlic, molasses, cloves, pepper, and horseradish. Stir the ingredients to combine, and keep at a simmer until it has reduced by about one-half, which could take as long as 2 hours. Keep a close eye and stir occasionally to prevent anything from sticking to the bottom of your pot. Add the broth, lemon juice, and the reserved rinds. Stir well to combine, and keep at a simmer for approximately another hour, or until the sauce is reduced, coats the back of a spoon, and is a bit syrupy. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve, discarding the solids. Let cool slightly, then taste and add salt or more lemon juice as you see fit. Let cool completely and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator indefinitely.
