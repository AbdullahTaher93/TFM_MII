Heat 3 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan; stir in the rice. Cook, covered, over medium-low heat until tender, 35 to 55 minutes, depending on the rice. Uncover and cook to evaporate any excess liquid; or let stand, covered, until any remaining water is absorbed. Let cool to room temperature. Whisk the oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and a grinding of black pepper in a large bowl. Add the rice, turkey, grapes, cranberries, hazelnuts, parsley, and scallions; toss blend. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed. Serve at room temperature.
