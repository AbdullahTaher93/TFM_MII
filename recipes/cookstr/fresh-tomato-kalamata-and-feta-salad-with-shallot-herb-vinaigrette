To make the vinaigrette, combine the first 6 ingredients in a bowl and whisk. While continuing to whisk, gradually add oil in a thin stream. It should be slightly thick. Season the vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. The vinaigrette may be made ahead and refrigerated. Arrange tomatoes on either a large platter to pass or on individual salad plates. Sprinkle with olives and feta cheese. Drizzle with desired amount of dressing. Cover and refrigerate remaining vinaigrette. The vinaigrette may be stored for up to a month and used on a variety of salads. Variation: Substitute cooked and crumbled bacon in place of olives for a different flavor.
