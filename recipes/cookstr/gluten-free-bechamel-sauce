Put the milk into a saucepan with the carrot, onion, peppercorns, thyme, and parsley. Bring to a boil, simmer for 4-5 minutes, remove from the heat and cool. Strain the vegetables. Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the cornstarch and rice flour. Combine the mixture with a wooden spoon and cook for 2 minutes over a low heat. Pour in the milk, whisking continuously, and allow to thicken. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. For a thinner sauce, add a little extra milk until you achieve the required consistency.
