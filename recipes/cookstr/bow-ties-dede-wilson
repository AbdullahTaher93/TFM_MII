In a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed, beat eggs until thick and creamy. Beat in rum and vanilla. Wash and dry beaters of mixer. In another large bowl, combine flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Add butter and beat on medium speed until mixture has an even crumb. Add wet mixture to dry, beating on medium-low speed until a soft but not sticky dough forms. Run mixer for a minute or two to knead dough. Heat 2 inches of oil or shortening (or a Blend) in a deep-fat fryer or deep, heavy pot to 375 degrees F. Roll dough out to 1/8-inch thickness on lightly floured surface. Cut a grid, using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, making 1½ × 5-inch rectangles. Make a 1-inch slit lengthwise in the center of each rectangle. Pull one end of strip through the slit, forming a loose knot for each cookie. Stretch each piece out gently to form bow-tie shapes. Add a few knots to the hot fat at a time and fry for about 1 minute, then flip over using tongs and fry until light golden brown on all sides, about 1 minute more. Do not crowd; the knots need room to move around. Remove using slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining knots. While cookies are still warm, place on a rimmed cookie sheet or in a large bowl, sift confectioners’ sugar over them, and gently toss to coat heavily. I like these best within a few hours of frying.
