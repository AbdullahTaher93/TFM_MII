Clean and pick through beans for any small stones and grit. Rinse several times in cold water until water is fairly clear. Soak beans and rice in 2 cups (500 mL) water at room temperature for 45 minutes or for up to 3 hours. Drain well. Add to a food processor and process coarsely. Transfer to a bowl. Add chiles, onion, mashed potato, cilantro, ginger, if using, salt and asafetida and mix well. Add ¾ cup (175 mL) water, adding just enough to make a batter slightly thicker than pancake batter. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of water flicked on it sizzles. Add 1 tsp (5 mL) of the oil and tilt skillet to spread oil. Ladle ½ cup (125 mL) batter into center and spread quickly with back of ladle to form a pancake about ¼ inch (0.5 cm) thick. Make a hole in the center. Spoon 1 tsp (5 mL) of the oil in the center and some around edges. Cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Continue with remaining batter and oil. Serve with a chutney or Indian pickle of your choice.
