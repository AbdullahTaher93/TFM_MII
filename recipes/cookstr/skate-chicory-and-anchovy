To make your poaching broth mix all the ingredients together and add enough water to cover your skate. Bring it up to a boil and then turn the heat down to a simmer. Slip your skate wing into the poaching pan and cook for approximately 10 minutes (check that the flesh comes away from the bone), then turn off the heat and allow to cool in the liquor. When cold remove the skate from the liquor and pull the flesh from the bone. It should come away in easy strips. Now make your dressing: either whizz all the ingredients in a food processor or pound them in a mortar with a pestle. Bring together the skate, chicory, rocket (arugula), parsley, capers, and the dressing (cautionâ€”there may be too much, so do not add it all at once), and toss.
