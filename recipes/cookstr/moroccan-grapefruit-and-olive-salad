With a sharp knife, cut peel and pith away from whole grapefruits; cut on either side of membranes to release grapefruit segments. Put skinned grapefruit segments into a salad bowl. Scatter onions and olives over the grapefruit. Do not mix. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, paprika, salt, pepper and garlic until slightly emulsified. Drizzle dressing over the grapefruit, onions and olives in the salad bowl. Fold gently, several times to mix ingredients and distribute the dressing. The salad can wait, covered and unrefrigerated, for up to 1 hour. Place a lettuce leaf on each of 4 plates. Portion out the salad equally on top of the lettuce. Garnish with coriander and serve immediately.
