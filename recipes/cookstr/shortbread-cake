Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch cake pan and set aside. Combine the quinoa and brown rice flours, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl, and set aside. Place the flaxseeds in a blender and grind to a powder. Add the juice, oil, maple syrup, almond milk, and vanilla, and blend well. Add to the flour mixture and stir to form a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool 30 minutes before removing from the pan. Slice and serve.
