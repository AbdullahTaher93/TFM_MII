Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the meat and brown for 10 minutes. Do not drain the liquid. Add the bell pepper, onion, potatoes, garlic, chile, and tomatoes and continue cooking for 10 minutes. Add the spices, the tomato sauce, and 2 cups water. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is very tender. Add more water as required. Season to taste. In a small cup combine 3 tablespoons cooking liquid with the flour. Stir to remove any lumps, then add to the carne guisada, mixing well until evenly thickened.
