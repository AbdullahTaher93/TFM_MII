Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add 1 tablespoon of salt. Stir in the pasta. Cook until al dente, stirring often. Meanwhile, combine the chives, parsley, fennel, arugula, and oil in a bowl. Put the ricotta in another bowl. Drain the pasta well, saving 1 cup of hot pasta water. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl. Add Â½ cup of the hot pasta water to the ricotta and combine well. Spoon ricotta and pecorino over the pasta and add the mixed herbs and oil. Toss. If too dry, add a little more pasta water. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
