Holding a sharp knife or a cleaver parallel to the cutting board, score each shrimp along the back. (The scoring will allow the shrimp to curl when cooked.) Place the shrimp in a bowl and add the Shrimp Marinade. Toss lightly to coat the shrimp and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes, or longer if possible. Mix the Sweet and Sour Hawthorn Sauce in a saucepan and heat until thickened, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Keep warm and, before serving, pour it into a small serving dish. Add the egg to the marinated shrimp and thread four shrimp per skewer. Place the white and black sesame seeds on separate plates. Dip one side of the skewered shrimp in the white sesame seeds, turn over, and dip the other side in the black. Arrange on a cookie sheet. Heat a large skillet, add the olive oil, and heat to about 375Â°F. Lay 3 or 4 of the skewers in the pan and fry until the white sesame seeds are golden brown, about 3 minutes; then turn and fry the black seeds, about 3 minutes. Remove with a pair of tongs, and drain briefly in a colander; then drain on absorbent paper. Reheat the oil when necessary before adding the next batch and skim the loose sesame seeds from the oil between batches. Arrange the drained shrimp on a serving platter, alternating white and black sides. Serve with the Sweet and Sour Hawthorn Sauce.
