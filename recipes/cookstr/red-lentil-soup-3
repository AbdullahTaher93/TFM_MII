Rinse the red lentils in a sieve. Place them in a soup pot with the water, turmeric, bay leaves, garlic, ginger, and 1 teaspoon of the salt and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally as they come to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, until soft, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, warm the olive oil in a covered skillet or saucepan on medium-low heat. Add the onions and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes. Increase the heat, add the carrots, and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in the potatoes, cumin, and coriander and cook, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes. Stir in the water and bell peppers and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add the tomatoes and simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and ginger slices from the cooked lentils and discard them. Stir in the cooked vegetables. Stir in the lemon juice, cilantro, and the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Season with black pepper to taste.
