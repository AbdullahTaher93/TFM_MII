In a large saucepan bring the wine to a boil, add the scallops, return to a boil, then remove from the heat and drain. In a skillet heat the oil, then sauté the onion and ham until the onion is wilted. Mix in the scallops and remove from the heat. Place the scallop mixture in 6 scallop shells. Sprinkle with salt [May be prepared ahead] and bake at 400°F for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with bread crumbs (about 2 teaspoons for each shell), dot with butter, and run under the broiler until golden. VARIATION A similar recipe, but simpler because the ingredients are not cooked first, calls for ½ cup finely diced Serrano ham, ½ cup very finely chopped onion, a few drops white wine vinegar, 5 tablespoons olive oil, salt, 2 tablespoons minced parsley, and 1 cup fresh bread crumbs. Place the scallops and ham in buttered shells. Sprinkle on some onion, a little vinegar, and 1 teaspoon of the oil over each. Season with salt and sprinkle with the parsley. In a small bowl mix the crumbs with the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil, divide among the shells, and bake at 400°F for 15 minutes.
