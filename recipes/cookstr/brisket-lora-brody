Preheat the oven to 325°F. with the rack in the lower third but not the bottom position. Place the brisket in the cooking bag and place the bag in a shallow roasting pan large enough to hold it comfortably. Add the water, onions, celery, chili sauce, garlic, bay leaves, brown sugar, mustard, soy sauce, vinegar, molasses, and the beer to the bag. Seal the bag and puncture the top in several places with a knife. Bake for 3 hours. At the end of the cooking time, remove the pan from the oven and let the brisket cool slightly. Cut open the bag and remove the meat. Pour the sauce into a metal bowl. Discard the bay leaves. Place the sauce in the refrigerator or freezer until it is cold and the fat congeals on top. Slice the meat and refrigerate until ready to serve. Skim the fat off the sauce, then place the sauce and the meat in a casserole or heatproof serving dish. Add the paprika and the precooked potatoes, cover, and reheat on top of the stove or in the oven at 400°F. for 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.
