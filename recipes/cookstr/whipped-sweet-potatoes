Place the sweet potatoes, carrots, and bouillon cubes in a large heavy pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain, reserving 6 tablespoons of the cooking liquid, and place in a bowl. Using a mixer, whip the vegetables with the reserved cooking liquid and the remaining ingredients. Serve immediately, or reheat in a double boiler or, covered, in a 350Â°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
