FIRST Prepare the Teriyaki Sauce: Put the ingredients in a saucepan and bring them to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Let cool slightly. SECOND Cut the beef across the grain into thin strips that are 3 inches long and Â¼ inch thick. Thread the meat through the skewers so that the pieces lie flat, alternating with the scallion sections, starting and ending with the scallion sections. Arrange the skewers on a pan that has been lined with aluminum foil. THIRD Liberally brush the beef with the teriyaki sauce and let marinate for 1 hour or overnight, in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap. FOURTH Prepare a medium-hot fire for grilling or heat the broiler. Arrange the skewered beef and scallions on the grill or broil about 3 to 4 inches from the source of heat and cook, turning once, for about 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare, or longer as desired. Remove and arrange on a serving platter, and serve.
