Soak the beans in cold water to cover overnight. Preheat the oven to 300°F. Drain the beans and combine in a 2½-quart bean pot or covered casserole with the maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, mustard, salt, and pepper. Add the onion and salt pork. Pour enough boiling water over the beans to cover them by ½ inch. Bake, covered, for 6 hours, or until the beans are almost tender. Check every hour or so and if the sauce is below the level of the beans, add more boiling water to cover the beans. Uncover and finish cooking for an additional 45 to 60 minutes, until the beans are tender and a rich brown and the sauce is lightly thickened.
