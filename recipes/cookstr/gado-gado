1 Spread the greens on a large serving platter and sprinkle the sprouts over them. 2 Place the green beans, cauliflower, and carrots side by side, without mixing, in a wide skillet with about Â¼ inch of water. Cover and steam for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all are tender-crisp. Remove each type of vegetable separately with a slotted spoon, transfer to a colander, and refresh under cool water. Transfer each vegetable to a small plate. 3 Arrange the green beans, cauliflower, and carrots in separate mounds on the greens, leaving room to add the tomatoes and tofu. Arrange those on the greens as well, between the cooked vegetables. 4 To serve, let everyone scoop the vegetables, tofu, and greens onto individual plates, then pass the dressing for everyone to use as desired.
