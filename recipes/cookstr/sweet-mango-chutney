Peel mangoes. Holding each vertically with stem end up, slice down both sides with a very sharp knife, as close to the seed as possible. Lay each side on a board, flat side down, and cut into 4 long pieces. Cut the fleshy portion along both sides of the pit and discard pit. Place mango slices in a glass or non-reactive dish. Sprinkle with salt and rub in well with fingers to coat pieces. Cover and set in the sun for 3 to 4 hours. Drain mangoes and set aside. In a saucepan over low heat, dissolve sugar in ½ cup (125 mL) water. Add mangoes, garlic, cayenne pepper, ginger, nigella and cumin seeds and peppercorns. Increase heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally until mixture thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. Do not mash mango slices. Add ¼ cup (50 mL) of the vinegar and stir gently. When absorbed, stir in remaining vinegar. Cook for 2 minutes longer or until absorbed. Let cool to room temperature and store in a bottle.
