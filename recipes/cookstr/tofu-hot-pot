In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, garlic, salt, and sesame oil. Set aside. In a stone pot or other pot, add the tofu, clams, and 1 cup beef stock. Bring to a boil and add squid, shrimp, and seasoning. Let simmer another few minutes until the seafood is cooked. Add the green onions and cook for about another 1 to 2 minutes. Serve bubbling hot with a raw egg to add to the broth immediately. Serve with rice and kimchi.
