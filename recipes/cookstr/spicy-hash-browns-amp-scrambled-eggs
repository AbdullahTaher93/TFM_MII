Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the potatoes. Lower the heat and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and let cool. Skin the potatoes and cut into Â½-inch dice. In a large skillet, heat the oil and melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the potatoes, garlic salt, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring gently, until the potatoes begin to turn brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. In another skillet, prepare scrambled eggs to taste. Serve the eggs and hash browns with salsa, if desired.
