Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9-inch pie plate. To make the filling, in a medium bowl, combine the berries, Sucanat, lemon zest, and flour. To make the topping, in a food processor, pulse the oats, Sucanat, flour, butter, walnuts, and cinnamon until just combined. Pour the berry filling into the prepared pan and sprinkle the topping over the top. Bake until the topping is golden brown and the juice is oozing and bubbling, about 40 minutes.
