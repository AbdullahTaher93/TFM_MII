Heat the oil and butter in a large flameproof casserole over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, about 4 minutes, until translucent. Add the cinnamon, cardamom pods, and curry leaves, if using, and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, until fragrant. Add the curry powder, turmeric, and cumin, and stir for 1 minute. Add the chicken. Add the rice and raisins and stir well. Pour in enough stock to just cover the rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer about 15 minutes or until the rice is tender and has absorbed the stock, adding more stock if the mixture becomes dry. Transfer to a serving dish, fluffing the rice with a fork. Sprinkle with almonds and serve hot.
