Fry the sliced scallion in the oil for a minute, then add the curry paste. Whisk in the coconut milk, stock, and fish sauce and bring to a boil. Tip in the butternut squash and sweet potato cubes and simmer, partially covered, for about 15 minutes or until tender. Drain the shrimp under running water to remove excess ice and tumble them into the pan, letting the sauce come back to a boil. When it does, add the diced mango and lime juice and cook for another minute or so until the shrimp are cooked through. Sprinkle with the chopped cilantro as you serve over plain rice or wide rice noodles, or even both.
