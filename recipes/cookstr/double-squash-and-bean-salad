Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Cut all squash and zucchini into thirds then cut each third into batons or sticks. Arrange them in a large roasting pan and coat them well with the oil. Frankly, the best way to do this is to pour the oil over and then smoosh everything about in the pan with your hands. Stick the pan in the oven and roast the squash for about 30 minutes, by which time the batons should be cooked through and golden at the edges. While this is going on, cook the fava beans (and it truly is worth popping them out of their skins; see directions for the minestrone on page 26) and green beans separately in salted boiling water until tender, then drain and refresh them both by plunging them in iced water and then draining them again. When the squash batons are cool, put them in a bowl with the two beans and dress them with lemon juice; the squash should be sufficiently, and desirably, oily to need no extra drizzling here. Chop the basil and parsley and add them to the bowl, mixing everything gently (again, just hands is easiest) to avoid squashing the batons. Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper as needed, decant into a clean serving dish and sprinkle over whatever bits of basil and parsley are clinging to the chopping board.
