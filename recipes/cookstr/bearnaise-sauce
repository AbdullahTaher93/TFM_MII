Bring the shallots, 1 tbsp of the tarragon, vinegar, wine, and peppercorns to a boil in a heavy nonreactive saucepan over high heat. Boil for about 2 minutes, or until the mixture has reduced by half. Strain the liquid through a sieve and let cool. Whisk the egg yolks and 1 tbsp water in a heatproof bowl. Place over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Whisk in the cooled liquid. Whisk in the butter, 1 tbsp at a time, until the first addition softens into a creamy sauce before adding more. Whisk in the lemon juice and remaining tarragon. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
