Melt the butter with the olive oil in a chefâ€™s pan or wok over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and habanero, salt generously, and cook, stirring often, until everything softens, about 5 minutes. Add the rice, mix in thoroughly with a spatula, and cook for another 10 minutes or so, until a uniform mixture results. Put the eggs and lime juice into a small bowl, beat lightly with a fork, add it to the rice, and stir. Add the mango, mix, taste for salt, and serve in warmed bowls. Top with the lime zest and cilantro.
