Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 13 × 9-inch cake pan. In a nonreactive large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks until frothy. Add the sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest and continue beating until thick and fluffy. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Using a rubber spatula, fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Combine the matzoh meal, ground walnuts, and cinnamon. Fold them into the mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the top is golden and firm, 50 to 60 minutes.
