Preheat the oven to 375°F. Boil the potatoes until tender and squeeze the seeds from the tomatoes. Stick a large frying pan on a high heat, add a lug of olive oil and sear the lamb until golden. Remove and put to one side while you crush the drained potatoes in the frying pan – use the bottom of a jar or a masher – then fry for a couple of minutes over a low to medium heat. Stir the tomatoes, garlic, and olives into the potatoes with some seasoning and rosemary sprigs, drizzle with a little olive oil and place in a roasting pan. Place the lamb on top of the potatoes. Depending on the size of the racks, the lamb will take somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes to cook, but will still be pink in the middle (add 5 to 10 minutes if you like your meat well done). When the lamb is cooked to your liking, slice it into chops and serve with the crispy potatoes and a little salsa verde or an extra drizzle of olive oil.
