First make the stuffing: In a medium bowl mix the ground chicken with the pistachio nuts, egg yolk, thyme and parsley. Give it a jolly good seasoning with salt and pepper. Open out the chicken legs or thighs, season with pepper and divide the chicken stuffing between them. Shingle six pieces bacon rashers on a board. Put one stuffed chicken portion on top and wrap the bacon around to cover completely. Repeat with the rest of the chicken. Place in a large square of foil. Wrap each chicken in to a cylinder tightly in foil, twisting the ends to seal. Roll back and forth to even the shape. Poach the chicken parcels, two or three at a time, in a large pan of boiling water for 25-30 minutes, until the chicken is cooked. Let cool in the foil, then refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and pat dry to remove any excess moisture. In a medium pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and carefully saut√© the chicken parcels until the bacon is brown and crisp on all sides. Transfer to a warm platter and rest in a warm place 5 minutes. Slice and serve.
