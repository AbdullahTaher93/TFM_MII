Generously butter the loaf pans. Preheat the oven to 350°. In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. One at a time, add the eggs, mixing thoroughly. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients, alternately with the sour cream. Divide the batter between the loaf pans. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the loaves pull away from the sides of the pan. Allow the cakes to rest for 10 minutes, remove from the tins, and cool on a rack. Dust with confectioners’ sugar.
