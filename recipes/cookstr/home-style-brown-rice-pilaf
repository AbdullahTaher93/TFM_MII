In a saucepan, bring the water and salt to a boil, and add the rice. Bring the contents back to a boil, cover the pan, and turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the rice is tender. About 20 minutes before the rice is done, heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, and sauté, stirring frequently, until they soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and the carrots, and continue to sauté, stirring often, for 5 more minutes. Add the mushrooms, and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring often, until the mushrooms are beginning to brown. Add the chickpeas, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. When the rice is ready and you are ready to eat, pour the eggs into the skillet, and cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until the eggs are just set, about 2 minutes. Take the egg-mushroom mixture off the heat, and stir in the pepper, the parsley or cilantro, and the cashews or almonds. Add the cooked hot rice, and stir well. Serve the pilaf along with soy sauce for adding at the table.
