In a deep bowl, mix together the ginger, garlic, green chiles, garam masala, red chile powder, turmeric, 1 teaspoon of salt, cilantro, and mint. Add the lamb and mix to coat. Marinate at least 2 hours in the refrigerator or, ideally, overnight. After marinating, add the yogurt to the lamb and mix well. Turn the slow cooker on low. Add the onions, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of the oil, and the marinated lamb to the slow cooker. Cook for 2 hours. On the stovetop, bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the rice and the tablespoon of salt and turn the heat to low. Allow the rice to simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, at which point most of the water. Will have evaporated. If it has not, use a slotted spoon to transfer the rice to the slow cooker. Discard any remaining water. Level the rice in the slow cooker with the back of a spoon. Drizzle the rice with the remaining oil and the saffron/milk mixture, if desired. Cook for 1 hour, occasionally fluffing the rice with a fork. Scoop and serve this amazing one-pot meal. Try This! To add another layer of flavor to the dish, brown the onions in oil on the stovetop before adding them to the slow cooker.
