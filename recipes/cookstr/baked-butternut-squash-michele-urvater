Preheat the oven to 375°F. Scrub the squash, place it on a baking sheet, and prick it in a few places with a sharp knife. Bake until tender, about 1 hour. Remove the squash from the oven, split it in half (hold it in a towel), and scoop out the seeds. Season each half with some lime juice and salt and pepper to taste. Cut each half in half again and serve. Variations: • While the squash is baking, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small skillet over low heat. Stir in ½ teaspoon spice, such as ground cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, or cumin, and, if you like, 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Brush the butter mixture over each portion of squash before serving. • Or heat 2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil in a small skillet until hot, stir in ¼ cup minced herbs, like parsley or dill, and drizzle over each portion right before serving.
