Immerse the skewers before lighting the grill, so they have plenty of time to soak. Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill on medium-high. In a small bowl, combine the pesto and 2 tablespoons olive oil and mix well; set aside. Place the chicken breast tenders in a bowl, drizzle olive oil over the top, and brush or rub the chicken on both sides with the oil. Season generously with salt and pepper. Thread I chicken tender onto each skewer, unless there are small pieces to combine together. Weave the tenders so the skewers pierce each piece 2 or 3 times. Bunch the meat a bit, so it covers about 5 inches of the skewer. Oil the grill grate. Fold a footlong piece of aluminum foil in half lengthwise and lay it on the grill grate. Arrange the skewers so the exposed bamboo is protected from the flame by the foil and the meat is directly over the fire, Use 2 pieces of foil if necessary. Grill the chicken, turning once and basting frequently with the pesto oil, until the meat is nrm and the juices run clear when a tender is pierced with a knife, about 2Â½ minutes per side. Divide the skewers among warmed dinner plates. Serve immediately.
