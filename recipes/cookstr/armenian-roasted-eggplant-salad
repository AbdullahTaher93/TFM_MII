Peel the eggplant and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes. You should have about 6 cups. Cut off the stalks and base of the fennel bulb. Cut it in half, end-to-end, and remove the core if it is tough. Peel away any tough or discolored outer layers of the bulb. Chop the bulb into 1-inch pieces. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. In a large bowl, toss the eggplant, chopped fennel, bell peppers, and onions with the garlic, rosemary, olive oil, and ground fennel seeds. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Spread the vegetables evenly on two lightly oiled rimmed baking sheets. Bake for 15 minutes, and then turn the vegetables over with a spatula, and continue to bake until the eggplant and bell peppers are tender and lightly browned, up to 15 minutes. While the vegetables roast, in a large bowl, whisk together all of the dressing ingredients. Add the diced cucumber and celery. When the roasted vegetables come out of the oven, add them to the bowl and toss well. Serve at room temperature or chilled, garnished with parsley, crumbled feta, and/or olives.
