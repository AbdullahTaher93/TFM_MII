In a large saucepan of boiling lightly salted water, cook the peas for 1 minute, Drain. Using a food processor fitted with the metal blade, purée the peas and mint with ½ cup of the broth. Season with salt and pepper, and gradually add another cup of broth. Scrape the mixture into a medium saucepan, stir in the remaining 1½ cups broth, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. If serving hot, scald the heavy cream or milk. Whisk into the pea purée and simmer another 5 minutes. (If using the sour cream-milk combination, heat just until hot–do not simmer.) Add more liquid if you want a lighter soup. Taste for seasoning and serve. If serving cold, transfer the pea mixture to a large bowl, whisk in the remaining 1 cup of broth, and cool. Whisk in chilled cream or milk and refrigerate until cold.
