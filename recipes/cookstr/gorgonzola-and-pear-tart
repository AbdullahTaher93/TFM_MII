Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Coarsely chop the cheese and heat it in a small saucepan with the heavy cream over very low heat, stirring often. When the mixture is smooth, remove from the heat. Let cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Cut it into a 9-inch circle and fit into a 9-inch round tart or baking pan. Prick the surface of the pastry in a dozen or so places with a fork. Spoon half of the cheese mixture over the surface of the puff pastry. Arrange layers of the pear slices in 2 overlapping circles on top of it. Spoon the remaining cheese mixture evenly over the top of the pears. Bake for 30 minutes or until the top is golden. Let rest for 15 minutes. Cut in wedges and serve.
