Place a large cast-iron pan or soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil. Once hot, add the onions and cook for about 5 minutes, until translucent. Add the carrots, celery and sweet potato. Continue cooking for 5 minutes more. Add the cabbage, kale, Swiss chard and garlic. Stir well with a wooden spoon. Cover and continue cooking for 10 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and the diced tomatoes. Add the sage and bay leaves and stir. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Refrigerate overnight. Before serving, place over medium heat for 20 minutes or until hot. To serve, ladle the Ribollita into bowls and drizzle extra-virgin olive oil on top.
