In a small saucepan, bring the sugar and water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and let it boil for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the mint. When the syrup has cooled, transfer it to a container, cover, and place in the refrigerator. Allow the mixture to steep for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight. Before serving, strain the mixture and discard the mint. Variations: For basil syrup, substitute Â½ cup of fresh basil leaves for the mint. For lavender syrup, use 1 tablespoon of dried lavender. Prepare the syrup as above.
