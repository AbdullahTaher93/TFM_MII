In a large saucepan over high heat, bring the water to a boil. Squeeze in the juice of the lime and then add the squeezed lime to the water, along with the salt. When the water comes back to a boil, add the shrimp in their shells. Cover the saucepan with a lid and remove it from the heat. Let the shrimp sit in the covered pan for 3 minutes. They will cook perfectly. When they are opaque, drain them and plunge them into an ice bath to stop the cooking. Peel the shrimp when they are cool enough to handle, and keep them in the refrigerator until ready to assemble. Add the whole tomatoes and their juice to a food processor work bowl and process to a smooth sauce consistency, about 10 seconds. Pour into a large bowl and add the lime juice, celery, vodka, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, Tabasco, salt, and pepper. Taste the sauce for seasoning and add more of whatever you like, if desired. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to let the flavors develop. To assemble, toss the chilled shrimp with the sauce. Add the cilantro, if using. Arrange the shrimp and sauce in large martini or margarita glasses, and garnish with the celery stalks. Serve cold.
