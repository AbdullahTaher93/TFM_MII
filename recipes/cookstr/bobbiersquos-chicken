Preheat oven to 425°F. Rinse the chicken and pat dry. Squeeze the juice of the lemon all over the chicken and in the cavity. Rub the chicken all over with the mustard, ginger, and salt and pepper to taste. Place in a metal roasting pan and scatter 4 of the onions in the pan. Roast undisturbed for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, simmer the giblets, the remaining 2 onions, the bouillon powder, and 2 cups of the water in a small saucepan over medium heat for 25 to 30 minutes. Set aside. Reduce the oven heat to 375°F and pour the remaining 2 cup water into the pan. Roast the chicken 30 minutes more, basting occasionally with the pan juices. Strain the giblet stock and pour ¾ cup of the stock into the roasting pan. Roast, basting occasionally, for 30 minutes more. Remove the chicken from the oven and cut into serving pieces with a knife and fork (the chicken should be falling off the bone). Mix the chicken with the onions and juices in the pan and pour in the remaining giblet stock. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes. Serve on a large platter surrounded by the juices.
