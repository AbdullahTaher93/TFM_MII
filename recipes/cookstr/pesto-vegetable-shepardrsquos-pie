PREP: Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks. Cut zucchini in half lengthwise, then into half-moons. Cut out and discard seeds and ribs from red pepper; cut into ½-inch dice. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Place potatoes in large saucepan and add enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return to pot. Add sour cream and mash with potato masher or handheld electric mixer. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons butter in very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and red pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes. Stir in corn and pesto. Season with salt and pepper. Spread vegetables in baking dish. Spread with mashed potatoes and sprinkle with cheese. Cut remaining 1 tablespoon butter into small cubes and sprinkle over potatoes. Bake until topping is tinged with brown and cheese melts, about 20 minutes. Serve hot. Variation Add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves to the skillet with the zucchini and red pepper.
