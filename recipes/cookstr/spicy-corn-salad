Melt the butter with the olive oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add the red onion, habanero, and bell pepper. Salt liberally and saut√© for 3 minutes, until everything softens. Add the corn kernels and cook for another 3 minutes. The corn should be hot but not browned. Turn off the heat. Add the vinegar, maple syrup, and lime zest and juice and stir. Taste for salt and transfer to a warm serving bowl. Top with the chives and cilantro.
