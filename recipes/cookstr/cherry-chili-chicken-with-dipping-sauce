Put the raisins in a small bowl and pour the juice from the canned cherries over them. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Scatter the onion slices over the bottom of a large baking pan or roasting pan. Set the pan aside. Season the chicken with garlic powder, paprika, and salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it is quite hot but not smoking. Add the chicken, in batches, and cook until browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side, adding the remaining oil 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed. As the chicken pieces brown, arrange them, skin side up, on top of the onions in the baking pan. Remove the skillet from the heat and discard all the oil. Add ½ cup of the sherry to the skillet and scrape up all the brown bits. Stir in the chili sauce, brown sugar, ¼ cup water, and the plumped raisins with the cherry juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then pour it over the chicken. Roast, uncovered, basting occasionally, for 25 minutes. Pour the remaining ½ cup sherry around the chicken, distribute the cherries throughout the pan, and baste. Roast, basting occasionally, until cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a warm serving platter and cover to keep warm. Strain the liquid into a medium-size saucepan, reserving the solids. Bring the strained sauce to a boil over medium-high heat and boil until reduced by about one third, or until thick, 8 to 10 minutes (longer if you like a thicker sauce). Spoon the onions, cherries, and raisins over the chicken, and pass the sauce.
