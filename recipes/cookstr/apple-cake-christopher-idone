Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Butter the baking dish. Roughly chop the apples. Reserving 1 cup, place the apples in a large pot with 1/2 cup water. Simmer over moderately low heat until the apples begin to soften but do not turn to sauce. The mixture should be very chunky. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. One at a time, add the eggs. Sift together the dry ingredients and incorporate. Fold in the apple mixture with a rubber spatula. Turn the batter into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the reserved 1 cup apples over the dough and pat down with a spatula. Bake for 1 hour, or until golden brown. Serve warm with unsweetened whipped cream. Turn the batter into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the reserved 1 cup apples over the dough and pat down with a spatula.
