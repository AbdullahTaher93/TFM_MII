Wash the quinoa thoroughly to remove any trace of the bitter white coating, then rinse and drain. Bring the water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan. Add salt and the quinoa. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until all the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Blot the quinoa with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Place the quinoa in a large serving bowl and set aside to cool. Add the tomatoes, onion, the adzuki beans, if using, parsley, and cilantro. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper until blended. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. For the best flavor, this salad should be served the day it is made. Serve chilled.
