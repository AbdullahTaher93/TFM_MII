Set the potatoes and garlic in a medium pot, cover with at least 2 inches of water, and add 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook with the lid slightly askew until the potatoes are completely softened, about 15 minutes (test by poking with a wooden skewer or a paring knife). Drain well and return the potatoes to the pot. Meanwhile, heat the milk and butter over medium-low heat until the butter is melted. Add the milk mixture to the drained potatoes and mash thoroughly with a masher or a whisk until smooth. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk if the potatoes are dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve, or use in Mashed Potatoes with Cheddar, Chiles and Scallions.
