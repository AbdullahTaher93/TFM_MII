Place the tuna, mustard, basil, garlic, ginger and pepper in a large mixing bowl and toss gently to combine. Place the flour and salt on a large plate. Divide the tuna mixture into 4 patties and dredge them in the mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and when it is hot, add the oil. Add the patties and cook until rare on the inside and well browned on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Serve immediately, garnished with the lime quarters and red onion rings and greens, if desired.
