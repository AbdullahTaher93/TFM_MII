In a skillet warm 3 tbsp (45 mL) vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté for 4 to 5 minutes or until softened and fragrant. Reduce heat to low. Add turmeric and garam masala; sauté for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in vinegar, jam and remaining vegetable oil. Set aside. Thread chicken and apricots, alternately, onto skewers (if using wooden skewers, soak in water for 1 hour beforehand). Place skewers in baking dish. Cover with spice mixture, turning to coat well. Cover with plastic wrap. Marinate in refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours. Remove skewers from refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Transfer chicken to a platter. Pour any remaining marinade into a small saucepan; boil for 5 minutes. Preheat grill to medium-high. Grill chicken for 10 to 15 minutes, turning and basting with reserved marinade. Serve immediately.
