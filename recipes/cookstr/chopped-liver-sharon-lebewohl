Turn on broiler. Rinse beef and chicken livers thoroughly, and cut away membranes and extra fat. Cut beef liver into 1-inch pieces; chicken livers can remain whole. Place beef and chicken livers in a large baking pan, and drizzle with corn oil (pour oil into a flatware tablespoon and drizzle over livers; 2 tablespoons are ample). Broil 8 to 10 minutes (keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t burn). Turn liver pieces, and broil for another 5 minutes. Liver should be fully cooked and lightly browned on both sides. Let chill in refrigerator. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons corn oil and the same amount of schmaltz, and sauté onions, stirring occasionally, until well browned. Let chill in refrigerator. In food processor, combine liver, onions, hard-boiled eggs, schmaltz, salt, and pepper, and blend until smooth. You’ll have to do it in batches. Chill before serving.
