Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Cut cauliflower into bite-size florets. Put the cauliflower and shallot in a large bowl. Sprinkle with cumin. Add the olive oil and toss together. Make sure all pieces are coated with oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Spread the vegetables out on the prepared baking sheet. Roast about 15 minutes or until the cauliflower is fully cooked but still has a slight crunch in the bite. Transfer to a serving bowl and splash with a little vinegar.
