Thoroughly wash the leaves of the Napa cabbages and cut them into about 2-inch lengths. Peel the Asian radish and halve it lengthwise down the center, cut lengthwise again, and then slice into Â½-inch thin squares. Dissolve the salt in 1 cup water. Place the vegetables in a large bowl and pour the salt water over them. Let soak at least 6 hours or preferably overnight. The next day, drain the vegetables and retain the salty water. Add the green onions, garlic, ginger, and chili powder. Mix the vegetables by hand (use gloves because the chili may sting and stain your hands). Pack into a 1-gallon jar. Pour the salted water over the mixture. Leave about an inch of space on top of the jar. Let sit about 2 or 3 days, depending on how warm the weather is and how fermented you like your kimchi. Refrigerate after opening.
