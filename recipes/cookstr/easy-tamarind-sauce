Place all the ingredients in a large soup pot and mix well. Bring to boil over medium-high heat and let boil for 10 minutes, stirring often. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce has cooked down to a consistency that resembles prune butter, 2Â½ to 3 hours (remember to stir occasionally, making sure that the sauce does not burn). Remove from the heat, allow to cool fully, and store in a jar in the refrigerator for several months.
