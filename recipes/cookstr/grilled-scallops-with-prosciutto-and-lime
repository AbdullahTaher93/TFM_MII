Trim the small white muscle from the side of each scallop. Place 3 scallops in each of 6 scallop shells or ramekins. Season with salt and pepper. Cut 1 lime into 6 wedges and set aside. Combine the butter, the juice of the remaining lime, the garlic, and basil. Divide evenly among the scallops. Sprinkle with the prosciutto strips. Preheat the broiler. Broil the scallops in the shells for about 5 minutes, until they turn opaque. Sprinkle with additional herbs. Serve immediately with the lime wedges.
