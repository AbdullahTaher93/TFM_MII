For The Dressing: Whisk the oil, lime juice, and pepper sauce in a small bowl to blend. Season the dressing to taste with fleur de sel and pepper. For the Toast: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Brush the bread slices with the oil; arrange the bread on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with fleur de sel and pepper. Bake until the bread is toasted and beginning to color, about 8 minutes. For The Carpaccio: Meanwhile, place one 4-inch ring mold with ¾-inch-high sides in the center of each of 6 plates. Layer the sliced fish inside the molds, brushing each layer of the fish with the dressing. Top with the beets and broccoli. Carefully remove the ring molds. Garnish the carpaccio with the thyme and serve with the toast.
