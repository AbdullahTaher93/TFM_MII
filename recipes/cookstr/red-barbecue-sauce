Place all the ingredients in a saucepan and stir to mix well. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes to blend the flavors. Remove the sauce from the heat. The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
