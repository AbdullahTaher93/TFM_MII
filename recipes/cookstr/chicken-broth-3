Rinse the chicken pieces well, removing all excess fat. Place the chicken in a large soup pot, and add all the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer gently, partially covered, for 1Â½ hours, carefully skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Adjust the seasonings and cook 30 minutes longer. Remove the pot from the heat, and let the broth cool slightly. Strain the broth through a sieve into a bowl, then line the sieve with a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth and pour through again. Cool to room temperature. If the broth is to be used immediately, allow the fat to rise to the surface; then degrease the broth completely by skimming off the fat with a metal spoon or by pouring the broth through a gravy separator. If it is not for immediate use, transfer the cooled broth to a storage container and refrigerate it, covered, for 4 hours or overnight. Remove the hardened layer of fat from the top before using. Use the defatted broth within 4 days, or transfer it to freezer containers and freeze it for up to 3 months.
