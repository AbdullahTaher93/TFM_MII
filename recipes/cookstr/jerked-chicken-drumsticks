Place the chile, green onions, vinegar, brown sugar, oil, soy sauce, rum (if using), lime juice, jerk seasoning, and salt in a food processor; puree until smooth. Spray the inside of the crock with nonstick cooking spray. Place the drumsticks in the slow cooker, laying them side by side. Pour the seasoning paste over the chicken and turn to coat the pieces, using a small spatula. Add the bell pepper strips. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 7 hours (or on HIGH for 3 to 4 hours), until the chicken is cooked through. Serve hot.
