If you don’t have cooked potatoes on hand, cut up two large potatoes, unpeeled, and boil them in salted water for about 20 minutes until soft. Mash and reserve. Place the fish in a steamer and top with the diced onion and seasonings. Cover and steam for about 10 to 15 minutes or until the onion is cooked. In a medium-size bowl, combine the cooked fish and seasoned onions with the mashed potatoes. Mix in the egg and cream and form into 4 patties. Sauté the fishcakes in butter until browned.
