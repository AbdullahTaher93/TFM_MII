In a bowl, mix together chickpea flour, salt, cayenne pepper and baking soda. Slowly pour in 1 cup (250 ml) water, stirring to a smooth consistency and adding up to ¼ cup (50 ml) more water, a little at a time, until batter is slightly thinner than pancake batter. Set aside for 15 minutes. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375°F (190°C). One at a time, dip slices of eggplant, pepper, zucchini and potato into batter. Add to hot oil in batches of 5 or 6 and deep-fry until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with chutney of your choice.
