Chiffonade the kale and place it into a mixing bowl with the lemon juice and sea salt. Massage well with your hands, working the lemon juice and salt into the greens until softened. Add the tomatoes, pine nuts, cranberries, olive oil, and flax oil and toss gently. Season to taste with pepper. The salad will keep for 3 days in the refrigerator.
