Put the breadcrumbs in a small frying pan over medium-high heat, drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and re-toast, stirring often, until crunchy. Set them aside on a paper towel. Boil the pasta in salted water for 2 minutes less than the package directs. Drain. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan over very low heat, slowly heat 1/4 cup (60 ml) oil with the anchovies, pressing the anchovies with a wooden spoon until they dissolve. Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half. Add the tomato paste and dates and simmer for a few minutes. Toss the pasta in the sauce to finish cooking it, adding a little cooking liquid as needed. Serve the pasta topped with the breadcrumbs and long strips of orange zest. Region: Northern and central Italy
