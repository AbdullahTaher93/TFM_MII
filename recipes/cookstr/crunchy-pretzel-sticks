Sift the whole-wheat flour, bread flour, and barley flour together and set aside. Warm ½ cup of the water to 115°F. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the warm water, yeast, sugar, and brown rice syrup. Mix well on low speed and let stand for 5 minutes. Add the salt and half of the flour mixture and mix on low speed to create a loose dough, about 1 to 2 minutes. Switch to the dough hook and, with the mixer on low speed, add the remaining flour mixture a little at a time until the dough comes together into a ball. Increase the mixer speed to high and knead for 3 minutes. Punch down the dough and continue to knead on medium-low speed for another 2 minutes, until the dough is smooth and not sticky. If the dough is very sticky, add a bit more bread flour. Cover the dough and let it proof for 1 hour in a warm spot. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and set aside. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Keep the dough you aren’t working with covered. Working with one piece at a time, pinch off tablespoon-sized pieces of dough and roll into long 1/4-inch-thick logs. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining dough. In a small bowl, whisk the egg whites with the baking soda and remaining 1 tablespoon water. Brush each pretzel generously with the egg wash and sprinkle with the coarse salt. Bake until the pretzels are a deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes, rotating the baking sheets every 5 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, and serve long or break into smaller sticks.
