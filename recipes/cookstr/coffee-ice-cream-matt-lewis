To Make the Coffee Ice Cream: Put the egg yolks in a large heatproof bowl and set aside. In a medium saucepan, stir together the heavy cream, milk, sugar, salt and instant espresso powder. Bring the mixture to a slow, consistent simmer (just this side of a boil) and remove from heat. Whisk the egg yolks until just combined, then slowly stream in half of the hot coffee cream mixture while whisking constantly. Transfer the egg mixture back to the medium saucepan containing the other half of the coffee cream mixture. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the hack of a spoon (about 175 degrees on an instant-read thermometer). Remove from heat and strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Whisk in the Kahlua, and let mixture cool to room temperature. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for 4 hours. Pour into an ice cream machine and freeze, following the manufacturerâ€™s directions.
