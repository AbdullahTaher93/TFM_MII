Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In a mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment, combine oats, flour, brown sugar and baking powder. Stir on low speed for 30 seconds until blended. With mixer running, add butter, a few pieces at a time, and mix until crumbly, about 3 minutes. Press two-thirds of the crumb mixture into prepared baking pan. Smooth preserves over crumb base. Sprinkle with remaining crumb mixture. Bake in preheated oven until light brown and preserves are bubbling, 18 to 24 minutes. Let cool completely in baking pan before cutting into bars.
