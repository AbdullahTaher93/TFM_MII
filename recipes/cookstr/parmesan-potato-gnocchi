Put the unpeeled potatoes in a medium-size saucepan and cover with plenty of salted water. Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat and gently boil the potatoes until they’re tender at the center, 30 to 40 minutes; poke them with a cake tester to check. Drain. Let the potatoes cool briefly. As soon as you can, peel off the potato skins, then put the potatoes through a ricer or food mill, letting the flesh fall into a large bowl. Add the flour, cheese, salt, and a good measure of pepper, tossing gently to mix. Make a well in the center of the potatoes. Add the egg to the well, whisk briefly, then mix the dough with your hands until it pulls together into a uniform mass. Shake a little flour onto your work surface and knead the dough 5 or 6 times. With floured hands, roll the dough into a rope about 1½ inches in diameter. (It might be easiest to do this part in sections.) Cut the dough into 1-inch segments, then roll each one gently on the counter—crosswise, not the same direction you’ve, just rolled it—into little torpedos about 2 inches long. Transfer to a baking sheet as you cut them. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until using, no longer than 1 hour.
