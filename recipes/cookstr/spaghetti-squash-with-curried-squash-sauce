Cut the spaghetti squash in half and scrape out the seeds. Place the squash skin side up in a large saucepan, cover by 2 inches with water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. While the spaghetti squash is cooking, prepare the curried squash: Melt the butter in a skillet, and add the curry powder and yellow squash. Saut√© over medium heat until cooked, about 10 to 15 minutes. Pass the mixture through a food mill into a warmed bowl. Add the chives, and keep warm. Using a fork, scoop out the center of the spaghetti squash; it will form spaghetti-like strands. Top it with the curried squash, sprinkle with the Parmesan, and serve immediately.
