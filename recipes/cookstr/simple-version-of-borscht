MELT the butter in a 4-quart pot over medium heat. Add the vegetables and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the vegetables soften. (If youâ€™re using canned beets, add them after the other vegetables have softened.) ADD the beef broth and bring the soup to a simmer. Simmer slowly for 10 minutes. Reach in with a spoon and sample a few of the vegetables to make sure they have softened thoroughly. SPRINKLE in the wine vinegar to taste. Season with salt and pepper. SERVE in hot bowls. Pass the sour cream, chopped dill, and sliced black bread at the table. SUGGESTIONS AND VARIATIONS SUGGESTIONS AND VARIATIONS
