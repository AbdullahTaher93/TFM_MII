To prepare the sauce, in a small bowl combine the bell pepper, oil, vinegar, lemon juice, shallots, pepper flakes, salt, and honey. Let sit for 1 hour at room temperature to let the flavors mingle. Just before serving, add the parsley and mint. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Heat a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and swirl around the pan to evenly coat. Sprinkle the lamb chops with salt and pepper. When the pan is hot, add the chops. Sear for 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to the oven and finish cooking for 10 minutes. If you are using individual rib chops, sear for 3 minutes on each side, place in the oven for 5 minutes to finish cooking, and serve right from the skillet.
