Cut the tomatoes into ¼-inch dice and place in a bowl. Toss with the minced garlic and shallots. Chop the basil coarsely and add to the tomatoes, along with the lemon juice, salt and pepper, and 1/3 cup olive oil. Set aside. Heat the ¼ cup olive oil in a small skillet. Sauté the slivered garlic until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Discard the garlic and reserve the oil. Toast the bread and cut each slice in half. Arrange the slices on eight small plates. Brush the garlic-flavored oil over each slice, spoon the tomato mixture over the bread, and serve immediately. The mixture should be at room temperature.
