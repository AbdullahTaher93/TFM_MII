Heat the oil and butter in a large flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and bacon and cook, stirring often, until the shallots begin to brown. Add the venison and cook, stirring, for about 4 minutes, or until evenly colored. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes, until beginning to brown. Add the brandy and stir for 30 seconds, then add the stock and mushrooms. Bring to a boil, stirring. Stir in the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, and oregano, and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer the ragout for 45 minutes–1½ hours, or until the venison is tender (the cooking time will depend on the cut of meat - loin takes less time than shoulder). Serve hot.
