Heat the oil in a 5-quart Dutch oven or soup kettle. In batches, add the meat and cook over medium-high heat, turning often, until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch. Set the browned meat aside. Add the onions and garlic to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Then stir in the broth, tomato paste, chives, salt, pepper, and cloves. Return the meat to the pot and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, until the meat is tender, about 1Â½ hours. Serve immediately.
