Combine the lemon juice or vinegar and flour in a bowl. Stir in the egg yolks, the spices and salt, the molasses and nuts. Spread the butter on the unbaked pastry shell and add the filling. Bake 10 to 12 minutes at 450 degrees, reduce the heat to 325 degrees, and continue baking about 35 minutes longer, or until almost firm. Remove and cool on a rack. When the pie is cool, make a meringue using 4 egg whites beaten until they hold soft peaks, then the sugar gradually added, a tablespoon at a time. Beat until the sugar is dissolved and the meringue stiff and glossy. Spread this over the pie, being certain to cover the edges. Place in a 350-degree oven to brown lightly. Serve cooled.
