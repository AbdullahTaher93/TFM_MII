To prepare the shrimp: In a large bowl, mix together the lime juice, peanut oil, cumin, and salt. Set aside. Put the shrimp in a glass dish and pour the lime juice mixture over the shrimp, being sure to coat both sides. Let sit for 30 minutes at room temperature. Preheat a gas grill to medium high. Alternatively, set a rack in the broiler about six inches below the heating element and preheat. To make the quinoa: In a medium pot, bring the stock to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the quinoa and salt. Cover and let cook for 10 minutes. Add the beans, corn, jalape√±o, orange zest, and cumin and cook for 10 more minutes, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Turn off the heat and leave the pot covered. (Note: The quinoa can be made 1 day ahead up to this point and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature and add the mango and cilantro just before serving.) To grill the shrimp: Place the shrimp on the grill. Cook for 2 minutes. Turn the shrimp and cook for 1 to 2 more minutes, or until they are just pink and feel firm but not hard to the touch. Overcooking will make the shrimp tough and dry. To broil the shrimp: Transfer the shrimp to a broiler pan. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shrimp have turned light pink and feel firm but a tad springy to the touch. Overcooking will make the shrimp tough and dry. (Note: No need to turn the shrimp.) To assemble: Gently mix the mango and cilantro into the quinoa. Transfer to individual plates or a large platter. Lay the shrimp on top, and sprinkle the cheese over the shrimp and quinoa. Garnish with cilantro and serve.
