Preheat the grill, if using. Add salt and pepper to the ground beef and mix well. Shape into 4 patties, making sure the edges are uniformly thick and smooth. If pan-searing, heat a heavy, well-seasoned skillet. Add the burgers to the hot grill or skillet and cook for 5 to 6 minutes per side, to the desired doneness. If desired, toast the buns on the grill or in the skillet 2 to 3 minutes before the burgers are done. Top the burgers with the green chile about a minute before they are done. Place the burgers on the bottom half of the buns. Add toppings as desired.
