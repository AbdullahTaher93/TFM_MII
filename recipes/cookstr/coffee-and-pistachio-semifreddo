Lightly oil an 8 in (20cm) square metal cake pan and line it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into a saucepan. Add the sugar and ½ cup water. Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Boil without stirring about 3 minutes, until syrupy. Dissolve the coffee granules in the boiling water, and stir into the syrup. Beat the egg yolks and Marsala in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in the coffee syrup in a steady stream, and beat about 6 minutes, until thick and tripled in volume. Whip the cream in a chilled bowl until soft peaks form. Fold into the egg mixture with the yogurt and ¾ cup of the pistachios. Spread the cake pan and sprinkle with the remaining pistachios. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 4–5 hours, until firm. Invert the pan to unmold the semifreddo onto a chilled platter, remove the plastic wrap, and turn right side up. Cut into squares with a knife dipped in hot water. Serve immediately on chilled dessert plates, sprinkled with more pistachio nuts and rose petals, if using.
