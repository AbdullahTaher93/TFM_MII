In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the water to a boil, stir in the Thai tea powder, and remove from heat. Stir well to mix in the sugar and then let it cool, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. When the tea has cooled to room temperature, strain it through a finemesh strainer or coffee filter into a pitcher and chill until serving time. To serve, fill 4 to 6 tall glasseswith ice and then add about Â¾ cup Thai tea to each glass. Top off each glass with 3 to 4 tablespoons evaporated milk. Serve at once, as the evaporated milk cascades over the ice and swirls languidly into the tea.
