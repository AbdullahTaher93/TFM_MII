Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. In a small saucepan, cook the honey, brown sugar, and vanilla over medium heat until the sugar melts, stirring occasionally. In a medium bowl, combine the oats, sunflower seeds, almonds, coconut, and walnuts. Add the sugar mixture and toss until the granola is evenly coated. Lightly grease a baking sheet with the spray or butter and spread out the mixture in an even layer. Bake for 25 minutes, stirring the mixture once or twice during baking. Remove the granola from the oven, and let it cool to room temperature in the pan. Break the granola into chunks and store in a plastic bag or container.
