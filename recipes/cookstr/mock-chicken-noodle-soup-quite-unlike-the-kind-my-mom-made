Heat the oil in a large soup pot. Add the celery, carrots, garlic, onion, and about 2 tablespoons water. Cover and sweat over medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Add the water with bouillon cubes, seasoning, and dried dill. Bring to a rapid simmer. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer gently for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Raise the heat and bring to a more vigorous simmer. Add the noodles and simmer steadily for 5 to 8 minutes, or until all dente. Stir in the diced tofu, then season with salt and pepper. Serve at once. As the soup stands, the noodles quickly absorb the liquid. If you plan on having leftovers of the soup, add a cup or so of additional water before storing, and adjust the seasonings. This way the soup can develop more flavor as it stands.
