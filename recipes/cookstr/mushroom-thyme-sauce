Heat the olive oil in a heavy 3-quart saucepan. Add the onion, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper and sweat until juicy, about 5 minutes. Raise the heat a bit and saut√© until the veggies begin to brown. Add the wine and reduce by half. Add the stock and reduce again by half, add the cream and reduce until the sauce thickens and becomes slightly shiny about 5 minutes. Strain the sauce into a clean saucepan, pressing very well on the solids to work out all the liquid. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and a little salt and pepper and cover to sweat for a minute or two. Uncover and add about 2 tablespoons of thyme leaves. Chop the sage leaves and add. Cook over medium heat until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add the mushrooms to the sauce, along with a touch of lemon juice. Taste and add more if you like, plus more salt and pepper if needed.
