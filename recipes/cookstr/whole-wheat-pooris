Mix the water with 2 tsp oil, onion seeds, salt, cumin, and sugar in a bowl. Stir in flour to make a stiff dough. Knead on a floured work surface for 5 minutes, or until smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap and let stand for 45 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 equal balls. On an unfloured work surface, flatten and roll out each ball into a 5in (12.5cm) round. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand while heating the oil. Pour enough oil into a large deep saucepan to come halfway up the sides and heat the oil over high heat to 350°F (180°C). One at a time, deep-fry the dough rounds for about 2 minutes, turning once, until puffed up and golden. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve hot.
