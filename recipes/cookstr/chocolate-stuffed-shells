Boil the shells in lightly salted water until they are al dente and drain. For sweeter shells, put the cocoa powder and confectioners' sugar, to taste, into a sturdy plastic food -storage bag. Toss the shells, a few at a time, into the bag until fully coated with cocoa powder. For less sweet shells, toss them in just the cocoa powder. Using a teaspoon, fill the shells with anything you like. A few fun options: --Ice cream + banana slices + dollop of fudge sauce+ chopped nuts= mini sundae --Ricotta + sugar + mini chocolate chips = soft cannoli --Macarpone cheese + sugar + drop of coffee = instant tiramisu --Cream cheese + fruit jam + fresh fruit = Italian-style cheese cake
