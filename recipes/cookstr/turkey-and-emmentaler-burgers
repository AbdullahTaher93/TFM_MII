Preheat the broiler, placing the rack 6 inches below the heating element, or set an outdoor grill to medium. Butter the English muffins and broil or grill until the butter has melted and the muffins are toasted. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the turkey, egg, mustard, onions, salt, and pepper and mix lightly. Form the mixture into 4 patties about Â¾ inch thick (they will be a little sticky. To help form the patties, handle as little as possible and wet your hands in between forming each patty). To broil: Lightly oil a broiler pan. Put the burgers on the pan and broil for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the burgers are light brown and feel firm but still slightly springy to the touch. Turn, place 2 slices of cheese (or one-quarter of the grated cheese) on each burger, and cook 3 to 4 minutes more, or until the burgers feel firm but still give just a little when pressed (for medium). Cook about 2 minutes longer for well-done. To grill: Place the burgers on the grill, cover, and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until the undersides are brown but not dark. Turn burgers, place 2 slices of cheese (or one-quarter of the grated cheese) on each burger, cover, and cook 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the burgers feel firm but still give slightly when pressed for medium rare. Cook about 2 minutes longer for medium or well-done. Serve with sliced tomatoes and extra Dijon on the side.
