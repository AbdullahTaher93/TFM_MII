Combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water in a small bowl; set aside until foamy, 5 to 15 minutes. (If the yeast doesn’t bubble up, discard the mixture and start again with fresh ingredients.) In a large bowl, combine the chick-pea flour and salt and add the yeast mixture. Gradually sprinkle in cold water 1 tablespoon at a time to make a soft dough that easily pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Knead the bread for 10 minutes on a lightly floured work surface. Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and set aside to rise in a warm place until doubled, 1 hour. Place 2 baking sheets in the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Divide the dough into 4 balls. Roll out each ball on a lightly floured surface into an 18-inch long oblong, between ¼ and ½ inch thick. Divide the cumin seeds among the 4 breads. When the baking sheets are very hot, remove, sprinkle each lightly with chick-pea flour, and place 1 loaf on each tray. Bake each bread until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with the remaining 2 loaves. Serve warm or at room temperature.
