To make the ranchero sauce: Heat the oil in a medium-size pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and saute until translucent and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, beans, jalapenos, chipotle, and adobo. Stir to mix. Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and using an immersion blender, pulse the mixture several times until pasty, but still chunky-like really chunky refried beans. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside, but keep warm. To make the tofuevos: Crumble the tofu and combine with the nutritional yeast, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, turmeric, and pepper in a bowl. Use your hands to make sure everything gets mashed together. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the tofu mixture and panfry until heated through and just beginning to brown. Transfer back to the bowl and keep warm while you heat the tortillas. Using the same pan, melt 1 teaspoon of butter over medium heat. Lightly panfry a tortilla on both sides until warm and soft. Transfer to a plate and cover lightly with a kitchen towel to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 3 tortillas. On each plate, divide the Tofuevos evenly on top of each tortilla, then pour the ranchero sauce on top of the tofuevos. Top with the sour cream, avocado, and scallion, and serve.
