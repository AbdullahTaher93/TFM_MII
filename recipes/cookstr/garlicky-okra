Rinse okra and pat dry. Cut into ½-inch (1 cm) pieces. Set aside. In a skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic and asafetida and sauté until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add onions and sauté until golden, 7 to 8 minutes. Add chiles and sauté for 2 minutes. Add kokum, if using, and sauté for 1 minute. Add okra and mix well. Sauté, stirring frequently, until there is no more sliminess, 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust heat to prevent burning but maintain a gentle sizzle at all times. If okra is not completely cooked, add 1 tbsp (15 mL) water. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until tender. Shake pan periodically to prevent burning. Remove from heat, sprinkle with salt and mix. Sprinkle mango powder over top. Serve as a side dish.
