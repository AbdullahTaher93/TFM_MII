Peel and thinly slice the onions by hand or in a food processor. Put in the slow cooker and toss with the olive oil. Cover and cook on LOW for 3 to 4 hours, stir, and continue cooking several hours, until the onions are well cooked and caramelized. Total cooking time will be 8 to 10 hours. When the onions are done, add both the broths and Marsala, if using; add no water or salt. Cover and cook on HIGH until hot, 15 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Put the bread slices on a baking sheet and brush with olive oil or leave plain. Bake until golden brown around the edges, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Ladle the soup into individual ovenproof soup bowls and place on a baking sheet to prevent the bowls from tipping over. Top each bowl full of soup with a toasted bread slice and cover with a slice of the Gruyere. Adjust the oven rack to comfortably fit the bowls under the broiler with at least 4 inches to spare. Turn on the broiler and slide the soups under the flame; broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
