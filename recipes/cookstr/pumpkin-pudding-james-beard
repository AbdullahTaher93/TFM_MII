If fresh pumpkin is used, force the pulp through a fine sieve or purée it in an electric blender. Canned pumpkin is generally in purée form. In a mixing bowl beat the eggs, sugar, and salt together until the mixture is very thick. Stir into it the pumpkin, applejack, and spices, and lightly but thoroughly fold in the whipped cream. Transfer the mixture to a buttered 2-quart baking dish and bake it at 350 degrees 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center can be withdrawn clean. Serve the pudding warm or cooled with slightly sweetened whipped cream flavored with applejack.
