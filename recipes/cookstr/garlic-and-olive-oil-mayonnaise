Combine the garlic cloves with the coarse salt in a mortar and pestle and work the mixture to a smooth paste; then add the egg yolks and the lemon juice or vinegar and slowly work in the olive oil. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, make the mayonnaise in a bowl: chop the garlic and crush it on the cutting board with the side of a chef's knife, put it in a bowl with the egg yolks, lemon juice or vinegar, and slowly stir in the olive oil with a wooden spoon. If the mayonnaise starts to thicken so much that it's difficult to work, thin it with a tablespoon of water. Variations
