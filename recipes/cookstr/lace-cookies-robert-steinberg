Position the racks in the lower and upper thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F. Line two baking sheets with Silpats or parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and oats. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the butter, cream, corn syrup, vanilla, and rum. Stir until smooth. Slowly add the dry ingredients, stirring to combine. Drop about ¾ of a teaspoon of the batter onto the prepared baking sheets. Make the cookies as close in size as possible. Place only 12 cookies on each baking sheet (four rows of three), as they will spread considerably. Bake the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes, rotating once halfway through baking. Remove from the oven and let stand on the sheets for 1 to 2 minutes. If any of the cookies have run together, cut them apart, then transfer the cookies to cooling racks to cool completely. Choose 2 cookies that are similar in shape. Drizzle the bottom of one cookie with melted chocolate and spread with a small offset spatula. Sandwich with the second cookie. Repeat with remaining cookies.
