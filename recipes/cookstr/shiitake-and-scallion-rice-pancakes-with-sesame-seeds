Heat the oil in a large wide saucepan or deep skillet. Add the shiitakes; cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the scallion whites and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Stir in the rice; cook, stirring, until blended. Add the rice vinegar and cook, stirring, until it has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the chicken broth to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Stir 2 cups of the hot chicken broth into the rice. Cover and cook over low heat for 10 minutes. Add ½ cup more broth; stir for 30 seconds. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add the remaining ½ cup chicken broth; stir for 30 seconds. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add the scallion greens, sesame seeds, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Stir until well blended. Add salt to taste and a grinding of black pepper. Spread the rice in a 13 × 9-inch baking pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the rice. Refrigerate until cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes. Using a small knife, cut the rice into 12 squares. Dampen your hands with water and shape each portion into a 2½-inch pancake about ½ inch thick. Rinse your hands frequently to prevent sticking. Refrigerate the pancakes, covered, for at least 20 minutes. When ready to serve, heat a thin film of vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet or on a griddle. Add the pancakes and cook over medium to medium-low heat until the bottoms are set and golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully turn and brown the other sides. Serve hot.
