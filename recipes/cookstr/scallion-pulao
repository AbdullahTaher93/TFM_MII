Put the rice in a large bowl, wash in plenty of water 2 or 3 times, and drain. Add 3 cups (600 ml) water and soak for 30 minutes. Drain in a fine strainer. Place a nonstick saucepan over medium heat and add the oil. When small bubbles appear at the bottom of the pan, add the cumin. When it begins to change color, add the scallion bulbs and garlic, and saut√© for 2 to 3 minutes or until browned. Gently stir in the rice. Add 3 cups (600 ml) water, the salt, and garam masala, and stir. Lower the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes or until the rice is tender and all the water is absorbed. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with the lemon juice. Fluff the rice up with two forks, garnish with the scallion tops, and serve immediately.
