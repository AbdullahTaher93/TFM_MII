Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Combine the flours, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse for a few seconds. With the machine on low speed, add the chilled butter, one piece at a time, until the dough resembles a coarse meal. Add the vanilla extract and lemon juice, pulsing on and off until the dough becomes wet and sticks together when you pinch it. Remove the dough from the machine and shape it into either 4 disks or 1 large disk, both about ¼ inch thick. Wrap the disk(s) in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Place the disk(s) on the prepared baking sheet, and flatten slightly with a rolling pin. Prepare the filling: Toss the plums in a bowl with the softened butter and the brown sugar. Spoon the filling onto the center of each disk, and spread it out evenly, leaving ¾ inch around the edges. Fold over and pinch the edges to create a rim for the galette. Sprinkle sugar over the top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the galettes are dark brown and the plums are bubbling. Let cool before serving.
