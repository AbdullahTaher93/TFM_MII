Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) Crust: In a bowl, combine cookie crumbs, pecans and butter. Press into bottom of cheesecake pan and freeze. Filling: In a mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed until very smooth, for 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Stir in orange zest, nutmeg and vanilla. Fold in cranberries by hand. Pour over frozen crust, smoothing out to sides of pan. Bake in preheated oven until top is light brown and center has a slight jiggle to it, 60 to 75 minutes. Let cool on the counter for 10 minutes (do not turn the oven off). The cake will sink slightly. Topping: In a small bowl, combine sour cream, sugar, vanilla and orange zest. Pour into center of cooled cake and spread out to edges. Bake for 5 minutes more. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours before serving.
