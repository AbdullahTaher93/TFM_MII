Cook the noodles in lots of lightly salted water following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions; take care not to overcook. Drain, refresh in cold water and place in a bowl. Soba noodles can easily stick together like glue, so handle them carefully and leave some water in the bowl to keep them moist. Heat a griddle until hot and smear the chicken with a little oil to prevent it sticking. Broil the chicken for about 5 minutes each side or until cooked through. Set aside to rest and slice just before serving. Have all the prepared vegetables to hand before you start to cook them as they are cooked very quickly. Bring the stock to a boil and add the mushrooms, hoisin sauce, mirin, and soy sauce. While the stock is coming to a boil again, refresh the noodles in hot or boiling water, drain well and divide among four warmed soup bowls. When the stock boils, quickly add the scallions and peas or spinach. Remove the stock from the heat and, with a slotted spoon, divide the vegetables between the soup bowls. Scatter over the sliced chicken and finally pour over the stock. Garnish with a few sprigs of cilantro and serve.
