In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add leeks and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until softened. Add shallots and carrots and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until fragrant. Stir in peas, vegetable stock, rice milk, bouquet garni and mint and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until peas are tender and flavor develops. Discard bouquet garni. Add parsley and let stand for 1 minute. In a food processor or blender, or using an immersion blender (see Notes), pur√®e soup, in batches if necessary, until smooth or desired texture is achieved. If necessary, return soup to pot and reheat until steaming. 4. Stir in lemon juice, and sugar, if using. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot. If you prefer a cold soup, transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours or until thoroughly chilled.
