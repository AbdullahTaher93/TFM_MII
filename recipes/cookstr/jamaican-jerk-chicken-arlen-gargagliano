Make the sauce: In a large bowl, combine the thyme, sage, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, peppers, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, orange juice, and lime juice. Add the olive oil. Pour the liquid mixture into the spices, and add the garlic, onions, scallions, and hot pepper if desired. Take out half the sauce, and put it aside to heat later as a dipping sauce. Prepare the chicken: With a sharp knife, cut each chicken breast into ten pieces, first by cutting it in half horizontally, and then cutting each half into chunks. Place the pieces in a shallow dish, and pour half the jerk sauce over them. Cover the chicken and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes but preferably overnight. (The longer you can marinate the chicken, the more the flavor will penetrate the meat.) To cook the chicken, in a medium-size sautè pan, sear the chunks for about 3 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. (You could also place them on an oiled baking sheet and cook in a preheated 400°F oven for 8 to 10 minutes.) In the meantime, pour the sauce you set aside into a medium-size saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for about 15 minutes. If more liquid is needed (though you don’t want it to be too runny), add some fresh orange juice. Let cool slightly and transfer to dipping bowls. Serve the chicken immediately or at room temperature, on a platter, with a shot glass of toothpicks for serving and the extra jerk sauce for dipping.
