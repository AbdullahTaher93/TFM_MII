In a covered Dutch oven cook potatoes in boiling salted water about 10 minutes or until almost tender. Remove with a slotted spoon. Add asparagus to boiling water. Cook about 2 minutes or just until tender; drain. Immediately place asparagus in a bowl of ice water to stop cooking; drain. Drizzle potatoes and asparagus with oil; sprinkle with garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper. Place potatoes and asparagus in a grill basket; set aside. Trim fat from steaks. Sprinkle steaks with the cracked black pepper and kosher salt; rub in with your fingers. For a charcoal or gas grill, place steaks on the rack of a grill directly over medium heat. Cover and grill for 10 to 13 minutes for medium rare (145°F) and 12 to 15 minutes for medium (160°F), turning once and brushing with Port Glaze during the last 5 minutes of grilling. Remove steaks from grill; sprinkle with cheese. Meanwhile, place grill basket on grill rack. Grill for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden grill marks appear on potatoes and asparagus, turning basket occasionally. Slice steaks diagonally across the grain. Halve potatoes. Spread mesclun on a large serving platter. Arrange steaks, potatoes, and asparagus on top of mesclun. Drizzle with Port Vinaigrette.
