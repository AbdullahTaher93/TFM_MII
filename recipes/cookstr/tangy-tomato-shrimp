Preheat a large wok or skillet over high heat for 1 minute. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil and heat until it becomes runny and starts to shimmer. Add the onion and tomatoes and stir and cook until the tomato skins start to slip off and the flesh softens, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook and stir until the tomatoes are slightly mushy and the juices are released, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the tomato mixture to a plate and set aside. In the same wok, swirl in the remaining oil and heat over high until it becomes runny and starts to shimmer. Toss in the shrimp and sprinkle with the salt. Stir and cook for about 2 minutes. Don’t worry if not all the shrimp have turned pink yet. Preheat a large wok or skillet over high heat for 1 minute.

Splash in the vinegar and stir to mix. Simmer over medium heat until all the shrimp have turned pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Shrimp cooks really fast so don’t step away from the stove. You don’t want to overcook the shrimp as they will be rubbery. Remove from the heat and serve immediately with freshly steamed rice and a vegetable side dish.
