Place all the ijeh ingredients in a medium-size bowl and mix well. Heat 4 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat for 30 to 45 seconds, reduce the heat to medium, and drop 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture at a time into the hot oil. Fry 3 to 4 portions at a time. Watch the skillet carefully, as the ijeh fry rapidly. When the edges of the patties start to brown and curl, turn and fry until both sides are puffy and golden, about 1 minute. Remove immediately to a plate covered with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining cheese mixture. Add more oil to the skillet during frying if necessary. (Any type of ijeh may be prepared in advance and set aside at this point. To reheat, place on a baking sheet or ovenproof plate, cover with aluminum foil, and place in a preheated 350Â°F oven until sizzling. Ijeh may also be fried, frozen, and then reheated while still frozen in the same manner.) Have hot quarters of pita ready. Place the ijeh in the pockets and serve immediately.
