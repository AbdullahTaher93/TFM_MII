Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the glaze, bacon, and parsley and mix well. Turn the mixture into a lightly sprayed or oiled 9-by-5-inch loaf pan and gently pat down. Spread the glaze on top of the loaf and arrange the bacon strips neatly to cover, Bake until the loaf is firm and the bacon is crisp, about 1 hour. Let stand in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Remove the loaf from the pan and transfer to a platter. Garnish with the parsley sprigs. This glaze adds flavor and appeal. In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients.
