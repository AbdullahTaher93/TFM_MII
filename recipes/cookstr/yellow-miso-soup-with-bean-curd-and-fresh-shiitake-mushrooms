Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and gently cook without browning them, stirring occasionally, until tender and just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season lightly with salt, remove from the heat, and set aside. Bring the dashi to a bare simmer in a medium saucepan. Stir in the miso paste, mashing it against the sides of the pot to help it dissolve. Keep the soup at no more than a bare simmer. Divide the mushrooms, bean curd, and scallions among six small soup bowls. When ready to serve, divide the soup among the bowls, top with lids if possible, and pass immediately.
