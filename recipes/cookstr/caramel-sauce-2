Place the sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat, shaking and swirling the pan without boiling until the sugar dissolves. Then bring to a boil, cover, and cook for 1 minute. Remove the cover and boil until the syrup develops a rich, dark color, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the butter, stirring to melt, then stir in the cream and vanilla. Transfer to a bowl and serve warm or at room temperature. Or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Reheat in a heat-proof container in the microwave on high heat for 30 seconds or over a pan of simmering water.
