Sift the flour and salt together into a medium bowl. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle 10 tablespoons ice water over the mixture and use a fork or the pastry blender to toss the mixture together, adding more water, a little at a time, until you can gather the dough into a ball with your hands. Handling the dough as little as possible, form it into two balls and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. You can even freeze the dough for up to 1 month; thaw it in the refrigerator for 1 day before using it. To roll out the dough: Work with one ball of dough at a time. Sprinkle the work surface with a little flour. Unwrap the dough and place it on the flour. Starting in the center and using even pressure, roll the rolling pin away from you toward the outer edge. Give the dough a Â¼ turn, sprinkle with more flour and roll out from the center again. Repeat the rolling, turning and flouring until you have a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Hold the pie plate over the dough to make sure the circle is about 2 inches wider than the plate all around. To lift the pie crust: Wrap the dough over the rolling pin and lift it over the pie plate. Unroll the dough evenly onto the plate. Gently press the dough into the bottom. If making a single-crust pie, trim the excess, roll the edge under, then crimp as in the picture above. If making a double-crust pie, spoon the filling into the bottom crust, roll out the second ball of dough and cover the filling. Press the edges together to seal the two crusts. Trim away the excess, leaving 1 inch hanging over the edge. Roll the edge under then pinch the edge to crimp, as above. With the tip of a knife, cut 2 or 3 slits in the top crust so the steam can escape while baking.
