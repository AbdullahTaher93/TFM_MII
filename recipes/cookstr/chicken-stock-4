Rinse the chicken wings. Put them in a stockpot and add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. Bring the mixture just to a boil over high heat, skimming and discarding the surface skim with a slotted spoon. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, skimming frequently, for 20 minutes. Add the onions, carrots, celery, parsley, thyme, bay leaf, and peppercorns;simmer for 2Â½ hours. Strain the stock and skim off all the fat that rises to the surface. (Alternatively, cool the stock and refrigerate it overnight. The fat will harden on top of the stock and is much easier to remove.) Return the stock to the pot and simmer until reduced by one-third, about 30 minutes. Divide the stock among several resealable plastic bags and freeze it.
