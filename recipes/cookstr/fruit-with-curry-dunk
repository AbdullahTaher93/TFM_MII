Heat the broth and blend in the curry powder. Stir a little water into the arrowroot and stir slowly into the broth. Cook and stir until thickened. In the meantime put the raisins in hot water to puff them. Drain, add to the sauce, and heat through. Keep the sauce hot in a chafing dish over hot water or in an electric skillet on very low heat (the mixture will thin out if too hot). Arrange two bowls, one containing the chopped nuts and the other the coconut. On a bed of ice, place fingers of chilled fresh fruit, such as pineapple, melon, banana, papaya, mango, or halved plums or apricots, whole figs, sliced peaches, or pear quarters. Brush with lemon juice to keep them from discoloring. Invite the guests to dunk a piece of fruit into the curry sauce and then into the chopped nuts and coconut. Raw Vegetables with curry dunk: Substitute fresh, crisp vegetables, such as celery stalks, radishes, green pepper strips, cucumber fingers, fresh raw asparagus, raw baby carrots, and scallions. This is also a delicious luncheon dish served with rice, chutney, crisp toast, and cool white wine.
