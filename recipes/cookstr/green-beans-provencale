Place the oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, just until the garlic begins to become aromatic, about 30-60 seconds; stir in the tomatoes. Cook, stirring, until tomatoes are just softened, about 30 seconds. Add the beans; toss with the tomatoes and garlic. Cook until beans are just warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss with fresh herbs.
