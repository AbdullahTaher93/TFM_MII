Peel away and separate the leaves of the Brussels sprouts. Discard the cores. In a large skillet, combine the oil, garlic, and salt. Cook over moderate heat, just until the garlic is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Brussels sprout leaves and cook just until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes more. Season to taste. Serve immediately.
