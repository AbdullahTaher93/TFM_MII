For the Custard: Whisk the first 5 ingredients in an 8 × 8 × 2-inch glass baking dish. Using a 3½-inch biscuit cutter, cut the brioche slices into rounds; discard the trimmings. Add the brioche rounds to the egg mixture and let soak until the mixture is absorbed and the brioche is soaked through, about 8 minutes per side. Melt the butter on a heavy griddle over medium-low heat. Add the soaked brioche to the griddle. Cook until golden brown and just cooked through, about 6 minutes per side. For the Caramelized Pears: Melt the butter in a heavy large saute pan over medium-high heat. Stir in the sugar. Add the pears and saute until crisp-tender and golden brown, about 8 minutes. To Assemble and Serve: Place 1 brioche round in the center of each of 4 large plates. Drizzle the caramel sauce and vanilla sauce around the brioche. Arrange the pear wedges alongside and serve immediately.
