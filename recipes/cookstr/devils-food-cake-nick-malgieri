1942 Devilâ€™s Food Cake Layers Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Melt the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl set over hot, but not simmering, water. Let cool. Stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl, mixing well. Add the butter to the chocolate, then pour in the boiling water and stir well to mix. Whisk in the sugar and sour cream. Stir in the flour mixture. Whisk in the eggs. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the layers are well risen and firm to the touch; and a toothpick inserted emerges clean. Cool the layers in the pans on racks for 5 minutes, then unmold onto racks to finish cooling.
