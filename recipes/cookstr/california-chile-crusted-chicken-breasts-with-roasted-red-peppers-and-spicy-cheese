Preheat oven to 450°F. Trim chicken and pound between two sheets of plastic wrap to an even ½-inch thickness. Arrange chicken on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cut open the chilies to lay flat and remove any seeds or membranes. Lay one chili on each chicken breast. Puree the roasted peppers in the food processor and stir into the mayonnaise. Divide the mixture evenly among the chicken breasts and spread to cover the entire surface of each. Toss together the breadcrumbs and cheese. Mound on top of each breast, covering completely and patting down lightly. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and breadcrumb topping is nicely browned.
