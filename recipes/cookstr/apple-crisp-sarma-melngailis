In a large bowl, toss the apples with the vanilla agave. Spread the apples in a shallow pan and place it in the dehydrator. Dehydrate for about 4 hours, stirring once or twice. Place half of the dehydrated apples in a food processor and blend. If needed, add a tablespoon or two of water to achieve an applesaucelike consistency. In a bowl, mix together the blended apples and the apple pieces. Place the pecans in a food processor and blend just until they begin to release their oils. Transfer to a bowl and mix in the remaining ingredients. Divide the crisp between 2 teflex-lined dehydrator trays and spread it out. Dehydrate for 24 hours or more, until dried and crispy. Divide the filling among individual ramekins, or place it in a shallow baking dish. Top the filling with the crisp. Before serving, place the apple crisp in the dehydrator for about 1 to 2 hours to warm it through. Just before serving, drizzle with the vanilla agave.
