In a large bowl combine the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the chicken livers and coat them with the flour mixture. Shake off any excess. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken livers and brown on both sides. Add the onion, garlic, anchovies, capers, and sage and continue cooking until the onion is translucent, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the marsala and cook until it has reduced by half. Add the chicken stock and simmer still over medium heat for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl beat the egg yolks with the lemon juice until smooth. Toast or grill the bread and rub each slice with the remaining garlic clove. Set aside. Slowly stir the yolk mixture into the pan with the chicken livers. Make sure the egg yolks don't scramble. When done, the sauce should be a velvety consistency that coats the livers. Taste for seasonings and serve on the toasted bread slices.
