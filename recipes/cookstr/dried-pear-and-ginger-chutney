Mix the pears, ginger, and raisins in a medium, nonreactive, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cover with the sugar, water, lemon juice and zest, vinegar, eau de vie, cinnamon stick, and salt. Stir to dissolve the sugar and salt. Simmer slowly over medium heat to break down the dried fruit and ginger, stirring occasionally. Bring to a low boil and then reduce the heat. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture resembles a chunky jam. Check the seasonings and adjust if necessary with a squirt of fresh lemon juice and/or a pinch of salt. (It should be plenty sweet, but you donâ€™t want it to be too sweet.) Remove from the heat and let cool before serving. Remove the cinnamon stick. The chutney will keep, tightly covered in the refrigerator, for about 1 week.
