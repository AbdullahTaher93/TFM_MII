Rinse the bean sprouts well in cold water, drain, and place in a large bowl. Add the scallions and set aside. Place the remaining ingredients in a nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring with a wooden spoon to dissolve the salt and sugar. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Pour the vinegar mixture over the sprouts and scallions and stir gently to immerse all the vegetables. Let stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. Drain the bean sprouts and serve mounded on several plates.
