Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottoms of three 9-inch cake pans with parchment paper. Set aside. Combine the brown rice flour, garbanzo bean flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate large bowl, combine the olive oil, water, and maple syrup. Slowly whisk the flour mixture into the olive oil mixture until thoroughly combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake until the cake springs back when you press the center with your finger, about 25 minutes. Once the cake has cooled and you have prepared a frosting, assemble (see Notes). For cupcakes: Divide the batter evenly among 25 lined cupcake tin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
