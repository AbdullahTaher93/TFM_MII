To make the mayonnaise, use a mortar with a pestle for the best results. Mince the garlic and place in the mortar with the salt. Pound together until a smooth paste forms. Whisk the egg yolks into the garlic-salt mixture until it is pale and creamy. While whisking constantly, start to add the olive oil a few drops at a time until the mixture emulsifies and begins to thicken. At this point, you can begin adding the remaining oil in a thin, slow, steady stream. Continue whisking until all the oil is incorporated. Whisk in the mandarin orange zest and juice. Cover and refrigerate until serving. Alternatively, to use a blender, chop the garlic and place in the blender with the salt. Blend briefly, then add the yolks and blend briefly until pale and creamy. With the motor running, begin adding the olive oil. A few drops at a time until the mixture emulsifies and begins to thicken: At this point, you can begin adding the remaining oil in a thin, slow, steady stream. Add the mandarin orange zest and juice and pulse to incorporate. Cover and refrigerate until serving. Divide the asparagus into 2 equal piles and secure each pile, into a bundle with kitchen string. Pour water to a depth of about 5 inches into an asparagus pot or other deep, narrow pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Stand the asparagus bundles, tips up, in the pan, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook until the ends are tender when pierced with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Using tongs, remove the bundles from the water and lay them on a clean kitchen towel to absorb excess moisture. Cut the strings and arrange the asparagus, with all the tips in one direction, on a platter. They can be served warm or at room temperature. If water accumulates under the asparagus, pour it off before serving. Serve the asparagus with some of the mayonnaise spooned in a band over the spears and the remainder offered in a bowl alongside.
