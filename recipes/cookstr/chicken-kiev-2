Blend the butter with the garlic and herbs, either by beating them together with a wooden spatula or by putting everything in the food processor and processing until thoroughly mixed. Divide the seasoned butter into 6 equal pieces; shape them into long, tapered fingers and put in the freezer, covered with plastic wrap, until frozen hard. Cut off the chicken wing tips, leaving the wing bone on. Skin and bone each breast (see Notes) and cut in half lengthwise, so you have 6 half breasts. Remove the meat about halfway up the wing bone, to make a little handle. Put the chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper and flatten with a meat pounder , pushing down and outward as you pound. Be careful not to hit the bone or sever it from the breast. The chicken must be very thin, almost transparent. Put a finger of frozen butter in the center of each pounded breast (on the inner, not the skin, surface) and roll the chicken around it, tucking in the ends, so the rolled-up breast makes a neat sausage-shaped package. The butter must be completely sealed in so that it cannot leak out during the cooking. Dip the rolled breasts in flour, then in beaten egg, and finally roll in bread crumbs. Arrange on a cookie sheet covered with waxed paper; cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Or make them the day before you plan to serve them and chill until ready to fry. Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 370Â°. Fry the chicken rolls, 2 or 3 at a time, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels; put a paper frill on each wing bone and serve immediately.
