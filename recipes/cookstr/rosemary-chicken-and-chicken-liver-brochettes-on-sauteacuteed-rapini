To make skewers, closely trim the leaves of the rosemary branches to about ¼ inch. Leave about 2 inches at the uncut end of the branches untrimmed. Soak the skewers in a pan of water large enough to accommodate the branches for about 20 minutes before using. In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, 4 tablespoons of the oil, fresh rosemary, chopped garlic, salt, and pepper. Set aside. Wrap the chicken livers completely in the pancetta. Alternately thread the livers and chicken pieces onto the rosemary skewers. Brush with half the marinade or pour half the marinade into a long dish and marinate the brochettes at room temperature for ½ hour before grilling. Place on a lightly oiled grill and cook, covered, over hot or medium-hot coals for 10 to 12 minutes, or, uncovered, about 15 minutes, turning and basting frequently with the remaining marinade until the livers are evenly browned, firm, and slightly pink inside when cut and until the chicken is no longer pink inside. Remove from the grill and keep warm. Meanwhile, wash the rapini, but do not dry it completely. Cut into 1-inch pieces. Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic cloves and sauté for 1 minute, then add the rapini, pine nuts, and pepper flakes. (This might have to be done in 2 batches.) Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the rapini is tender and wilted, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the rapini among 4 plates. Arrange 2 or 3 skewers on top and serve immediately.
