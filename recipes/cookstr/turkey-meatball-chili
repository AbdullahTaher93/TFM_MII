Using your hands, combine bread and milk until bread is moistened. Mix in egg white, turkey, ketchup, mustard, salt and pepper until thoroughly combined. Form into 24 small meatballs. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook meatballs until evenly browned. When almost done, add onion and sauté until tender. Add flour, chili powder, cumin and oregano; sauté for 1 minute. Add broth and tomatoes; reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes, until meatballs are cooked through. Add beans and heat through.
