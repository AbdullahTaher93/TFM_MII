In a medium bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, tarragon, capers, and lemon zest. Stir in the lobster and 1 ½ cups fresh bread crumbs, mixing well. Make 12 bite-size cakes or four 2-inch-wide cakes, dividing the mixture evenly. Cover them with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 1 hour. Spread some Wondra flour or bread crumbs on a plate. Dredge the cakes on both sides, pressing the bread crumbs to adhere them. Preheat the oven to 375°F if you are serving the larger, appetizer-size cakes. Place the oil in a sauté pan and heat over a high flame until almost smoking. Reduce heat to medium and add the lobster cakes, cooking for about 1 minute on each side or until the coating is golden brown. Bite-size cakes are ready to serve and eat; transfer larger cakes to a baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 18 to 20 minutes.
