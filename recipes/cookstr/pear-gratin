Position a broiler rack 6 in (15cm) from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Quarter the pears and remove the cores. Place skin side down in a flameproof serving dish. Sprinkle with the blackberries and walnuts. Drop spoonfuls of mascarpone cheese over the pears and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Broil for 3â€“5 minutes, or until the mascarpone is bubbly and sugar begins to caramelize. Serve warm, with crisp buttery cookies. Variation: Pear and Raspberry Gratin Substitute raspberries for the blackberries and granola for the brown sugar.
