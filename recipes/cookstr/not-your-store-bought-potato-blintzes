Prepare the pancake batter: Whisk the eggs, milk, salt, and 10 tablespoons (½ cup plus 2 tablespoons) water in a medium-size bowl. Gradually add the flour, whisking until smooth. Allow to rest for 15 minutes. Lightly grease a 6-inch skillet, and heat it over medium-high heat. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the batter, taking the skillet off the heat momentarily as you quickly tilt the pan to cover the bottom with the batter. Cook the pancake on one side until it blisters–it takes only a few seconds. Slip the finished pancake (no, you don’t cook the other side) onto a plate or paper towel. Repeat until all the batter is used, sandwiching the finished pancakes between sheets of waxed paper or paper towels to keep them separated. (You probably will need to grease the skillet lightly after every third or fourth pancake–possibly more often if you are not using a nonstick pan.) To assemble the blintzes, form 1/3 cup of the potato filling into a small log and place it on the lower half of the fried side of each pancake. Roll the pancake, folding the ends in as you go. The blintzes can be either fried or baked. To fry the blintzes, melt about 1 tablespoon butter, margarine, or shortening in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add as many blintzes as will fit, seam side down, and fry on all four sides until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes altogether. Drain the blintzes on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining blintzes. To bake the blintzes, preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a nonreactive baking pan (a 13 × 9-inch pan will hold about 15 blintzes) with butter, margarine, or shortening. Place the blintzes, seam side down, in the prepared baking pan and dot with butter, margarine, or shortening. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.
