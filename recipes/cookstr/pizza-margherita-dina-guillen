Soak the plank for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the olive oil with the garlic, salt, and pepper. Set aside. On a well-floured surface, roll out the pizza dough as thinly as possible into a rectangle slightly larger than the plank you are using. Prepare the plank for grilling according to the instructions (see Notes). Lightly spray the toasted side of the plank with the cooking spray and dust with cornmeal. Place the pizza dough on the prepared plank, folding up the edges so that the dough is the same size as the plank. Lightly prick the dough all over with a fork. Close the lid and grill for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the pizza dough is lightly browned and crisp. Open the grill lid and brush the oil mixture evenly over the pizza dough. Lay the mozzarella slices on top of the crust, then the tomato slices. Close the lid and grill until the cheese is golden and bubbly and the tomatoes are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a clean work surface. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, sprinkle with the basil, and season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
