Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Grease 10 regular muffin cups or line them with paper liners. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and nutmeg in a bowl. Stir well and set aside. In another bowl, beat the egg and the sugar together until well combined. Stir in the melted butter, sour cream, vanilla, and applesauce. Add the dry ingredients to the liquid, and stir with a woodern spoon until just combined. Stir in the chopped pecans. Fill the muffin cups three-quarters full with batter. Top each muffin with a pecan half. Bake in the center of the oven until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out just clean, 20 minutes. Cool the muffins in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Then unmold them onto a rack to cool completely.
