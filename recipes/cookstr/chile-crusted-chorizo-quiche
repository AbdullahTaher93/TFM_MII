Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter a 9-inch pie plate, preferably ovenproof glass or pottery. Line pie plate with chiles, opening each one out completely and arranging with points at center of plate. Arrange chorizo in an even layer across bottom of chile crust. In a separate bowl, beat together eggs, cilantro, and cream. Very carefully pour into pie plate, being sure not to disturb distribution of sausage. Evenly sprinkle cheese over egg mixture, and then place onion rings in a circle just inside edge of pie plate. Sprinkle caribe or pequín evenly over all and bake for 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve with salsa on the side, if desired.
