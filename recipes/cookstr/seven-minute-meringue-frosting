Find a saucepan that is large enough to accommodate the bowl from the standing mixer to create a double boiler. Add water to the saucepan, but keep the water level just below where the bottom of the bowl will rest. Bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, in the mixer bowl, gently whisk the egg whites and sugar to combine. Set the mixer bowl over the simmering water, whisking the mixture constantly and slowly. The goal is to bring the mixture to body temperature (around 98Â°F) without curdling the egg whites. Move the mixer bowl to the mixer fitted with the wire whip attachment and whip on high speed until the meringue is thick, glossy, and cool, about 5 minutes.
