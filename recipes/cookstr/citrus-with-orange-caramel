Remove a wide band of the zest from 1 orange and slice into thin strips. Boil for 1 minute, then drain and set aside. Peel the rest of the fruits (see Notes), cut them into rounds, and put them in a bowl. Melt the sugar over medium heat in a light-colored skillet, stirring often until it turns a rich but not too dark caramel color. Standing back from the pan, pour in the juice. It will bubble ferociously, and the caramel will clench into a knot, but donâ€™t worry. Add the reserved orange zest, cinnamon stick, and clove. Continue cooking and after about 5 minutes the caramel will have dissolved. Add the orange-flower water, slide in the fruits and swish them around, then pour the fruits and sauce into a bowl. Serve chilled or at room temperature, garnished with a handful of pomegranate seeds and/or sprigs of mint.
