Preheat the oven to 400Â°F and line two roasting trays with foil. Throw the squash pieces onto both the roasting trays. Trickle over 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil and season generously with salt and black pepper. Toss together and bake for 30 minutes, or until they are soft and browning, turning halfway through. Meanwhile, put the ginger, garlic, green chili, and a pinch of salt into a mortar and pestle and bash to a smooth paste. Set aside. Put 1 tablespoon of oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. When it's hot, fry the onion for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden, and add the ginger, garlic, and chili paste. Cook for around 2 to 3 minutes, then tip in the can of tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Cook for around 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is rich and thick. Add the sugar, coriander, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and season with salt. Leave to cook for another 5 minutes, adding a little bit of water to get a good saucy consistency. Take the butternut squash out of the oven when ready and fold into the sauce. Serve with golden garlic raita and some fresh hot naan to mop it up with.
