. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Cut the sweet potato, zucchini, and bell pepper in ¼-inch-wide strips, then cut them into 2-inch lengths. Toss with the jalapeno, olive oil, ground chipotle, and salt in a 3-inch-deep roasting pan, and roast for 20 minutes. Stir the vegetables, then roast for 20 minutes more, until the zucchini is limp and browned and the sweet potatoes are tender. Let the vegetables cool, place in a large bowl, and mix in the beans. If using cheese, add to the vegetable mixture. Divide the Mexican Quinoa among the tortillas, and then top with the vegetables, placing the fillings in a rectangular shape in the middle of each round. Fold the sides in and then roll the wraps. If making ahead, wrap each in foil, so that they can be reheated in the oven. Serve with salsa.
