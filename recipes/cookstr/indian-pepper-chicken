1 Cut several ½- to 1-inch-long slashes in each chicken breast, and rub the breasts with half of the crushed black peppercorns. 2 In a small pot, combine the chicken stock and whole peppercorns and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and keep at a simmer. 3 Heat a tablespoon or so of oil in a large, deep skillet over high heat. Sauté the onions and garlic with the rest of the crushed black pepper for 3 to 5 minutes, until starting to lightly brown. Transfer to a bowl or plate. 4 Season the chicken breasts and livers with salt. Add the breasts to the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high, add the livers, onions and garlic, green peppercorns, and chicken stock (with or without the whole peppercorns left in), and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until the chicken breasts are cooked through. 5 Just before serving, stir in the butter (if desired) and the ginger. If desired, season with more crushed pepper to taste.
