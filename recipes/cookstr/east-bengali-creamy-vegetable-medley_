In a heavy-bottomed cooking pot, heat the mustard oil on medium heat for about 1 minute. Add the panch phoron and dried red chilies and heat for about 30 seconds until the spices begin to crackle and turn fragrant. Add the slit green chilies and vegetables and mix well. Cover and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes. Add Â¾ cup minus 2 tablespoons of water to the vegetable mixture and bring to a simmer. Simmer on low heat for about 15 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the water is almost evaporated. In the meantime grind the blanched almonds with 2 tablespoons water into a paste. Add the almond paste to the vegetable mixture and stir until it coats the vegetables with a thick dry sauce. Heat the ghee in a small skillet on medium heat and stir in the fennel seed powder and red pepper flakes. Pour the seasoned ghee over the vegetables and stir lightly before serving.
