Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C, or gas mark 4). Grease a 9 x 9-inch (23 x 23-cm) baking dish. Peel and slice the potatoes into ¼-inch (6-mm) slices. A mandolin or slicer attachment on your food processor will make quick work of the slicing. Place one layer of potatoes in the dish and season with a sprinkle of salt, pepper, and nutmeg, then some of the Gruyere cheese. Repeat until all of the potatoes are used up. When you get to the last layer of potato, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, then pour in the milk. Press down on the potato slices until you see the milk rise up along the edges of the baking dish to evenly distribute the milk. Top with the remaining Gruyere, cover tightly with foil, and bake for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the top is golden and the edges bubble. Let cool slightly before slicing and serving.
