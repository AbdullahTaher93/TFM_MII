Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet. Brown the potatoes well on all sides over a medium flame. Season with salt and pepper, then cover and reduce the heat. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a saucepan. Saut√© the onion and garlic until the onion is wilted. Add the tomato sauce, wine, parsley, chili pepper, Tabasco, salt, and pepper. Cook, uncovered, about 20 minutes. The sauce should be thick. You may serve the potatoes and the sauce separately or pour some of the sauce over the potatoes. In either case, the potatoes should be only lightly coated with the sauce.
