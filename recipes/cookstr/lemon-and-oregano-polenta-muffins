PREHEAT THE OVEN to 425°F. Butter a 12-cup standard-size muffin pan thoroughly. IN A SMALL SKILLET, heat 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat and sauté the shallot until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. In a small mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Stir in the polenta with a fork until the dry ingredients are evenly blended. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, melted butter, sour cream, and milk until well combined. Add the softened shallot, lemon zest, oregano, and the dry ingredients and stir with a fork until just blended. Do not overmix. Divide the batter equally among the muffin cups, filling them all the way up. BAKE FOR 20 MINUTES, or until puffed and deep golden. Cool on a rack and serve while still slightly warm.
