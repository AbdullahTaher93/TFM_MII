Press the cabbage with the umeboshi paste and vinegar for 1 hour (see Notes). While the cabbage is pressing, fill a 4-quart pot halfway with water and bring to a boil. Add the corn and quickly blanch for a minute or two. Remove the corn with a slotted spoon and place in a large salad bowl. Add a pinch of salt to the same water, then add the kale and blanch for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and spread on a tray to cool. Add the cooled kale to the corn, along with the carrots, radishes, daikon, pressed cabbage, olive oil, and lemon juice. Toss the ingredients, add salt and pepper, and toss again before serving. Variations: • Add 1 teaspoon minced garlic, or 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard. • Add ¼ cup toasted pumpkin or sunflower seeds. • Add sauerkraut or slivers of dill pickle.
