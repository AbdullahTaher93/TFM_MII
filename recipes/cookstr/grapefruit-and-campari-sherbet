Combine the sugar and the gelatin in a medium saucepan and stir well to mix. Whisk in the water and the corn syrup. Bring the syrup to a boil, stirring occasionally. Pour the hot syrup into a bowl and cool it to room temperature. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the syrup until it is very cold. If there is a film on the syrup, ignore it and stir the grapefruit juice and the Campari into the syrup. Freeze the mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s directions. While the sherbet is churning, place a bowl or other container in the freezer. Empty the churned sherbet into the bowl as you remove it from the ice cream maker. Press plastic wrap against the surface and freeze the sherbet. Remove the bowl from the freezer to add the remaining sherbet when it is ready. SERVING: Serve the sherbet in chilled dessert bowls or glasses. A garnish of fresh berries or other fruit makes a good accompaniment. Or use this sherbet when an ice is suggested for serving in the cake and fruit desserts chapters.
