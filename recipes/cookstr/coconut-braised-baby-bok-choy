In a large skillet, combine garlic, hot pepper flakes and coconut water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Arrange bok choy evenly in skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 5 minutes or until tender. Using tongs, transfer bok choy to a serving dish, cover and keep warm. Increase heat to medium-high and boil broth mixture until reduced to about Â¼ cup (60 mL). Stir in black pepper and coconut oil. Pour over bok choy.
