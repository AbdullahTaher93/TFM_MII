Rub the preserves through a strainer with a wooden spoon or put through a food mill. Boil the water and sugar together for 5 minutes to make a simple syrup, then cool until cold. Combine the apricot pur√©e and the syrup, mixing well. Whip the heavy cream in a chilled bowl with a rotary beater or electric hand mixer (or in the bowl of an electric mixer) until it has doubled in volume and holds its shape when the beater is lifted. Fold the cream thoroughly into the apricot mixture with a rubber spatula, then pour the mixture into refrigerator ice trays and put in the coldest part of the freezing compartment or freezer until frozen around the edges and mushy in the center. Remove, turn into a bowl, and beat with a wooden spatula until smooth. Return the trays to the freezer. Repeat this beating process 1 or 2 times, then return to the freezer and freeze until hard. The beating process keeps the ice cream from forming crystals and makes it smooth.
