Combine the soy sauce, sake, ginger; sugar, and water in the pressure cooker over medium-high heat. When beginning to boil, stir in the leek and mustard greens. When the greens wilt, add the daikon. Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and let sit for 3 minutes to finish cooking. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure. Transfer the vegetables to a serving platter, top with the tofu and enokis, and serve right away.
