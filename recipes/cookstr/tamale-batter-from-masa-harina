Place the lard in a small bowl and whip with the hand mixer at medium speed until light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Combine the masa harina, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour in the broth and whip at medium speed until all the liquid has been absorbed. Continue whipping as you slowly add the lard, a spoonful at a time. Once the last spoonful of lard has been added, raise the mixer speed to high and continue to mix until the batter is light and fluffy, about 10 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as you go. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. You can also make the batter in advance and keep it refrigerated in a tightly sealed container for up to 1 day.
