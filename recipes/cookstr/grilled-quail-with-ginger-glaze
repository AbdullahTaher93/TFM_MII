Using poultry shears or strong scissors, cut each quail down one side of the backbone. Open the quail and place on a work surface, skin side up. Press each quail firmly on the breastbone to flatten. Slash the breast skin with a knife. Mix the marinade ingredients in a small bowl. Place the quail in a nonmetallic dish. Brush the marinade over the quail, especially in the cuts. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Position the broiler rack 6in (15cm) from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Line a broiler pan with oiled aluminum foil and place the quail on the pan. Broil, for 12â€“15 minutes, turning once, until golden brown and the juices show no trace of pink when pierced at the bone with the tip of a sharp knife. Serve hot, with lime wedges for squeezing. Variation: Grilled Quail with Hoisin: For a sweet, Chinese barbecue flavor, replace the chilli sauce with hoisin sauce and the sesame oil with 1 crushed garlic clove.
