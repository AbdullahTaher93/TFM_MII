At least 2 weeks and up to 1 month before you will use the confit, select a jar large enough to accommodate the lemons. Cover the bottom of the jar with a 1-inch layer of salt and add the lemons, separating them with a 1-inch layer of salt and covering the top with a 1-inch layer of salt. Cover and refrigerate. If the salt becomes wet, pour it out and replace it with fresh. After 2 weeks, remove lemons from the salt, rinse, and peel with a sharp paring knife. Use the skin only, discarding the flesh. In a small saucepan, cover the lemon peel with cold water, bring to a boil over high heat, and boil 30 seconds. Drain and rinse in cold water. Cut into desired size.
