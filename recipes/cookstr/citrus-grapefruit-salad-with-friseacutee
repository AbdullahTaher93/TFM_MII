In a bowl, combine the avocados and grapefruit and scatter the scallions over the top. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste to make a vinaigrette. In another bowl, drizzle one-third of the vinaigrette over the frisée and toss to coat the leaves. Arrange the frisée in a bed on a platter. Pour the remaining vinaigrette over the avocado-grapefruit mixture and toss gently with your hands to coat evenly. Arrange the mixture on the bed of frisée and serve.
