Place the onion, garlic, chickpeas, flanken, potatoes, and 4 cups of the broth in the insert of the slow cooker. Place the curry paste and tomato paste in a medium bowl with the remaining 2 cups of broth. Whisk to blend the pastes with the broth, and then add it to the insert. Cover and cook on HIGH for 8 to 10 hours, or until the chickpeas, meat, and potatoes are very soft. Add the cauliflower and cook on HIGH for 1 more hour, or until the florets are tender when pierced with a fork. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve with jasmine rice cooked with saffron, and Cranberry-Mango Chutney.
