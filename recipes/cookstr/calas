Boil the rice in salted water until soft and mushy. Drain thoroughly and mash the rice until soft and creamy. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and add to the rice. Cover with a clean cloth and allow to sit overnight. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks until thick and creamy, gradually adding 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Fold in the spices and lemon zest. In another bowl, beat the egg whites with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar until stiff and glossy. Combine the egg yolks with the rice. Sift the flour into the mixture and mix well. Fold in the egg whites and mix just until no streaks show. In a large deep heavy skillet, bring 1 inch of oil to about 365°. One at a time, drop the mixture by teaspoonfuls into the hot oil and fry until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Dust the calas with confectioners’ sugar and serve in batches of one or two dozen.
