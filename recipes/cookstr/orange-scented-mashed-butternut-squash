Fill a large pot with 2 inches of lightly salted water and bring to a simmer over high heat. Add the squash, cover, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork or small, sharp knife. Drain the squash, and transfer it to the container of a food processor. Add the juice, butter, honey, zest, and salt and pepper to taste, and puree until smooth. Season again to taste. The squash can be prepared ahead. Place finished squash in a casserole dish. Cover and refrigerate up to 2 days. To reheat, place in a 350 degree F oven, covered, for 30 minutes, or until warmed through. Variations: Try substituting acorn squash or your favorite winter squash for the butternut. Add a large, peeled, chopped carrot to the pot with the squash. Add a dash of ground nutmeg, allspice, or cinnamon to the puree.
