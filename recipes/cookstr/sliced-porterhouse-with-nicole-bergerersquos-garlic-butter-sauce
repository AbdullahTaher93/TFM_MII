Pat the steaks dry. Lightly coat both steaks with oil and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. Combine the ketchup, Worcestershire, paprika, mustard, and vinegar in a medium-size heavy skillet and whisk to blend. Place the skillet on a turned-off burner. Put the garlic in a small dish and cover with plastic wrap. (The recipe may be prepared ahead to this point.) Preheat the broiler. Broil the steaks until seared and well-crusted on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn the steaks, season with salt and pepper, and broil 3 minutes more for rare or 4 minutes more for medium. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. While the steaks are cooking, warm the ketchup mixture over very low heat. When the steaks are resting, add the butter to the warm sauce, 1 or 2 pieces at a time, whisking constantly. The butter should melt but not liquefy. If it is melting too fast, remove the pan from the heat and continue to whisk. Once all the butter has been incorporated, stir in the garlic and season with salt. Carve the steaks into Â½-inch-thick slices and divide among 4 to 6 warm plates. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the sauce over each portion and serve immediately.
