For the lentils: In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils and water and bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer until just tender, about 10 minutes, and drain. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the olive oil until almost smoking. Add the bacon and cook 1 minute. Add the garlic and shallots and cook, stirring, until the mixture is softened but not colored, Add the cream, bring to a boil, and cook until bubbly and slightly thickened, about 1 minute, Add the lentils, thyme, and marjoram, bring to a boil, and simmer until the lentils are heated through, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. For the salmon: Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Season the fillets with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat until smoking. Add the fillets and sear on the skin side. Place in the oven until the fish is medium rare, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the pan to high heat and add the butter. Turn the fish and sear the other side 30 to 45 seconds. Turn the fish back over and remove from the pan. To serve: Divide the lentils among 6 warmed plates. Cover with a salmon fillet and drizzle about 3 tablespoons of the red wine sauce over and around the salmon. Serve immediately. Variations: Omit the bacon if you choose, although the lentils will lose their slightly smoky taste. Substitute Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes for lentils, a drizzle of Basil Oil for the sauce.
