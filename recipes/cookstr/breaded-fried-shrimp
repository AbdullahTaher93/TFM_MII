Mix together the bread crumbs, cornmeal, marjoram, thyme, and pepper in a shallow dish. Spread the flour in another dish. Beat the eggs in a third dish. Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels. Coat each shrimp in the flour, shaking off the excess. Dip in the eggs, then coat with the bread crumbs. Place on a baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Pour oil halfway up the sides of a deep saucepan and heat over high heat to 350°F (170°C). In batches, cook the shrimp for 2–3 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve hot.
