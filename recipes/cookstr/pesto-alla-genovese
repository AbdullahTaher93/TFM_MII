In a medium stone mortar, pound the garlic and pinch of salt into a smooth paste with a pestle. Gradually add the basil leaves, continuing to pound. Add the pine nuts and both cheeses and pound into a smooth paste. Add the 6 tablespoons olive oil, drop by drop, grinding the pestle in a circular motion until the pesto is completely amalgamated. Add more olive oil to adjust the taste or texture as you like. Season with salt.
