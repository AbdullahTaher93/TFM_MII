Transfer the pieces to a large flameproof casserole, pour the Cognac over, and flambé. Roast, uncovered, in a 325°F oven for 30 to 45 minutes, basting occasionally with a mixture of wine and melted butter. Remove from the oven. Add the cream to the pan, blend with the pan juices, and baste the chicken well. Return to the oven and cook for 20 minutes more. Serve with crisp fried potatoes and a cucumber, onion, and tomato salad.
