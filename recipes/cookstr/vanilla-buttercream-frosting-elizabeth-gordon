In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the shortening and the marshmallow cream on medium-high speed for 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the confectioners sugar, and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Blend in the vanilla and salt until thoroughly combined. The frosting may be used immediately or stored in an air-tight container and refrigerated for up to 1 week.
