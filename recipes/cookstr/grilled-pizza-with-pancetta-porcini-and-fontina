Preheat grill or barbecue. In a small bowl, pour ½ cup (125 mL) boiling water over dried mushrooms. Soak for about 20 minutes. Drain; squeeze mushrooms dry, reserving liquid. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook pancetta for 1 minute per side. If using a gas grill, ensure that one burner is on medium-high, with the rest on as low as possible. With a charcoal grill, you can achieve a similar effect by getting coals very hot, then arrange in a ring around perimeter of grill. Fold dough in half; place on coolest part of grill. Unfold so that dough is situated over cooler section of grill. Close lid; cook for about 3 minutes. When dough is bubbling on top and golden brown on bottom, flip using two metal spatulas. Brush grilled top of dough with half the olive oil. Evenly distribute mushrooms, pancetta, cheese and parsley over surface of dough. Drizzle remaining olive oil and ¼ cup (50 mL) mushroom soaking liquid over surface. Close lid; cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until cheese is melted and bottom is golden brown. Using two spatulas, remove pizza from grill to a cutting board. Let sit for 1 minute, then slice. Serve immediately.
