Combine sugar, milk, cinnamon, and salt in a large saucepan. Cook over high heat, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Boil to softball stage, 234°F (190°C) on a candy thermometer, or until a small amount dropped into very cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from water. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Stir in walnuts until coated and creamy. Turn out onto aluminum foil. Leave to cool until sugar coating is firm. Break apart walnuts that are stuck together and store in a tight-fitting container.
