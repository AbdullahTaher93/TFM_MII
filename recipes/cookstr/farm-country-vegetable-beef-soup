Heat the oil in a large soup pot over fairly high heat. Add all of the vegetables and the garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the stock, thyme, salt, pepper, and beef, if using, to the pot. Bring the soup a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the vegetables are just barely tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Taste, adding more salt and pepper if desired. Add the macaroni or shells to the soup and continue to cook a few more minutes, until the pasta is tender. Serve piping hot.
