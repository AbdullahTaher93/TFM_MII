Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl. Mix in the pecans. Cream the butter and brown sugar in a medium mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, sour cream, flavorings and peaches. Add the flour mixture and mix just until moistened. Spoon into muffin cups sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Mix the granulated sugar, 4 teaspoons cinnamon and the nutmeg in a small bowl. Sprinkle over the muffin batter. Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Cool in the muffin cups for several minutes and then remove to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm.
