Whisk together 1 cup beer, 1 cup flour, and ½ teaspoon salt until almost smooth. Strain the batter through a sieve and let rest, covered, at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. Check the consistency;it should resemble a slightly thick pancake batter. If it doesn’t, add more flour or beer. Combine the remaining ½ cup flour with ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper in a soup plate or plastic bag. Dip the item to be fried in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess before coating it in the batter. Most items should be fried at a temperature of 365° to 375°F and sprinkled with salt right after they are removed from the hot oil.
