Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 7 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the bell pepper and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the peppers soften, an additional 5 minutes. Stir in the broth, tomato sauce, curry powder, cumin, chili powder, cinnamon, celery salt, and pepper. Cover, raise the heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the flavors meld, about 45 minutes. Add the chicken, rice, and peanut butter and stir well until the peanut butter melts into the soup. Cover, return to a simmer, and cook until the rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Top each serving with peanuts as desired.
