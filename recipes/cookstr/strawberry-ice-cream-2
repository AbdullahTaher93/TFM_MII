METHOD Combine the berries, water, zest, and juice in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the berries release their liquid. Continue cooking until the berries break down, the liquid evaporates, and the mixture becomes jammy. Remove from the heat and cool completely. In a large bowl, combine the sweetened condensed milk, milk, vanilla bean, strawberry jam, and salt. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until it reaches soft peak. Fold in the strawberry mixture, and transfer to a shallow freezable container. Cover with plastic wrap or waxed paper pressed directly on the surface of the ice cream mixture, and place in the freezer for 6 hours. Scoop and serve with fresh berries, crème fraîche, toasted almonds, chocolate sauce, or a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinegar.
