In a medium skillet, cook the bacon until barely crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat from the skillet. Add the butter; heat until melted; add the onion; sauté over medium heat until golden. Stir in the chicken livers; sauté, stirring, just until cooked. Add the tomatoes and sage; cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Season with salt; add pepper to taste. Cut bacon into ¼-inch pieces and stir into sauce. Meanwhile, cook the fettuccine in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, or firm to the bite, 2 minutes for fresh and 5 to 7 minutes for dried; drain. Toss with the sauce and serve at once.
