Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. In a mixing bowl, toss the strawberries and rhubarb with the brown sugar, cinnamon, and cornstarch. Set aside while you make the crumble topping. In the bowl of a food processor, whirl the flour, pecans, sugar, and salt until crumbly. Place the mixture in a bowl and drizzle the oil over it. Thoroughly mix the oil into the flour and pecan mixture. Give the fruit mixture a stir and distribute it evenly among six 7- or 8-ounce baking cups or ramekins. Tap the bottom of the cups gently on a hard surface to settle the fruit. Spread the topping evenly over the fruit and place the cups on a baking sheet or large baking dish (easier to handle and also will catch any juices that bubble over). Bake until the fruit is bubbling and the topping browned, about 45 minutes. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
