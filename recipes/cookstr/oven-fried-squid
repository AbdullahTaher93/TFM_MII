Preheat the broiler. Combine the bread crumbs, garlic, and herbs in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl drizzle the squid with the olive oil and toss until all the rings are well coated. Add the squid to the crumb mixture and stir gently until all the rings are coated. Arrange the squid rings in a single layer on a nonstick baking sheet and broil for 3 to 4 minutes per side until lightly brown. Serve immediately.
