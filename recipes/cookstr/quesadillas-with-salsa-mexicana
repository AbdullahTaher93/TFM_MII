To make the salsa, combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Season with the salt. Set aside for about 1 hour to blend the flavors. Preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C). Heat a heavy frying pan over medium heat. Place 1 tortilla in the pan and heat for 30 seconds. Flip over and sprinkle ¼ cup of the cheese over the surface. Fold in half and press down lightly with a spatula. Cook, turning once, until the quesadilla is lightly toasted on both sides and the cheese has melted. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while making the remaining quesadillas. To serve, cut each quesadilla in half and serve immediately with the Salsa Mexicana and guacamole. Variation: BBQ Chicken and Cheese Quesadillas: Toss 1 cup shredded cooked chicken with 2 tbsp barbecue sauce, and mix in 1 cup shredded Monterey jack cheese instead of Cheddar. Serve with sour cream instead of guacamole.
