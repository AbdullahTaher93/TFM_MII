Coarsely chop half of the cantaloupe. Place the chopped cantaloupe in a blender and puree until smooth and thick (makes about 1 2/3 cups). Using a small melon baller, scoop enough of the remaining cantaloupe to make 1 cup of cantaloupe balls. Set the cantaloupe puree and balls aside. Beat 1 cup of the cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Cover the whipped cream and refrigerate. Heat the oil and butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and saute just until tender but not brown, about 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir until slightly translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the wine. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the wine is absorbed, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Stir in the cantaloupe puree and the remaining 1 cup cream. Cook until the rice is tender but still firm to the bite, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes. Stir in the prosciutto, then the cheese. Stir in the reserved cantaloupe balls. Fold the whipped cream into the risotto. Season to taste with fleur de sel and pepper. Transfer the risotto to 4 shallow bowls and serve.
