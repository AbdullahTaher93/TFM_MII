Place the red beans and 16 cups (1 gallon) water in a large pot. Simmer for about 2 hours until soft, stirring occasionally, then more frequently as the liquid thickens. Remove from heat and let cool. Drain the beans, but retain the water. Then push the beans through a mesh strainer, adding some of the reserved water to help strain. Discard the peels and residue. Pour the strained bean soup back into the pot. Wash and soak the rice in cold water for about 20 minutes. Add the rice to the soup and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the rice balls and cook for a few minutes longer. Serve either hot or at room temperature with either a side of salt or honey, depending if you like your porridge savory or sweet.
