Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Prepare a 12-muffin tin by generously greasing 10 of the tins with butter. Combine the thawed corn, milk, vinegar, sugar, and applesauce in a blender. Blend for 10 seconds to break up the corn kernels. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, and salt. Sift in the baking powder and baking soda. Whisk to combine. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and add the milk mixture. Fold together gently to combine; do not overwork the batter. Transfer 1/4 cup batter to each of the 10 buttered muffin tins. Bake until they are light golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffin in the middle tin comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool the muffin tin on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove the muffins to the rack and continue to cool them for 5 more minutes before serving. 5. Transfer 1/4 cup batter to each of the 10 buttered muffin tins.
