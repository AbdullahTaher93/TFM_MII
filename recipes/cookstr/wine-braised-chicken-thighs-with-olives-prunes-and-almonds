Toast the almonds in a small dry skillet over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until they are lightly browned and begin to smell toasty, 2 to 3 minutes. Watch carefully; nuts can burn quickly. Immediately transfer to a dish to cool. Pour the oil into the skillet you used for toasting the nuts and set over medium heat. When the oil starts to shimmer, scatter the garlic slices in the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is tender and starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon to a plate. Increase the heat to medium-high. Season the chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper, set them in the pan, bone side up, and cook until they are deeply golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Repeat on the other side. Return the garlic slices to the pan, along with the green olives and prunes. Pour in the red wine and immediately decrease the heat until the liquid is barely simmering. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid or double layer of aluminum foil. Let the chicken cook undisturbed until an instant-read thermometer inserted into its thickest part (without touching bone) reads at least 165°F, about 10 minutes. Remove the cover and use tongs to transfer the chicken to the dinner plate. Loosely cover with foil. Increase the heat to high and let the wine sauce bubble for a few minutes until it thickens. Taste, adjust the seasoning as necessary, and add butter if you’d like a little more richness. Pour the sauce over the chicken on the plate, top with the toasted almonds, and eat.
