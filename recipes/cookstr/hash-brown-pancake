Using the medium holes on a grater, grate the potatoes into a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter in a medium-size nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the potatoes and pat them down to form a pancake. Cover the skillet and cook until the bottom of the “pancake” is browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Turn it over carefully, cover, and cook 10 minutes longer or until nicely browned. Cut into four sections and serve immediately.
