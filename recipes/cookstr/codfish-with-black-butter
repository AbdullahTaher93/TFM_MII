For four servings, measure out the capers (the larger capers are softer and absorb too much of the vinegar in the jar). Bring a small pot of unsalted water to a boil. When it boils, drop the steaks in and let the water come back to a boil. This will take 3 or 4 minutes. When the water starts boiling, turn off the heat, and let the fish steep in the hot water for 2 to 3 minutes, until it is barely cooked, just enough so that you can see the flakes. Meanwhile, prepare the butter. Melt the butter in a skillet, and cook until the butter foams and begins to brown. The foam will disappear, and the butter will begin to darken slightly to a darker brown. It is ready. Drain your fish steaks on paper towels to absorb excess water, and arrange one on each of four warmed dinner plates. Sprinkle the capers on and around the fish, and pour the very hot brown butter on the fish. Pour the red wine vinegar into the hot skillet, and shake it around. Most of it will evaporate, but pour the remainder on the fish. Sprinkle on some freshly ground pepper, a little coarse sea salt, and some shredded basil, and serve right away. This favorite way of serving cod also works well with other fish, from salmon to trout.
