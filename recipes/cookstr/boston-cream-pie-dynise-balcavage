To Make the Cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F (150°C, or gas mark 4). Grease two 9-inch (23 cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with circles of parchment paper. This is very important to prevent sticking! In a large bowl, sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, cornstarch, and salt. (You don’t have to sift, but it makes for a lighter cake.) In another bowl, combine the margarine, milk, and vanilla. Using a mixer, mix the wet ingredients into the dry, about ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, and mix until smooth. Pour into the prepared pans and bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. Let cool completely and then trace a knife around the perimeter of each cake to loosen before removing from the pans. To Make the Creamy Filling: Process all the filling ingredients in the food processor until smooth. To Make the Ganache: In a medium saucepan, whisk all the ganache ingredients together over medium heat until smooth and just melted. Do not refrigerate. Place one cake on a serving dish. Spread the creamy filling on top and top with the other cake, flat side up. Pour the ganache over the top while still warmish, allowing it to drip down the sides. Refrigerate for a few hours before cutting.
