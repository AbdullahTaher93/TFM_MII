To make the vinaigrette, mix all the ingredients in a jar with a tight fitting lid and shake vigorously. For the sugared pecans, heat the sugar, water, salt and pepper together in a small saucepan until bubbly. Add the pecans and toss to coat. Cook over medium-low heat until coated and caramelized. (They will become shiny and the outside and coating will begin to harden.) Once they start cooking, they need to be constantly stirred or they will burn. Once the pan begins to smoke and pecans are fragrant, place the pecans on wax paper to cool. (If making ahead, store in a sealable plastic bags or airtight container.) Toss the desired amount of the vinaigrette with the spinach, bacon, red onion, cranberries and blue cheese. Top with pecans and grind fresh pepper over the top, if desired. Refrigerate remaining vinaigrette. Variations: Red leaf lettuce or any combination of lettuces may be used in place of spinach. Almonds and walnuts are also delicious sugared. For color and texture, add mandarin oranges, unpeeled slices of Red Delicious apples, or diced pear, if desired. Pear, champagne or raspberry vinegar may be substituted for the balsamic vinegar. This dressing made with balsamic also pairs well with greens mixed with tomatoes, toasted pine nuts, diced red onion and feta or blue cheese.
