Quickly rinse and dry the mushrooms, and trim off the ends of the stems. Cut any large mushrooms in half. Coat a large nonstick wok or 12-inch skillet with olive oil cooking spray and preheat over medium to medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, onions, garlic, and Italian seasoning, and cook, stirring often, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender. While the mushrooms are cooking, place the water in a 1-quart saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the couscous and cover. Remove from the heat, and allow to sit for 5 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Using a knife, slightly cut up the tomatoes in the can. Add the tomatoes, beans, and cayenne pepper to the mushroom mixture. Stir to mix, and cook for about 3 minutes, or until heated through. Stir the parsley into the couscous. Divide the couscous among individual serving plates, and top with the stew. Serve immediately, as is or topped with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.
