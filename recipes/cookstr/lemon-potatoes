Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Oil a 17-x-12-x-1-inch baking sheet. Cut one of the lemons in half and squeeze to obtain 2 tablespoons juice. Trim the ends off the remaining 2 lemons and cut the lemons into thin, even slices. Remove the seeds. Scatter the slices over the pan. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the olive oil, lemon juice, rosemary, salt, and pepper to taste. Scrape the potatoes onto the pan, spreading them out into a single layer. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the potatoes are just beginning to brown. Turn the potatoes and lemons and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, or until browned and crisp. Serve.
