Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a 4-inch-diameter bowl upside down on the foil and draw around it; repeat to make 6 circles. Brush with vegetable oil. Evenly sprinkle each circle with 1 tablespoon sugar, covering completely. Using a hand-held blowtorch, caramelize the sugar (see Notes). Immediately sprinkle with the almonds; let cool for a few minutes, then carefully peel the caramel disks from the foil and set aside. Place 6 fluted cupcake papers in a muffin pan. In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the chocolate and the 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Place the bowl over a saucepan with 1 inch of simmering water, stirring until the chocolate melts. With a small spatula, spread the chocolate in a thin coating on the bottom and sides of each paper. Place in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to set. Carefully peel the paper from the chocolate cups and refrigerate the cups until serving time. To serve, place each chocolate cup on a dessert plate. Scoop the ice cream into 6 large round balls and place one in each of the chocolate cups. Scatter over a few berries, if desired. Arrange a caramel disk on top of each cup at a slight angle. Serve at once.
