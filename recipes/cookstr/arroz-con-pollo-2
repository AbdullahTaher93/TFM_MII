In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat for 30 seconds. Add chorizo and cook, stirring and breaking up with a spoon, until no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate. Drain off all but 1 tbsp (15 ml) fat from pan. Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic and onions to pan and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add salt and pepper; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add rice and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add white wine and saffron mixture; bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Add stock and tomatoes with juice; bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Return sausage to pan. 3. Arrange chicken over bottom of slow cooker stoneware and cover with sausage mixture. Place a clean tea towel, folded in half (so you will have two layers), over top of stoneware, to absorb the moisture. (Accumulated moisture affects the consistency of the rice. The tea towel will absorb the moisture generated during cooking.) Cover and cook on Low for 6 hours or on High for 3 hours, until juices run clear when chicken is pierced with a fork. Stir in red pepper, peas and paprika. Cover and cook on High for 20 minutes, until pepper is tender. MAKE AHEAD MAKE AHEAD Complete Steps 1 and 2, chilling sausage and vegetable mixtures separately.
