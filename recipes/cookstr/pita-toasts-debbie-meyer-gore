Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Cut each piece of pita bread in half and then crosswise, to form quarters. Separate into 24 pieces. Blend softened butter with other ingredients and let mixture stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Spread the butter mixture on the inside of the bread. Bake for approximately 5 minutes or until crisp (watch carefully). The butter mixture can be made ahead and brought to room temperature.
