Place the quinoa in a sieve and rinse under cold running water for about 1 minute. Finely chop the onion and carrots. Heat the oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and carrots and sauté, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. If the vegetables begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, add a tablespoon of water and continue to cook. Add the quinoa and sauté for another minute. Add the broth, the salt, and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let it stand covered 5 minutes longer. Adjust the seasoning and fluff up the grain with a fork before serving. Variation No-Frills, Fail-Safe Quinoa: After rinsing the grain, cook it in boiling salted water until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain for at least 5 minutes before using further to ensure it won’t be waterlogged. To reheat, simply sauté it in oil or butter, or dress it with ¼ cup salad dressing of your choice and serve it in a salad. Fluff it up with a fork before serving.
