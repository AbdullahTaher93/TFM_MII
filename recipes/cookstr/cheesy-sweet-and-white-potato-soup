Microwave the sweet potatoes and white potatoes separately on high until easily pierced with a knife. Allow 4 minutes per sweet potato and test; add another minute each until done. Allow 2 minutes per white potato; add another minute each until done. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slip the peels off and cut into large chunks. Pur√©e the potatoes in the food processor in two batches, adding 1 cup of water to each batch, until smooth and transfer to a soup pot. Or place the potatos in a soup pot with 2 cups water. Insert an immersion blender into the pot and process until smooth. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Add enough milk to make a fluid but fairly thick consistency. Add the cheese, salt, mustard, and nutmeg. Cover and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Let stand for 1 to 2 hours before serving, or serve at once. Top each serving with a sprinkling of green peas.
