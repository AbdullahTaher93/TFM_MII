Heat the oil over medium heat in large skillet or Dutch oven. Sprinkle the short ribs on all sides with the salt and pepper and place the ribs meat side down in the hot oil. Brown for about 5 minutes, turn, and brown each remaining side for 5 minutes. Remove the ribs from the skillet and set aside. Add the onion, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme to the skillet, stir, and, cook until the onion softens slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and 1 cup stock and stir. Return the meat to the pan, cover, and lower the heat. Simmer for about 1 hour, turning once and checking to ensure that the meat is nearly covered in liquid. If not, add the remaining 1 cup stock. Add the sweet potatoes, prunes, cinnamon sticks, and chestnuts to the skillet and recover. Continue to simmer for another 1Â½ hours, until the meat is tender and the sweet potatoes are soft. It is fine if the meat starts to fall of the bone. Remove and discard the bay leaves and cinnamon sticks. Serve the ribs hot, or chill and reheat the next day.
