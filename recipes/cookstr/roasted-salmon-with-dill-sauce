Remove the fish from the refrigerator. With a large kitchen knife, starting just behind the bones around the head, cut three parallel diagonal slashes into each side of the fish, almost down to the center bone. Place the fish on a diagonal in an 18-x-13-x-2-inch roasting pan. If part of the fish head and/or tail hangs over the corners, that is fine. Rub the olive oil and lemon juice into both sides of the fish, including the slashes, and into the interior. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper to taste. Cram 2 bunches of dill into the cavity of the fish. Chop the top fronds of the remainder and set aside. It will take about 1 hour for the marinating fish to come to room temperature. About 20 minutes before cooking the fish, heat the oven to 500°F with a rack in the center. Roast the fish for 25 minutes (2½ inches = 25 minutes). Using two very large spatulas, move the fish to a serving platter. Put the roasting pan on top of the stove and add the white wine, chopped dill, and dill seeds. Bring the contents to a boil while scraping the bottom vigorously with a wooden spoon. Let reduce by half. Use this liquid as a sauce.
