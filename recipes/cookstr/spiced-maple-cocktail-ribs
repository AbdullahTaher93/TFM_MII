Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the ribs in a shallow roasting pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 45 minutes. While the ribs are cooking, combine the remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Stir well and set aside. Remove the pan from the oven and drain off any fat. Toss the ribs with ½ cup of the marinade. Return them to the oven and bake, turning the ribs and basting them occasionally (if needed) with the remaining ¼ cup marinade, for 30 minutes. Serve immediately.
