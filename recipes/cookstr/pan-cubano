In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in 2 cups lukewarm water, stirring well. Set aside in a warm place until the yeast bubbles actively, 8 to 10 minutes. Combine the salt with 3 cups of the flour. Add this flour mixture to the yeast mixture, 1 cup at a time, beating it in with a wooden spoon or using the dough hook of an electric mixer at low speed. After each cup of flour, drizzle in about 1 tablespoon of lard. Once you have added the first 3 cups, use your hands to gradually knead in the remaining flour until the dough is smooth and velvety. Gather the dough into a ball and place it in a clean greased mixing bowl. Grease the top of the dough with the remaining lard. Cover with a dry, clean kitchen towel and place in a warm (80 to 90°F.), draft-free area to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and divide it in half. Shape each piece of the dough by stretching and rolling it into a long sausage shape about 1 foot long and 2 inches in diameter. Arrange the loaves 2 to 3 inches apart on a large baking sheet sprinkled with the cornmeal. Cover lightly with the towel and let the loaves rise for 5 to 7 minutes. Using a sharp knife, slash each loaf in 3 or 4 places and, if desired, place a bay leaf in each slit to decorate the loaf. Brush the loaves with water. Place a pan of boiling water in the bottom of the oven. Immediately place the baking sheet on the middle rack of the cold oven and set the oven temperature 400°F. Bake the loaves until they are crusty and sound hollow when tapped gently on top, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove the loaves to a rack to cool.
