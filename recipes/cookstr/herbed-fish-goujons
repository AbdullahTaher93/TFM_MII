Mix the bread crumbs, parsley, and smoked paprika well into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Spread the flour in another bowl. Whisk the eggs and 2 tbsp water in another bowl. Slice the fish into strips about ½ in (1cm) wide. In batches, coat the fish in the flour. Dip in the egg, then coat with the bread crumbs. Spread them, without touching each other, on a baking sheet. Add enough oil to come 1 in (2.5cm) up the sides of a large, deep saucepan and heat over high heat to 350°F (180°C). In batches, add the fish and deep-fry, turning once, about 2 minutes, until golden. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Transfer to a platter and garnish with the parsley. Serve hot, with the lemon wedges.
