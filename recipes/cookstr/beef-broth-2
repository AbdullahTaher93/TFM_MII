In a large stockpot or Dutch oven, combine all ingredients, ensuring vegetables and meat bones are well covered with water. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1½ to 2 hours, stirring occasionally and skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. After 1 hour, taste and add salt if necessary. Remove bones and strain stock through a sieve lined with cheesecloth, discarding solids. Allow stock to cool, then refrigerate. Once chilled, remove congealed fat from surface. Portion stock in 2½- to 3-cup (625 to 750 mL) portions for use in fondues. Freeze if desired.
