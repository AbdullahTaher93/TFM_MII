Heat the olive oil in a medium, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the beef shank to the pot. When the meat begins to brown on one side, flip to another side. Brown the meat on all sides, about 8 minutes total. Remove from the pot and set aside on a plate. Lower the heat under the pot to medium, add the onion and garlic, and cook until the onion has softened, about 3 minutes. Return the beef shank to the pot and add the broth slowly, using a wooden spoon to scrape the caramelized bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the bay leaves and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook for 1 hour, then skim any fat or bubbles from the surface and add the corn wheels. Cook for 30 minutes and then add the carrots. Cook until the carrots are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Add the green beans and zucchini and simmer until theyâ€™re tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the shank from the pot. Scrape all of the meat from the bone and cut the meat into bite-size pieces. Return the meat to the broth discarding the bone. Discard the bay leaves from the broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the soup with a sprinkling of red onion and some mint.
