Fry the bacon in a small frying pan over low heat so that the fat renders out, but do not allow it to brown too much and become crisp. Remove the bacon pieces with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the crumbled chorizo to the bacon fat and fry gently without browning for about 5 minutes. Remove the chorizo with a slotted spoon and set aside. In the same fat, fry the tortilla squares until they are completely crisp. Drain on paper toweling. Put the beans in a heavy, wide pan and add the whole chiles, bacon, and chorizo; heat through gently so they do not scorch on the bottom. When they just begin to bubble, add the cheese and chicharr√≤n. As the cheese just begins to melt, sprinkle the top of the beans with the tortilla squares and serve immediately, before they become soft.
