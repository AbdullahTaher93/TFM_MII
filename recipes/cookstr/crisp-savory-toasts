Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Place the butter, red pepper flakes, garlic, and shallot in mortar and mash with the pestle into a smooth paste. Slice the bread as thinly as possible, between Â¼ inch and 1/8 inch thick. Place the slices on a baking sheet. Thinly spread the garlic- butter mixture on one side of each slice and sprinkle lightly with Parmesan cheese. Bake the toasts until the tops are lightly browned, 30 to 40 minutes. The toasts should be dry but still a bit moist in the center. The same method can be used with butter, sugar, and cinnamon to make Crisp Sweet Toasts, which would be ideal for afternoon tea, for breakfast, or as a simple dessert. Start by using a sweeter bread, such as the Fig-Anise, Fruit-Nut, or Rye-Currant breads. Follow the chilling and slicing directions for Crisp Savory Toasts. For the topping, melt butter. Then combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Brush the slices with the melted butter and sprinkle the tops with the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Bake according to the directions for Crisp Savory Toasts.
