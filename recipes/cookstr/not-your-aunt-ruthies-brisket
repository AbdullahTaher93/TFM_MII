Trim most of the fat from the brisket, leaving only a thin layer. In a small bowl, combine the salt, garlic powder, onion powder, dill, paprika, and ginger. Rub the spice mixture over both sides of the brisket. Wrap the brisket tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or at least for 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place the brisket on a rack in a large, deep roasting pan. Spread the ketchup over the top of the brisket. Roast for 1 hour (you may wish to open a window, as roasting the brisket for this long at that high a temperature could generate some smoke). The top should appear caramelized when it’s ready. Remove the brisket from the oven, transfer it to a baking sheet, and set it aside to rest. Reduce the oven temperature to 250°F. Add the milk to the drippings in the roasting pan and mix well. Add the onion, orange, and fish sauce to the pan and mix well. Place the brisket in the roasting pan with the liquid and cover the pan tightly with foil. Return the roasting pan to the oven and continue roasting for 2 to 3 hours, until the brisket is fork tender. Uncover the pan and let the brisket stand in the liquid until it cools to room temperature. Transfer the brisket to a carving board and discard the liquid. Slice the brisket against the grain into thin slices. Serve on a serving platter.
