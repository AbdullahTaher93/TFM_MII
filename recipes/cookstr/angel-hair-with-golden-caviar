Cook and drain the pasta. Put the freshly cooked noodles into a warmed bowl with the butter. Toss well, until all the noodles are coated with butter, and then put a serving of pasta on each plate. Top each with a heaping tablespoonful of caviar and a lemon wedge. Each person should squeeze lemon juice over the noodles before he mixes in the caviar. Champagne or iced vodka accompany this admirably. Donâ€™t stint on the caviar if possible!
