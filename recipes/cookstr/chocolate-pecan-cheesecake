Melt chocolate in medium bowl set over, not in, simmering water, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly and reserve. Heat oven to 350°F (180°C) with oven rack in middle. Grease sides of a 9-inch (22.5-cm) springform pan. To Make the Crust: Combine pecans, flour, sugar, and melted butter in a medium bowl and press into bottom and slightly up sides of the prepared pan. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until pecans are toasted. To Make the Filling: Beat cream cheese in bowl of a heavy-duty mixer on Medium speed until creamy and free of lumps. Scrape down sides of bowl. Gradually add sugar, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally, and beat until smooth. Reduce mixer speed to Low and add eggs, one at a time, scraping down sides of bowl after each. Add flour and beat until smooth. Bean in whipping cream, reserved chocolate, and vanilla and pour into crust, smoothing the top. Bake 37 to 43 minutes or until cake edge is set and center (about 2 inches [5 cm] diameter) still jiggles. After removing cheesecake from oven, run a small metal spatula around cake edge so cheesecake doesn’t crack as it cools. Cool completely in pan on cooling rack, and then refrigerate several hours before cutting. To serve, release sides of springform pan and cut into slices (it will still be on the pan bottom). Garnish with whipped cream.
