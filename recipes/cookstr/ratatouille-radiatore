Cook the radiatore in a large pot of salted boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it is al dente. Drain, and rinse under cold water. Place in a large serving bowl, toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil, and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the eggplant, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the zucchini, mushrooms, and salt and pepper and cook until just softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, parsley, and capers and transfer to a bowl. To make the dressing, combine the garlic, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Whisk in the remaining oil and pour the dressing over the vegetables. Let the vegetables marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes, then add to the pasta, along with the basil. Taste to adjust the seasonings and serve at room temperature.
