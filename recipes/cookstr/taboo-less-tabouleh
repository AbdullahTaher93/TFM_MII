Combine the bulgur and boiling water in a medium-size bowl, and cover the bowl with a plate. Let stand for 20 minutes. Cut the scallions into large pieces (including the green parts) and place in the small bowl of a food processor (or in a mini food processor) with the parsley and mint, and chop until tiny. (Or, if you donâ€™t have a food processor, use a sharp knife to do this job.) Add the garlic, salt, half the olive oil, and half the lemon juice to the bulgur and stir well. Stir in the minced herbs and all the other ingredients, including the remaining olive oil and lemon juice. Cover tightly and refrigerate until serving time.
