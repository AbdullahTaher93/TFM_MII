Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. If your spinach is not prewashed, rinse the leaves under cold running water to remove all traces of dirt (you may want to rinse 2 to 3 times). Dry well in a salad spinner or use paper towels to squeeze out all excess water. Coarsely chop, discarding the stems, and set aside in a bowl. Heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook the onions, stirring, until golden and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cold water and chopped spinach. Cover and cook over low heat, mixing occasionally, until all of the spinach leaves have wilted, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Combine the cottage cheese and eggs in a medium-size bowl. Add the cheddar, 1 cup of the Parmesan, and the pepper and mix until just blended. Add the cooked spinach and mix well. Coat a 9-inch round baking dish (preferably glass) with oil. Pour in the cheese-spinach mixture. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan. (May be frozen for up to 3 weeks or refrigerated for up to 2 days at this point. Defrost before baking.) Bake in the center of the oven until the top is golden brown and the center is firm when pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes to allow the pie to set before serving. Top each serving with a dollop of the Yogurt-Mint Dressing.
