Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Cut off the top third of the garlic heads crosswise to expose the cloves. Drizzle each head with a tablespoon of the oil and wrap in aluminum toil. Place the garlic on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for about 40 minutes, or until soft. Allow to cool, then squeeze the garlic doves out of their skins. Store the garlic in plastic wrap or covered with olive oil in a glass jar up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.
