Wipe the roast with a damp cloth and then season with salt and pepper. Place in a large nonreactive bowl. In a medium bowl, combine the onions, carrot, celery, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves, vinegar, and 5 cups water. Pour the mixture over the meat, adding more water if the mixture doesnâ€™t cover it completely. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate for 4 days, turning daily. On the fifth day, remove the bowl from the refrigerator. With slotted spoons, remove the meat from the bowl; reserve the marinade. In a nonreactive heavy pot over medium heat, melt the beef fat and 1 tablespoon of the butter, When melted, add the meat and brown on all sides. Add the reserved marinade and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, partially covered, for 3 hours. Melt the remaining 5 tablespoons butter over low heat in a small saucepan. Add the flour and sugar and stir until dark brown, about 5 minutes. Scrape into the simmering meat mixture and stir well. Cover and continue cooking until the meat is tender, about 1 hour longer. Remove the meat to a warmed serving platter. Stir the crushed gingersnaps into the sauce and cook until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Pour the gravy over the sauerbraten and serve.
