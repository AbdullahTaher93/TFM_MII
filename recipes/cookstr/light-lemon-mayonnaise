Combine the oils in a small pitcher. Crack the egg into the jar of a blender and blend briefly to beat lightly. Add 2 tablespoons of the oils. Blend on high speed for 10 seconds. With the machine on the same setting, add the remaining oil in a very thin, slow, steady stream. It is crucial not to add too much oil at once or the mayonnaise will not emulsify. Turn off the blender motor. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the inside of the blender jar so that all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Stir the salt into the lemon juice and add it with the mustard and pepper. Engage the blender again to combine thoroughly. Use immediately or cover and chill. Homemade mayonnaise will keep for a week in the refrigerator.
