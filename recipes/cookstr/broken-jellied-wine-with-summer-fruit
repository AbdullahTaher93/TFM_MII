Sprinkle the gelatin over ¼ cup cold water and set it aside to soften. Combine the sugar with the ½ cup wine in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the softened gelatin. Stir until it’s thoroughly dissolved, then pour it into the rest of the wine along with the lemon juice. Mix well, then pour into a bowl or a compote dish and refrigerate until set. Wine seems to take longer to set than cream or fruit juices, so plan on at least 6 hours, or even overnight for a firm set. Chop the jelly into cubes, then serve it in the compote or in wine or Champagne glasses interspersed with the fruit.
