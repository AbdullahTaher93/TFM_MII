Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. In a large bowl, beat butter or margarine, shortening and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until incorporated. Beat in coffee. Add flour mixture and blend well. Fold in nuts and raisins. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls (5 mL), about 2 inches (5 cm) apart, onto baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool for 2 minutes on sheet, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
