In a small bowl, combine the ancho powder, cumin, garlic, salt, and pepper and stir to mix. Add the oil and whisk until a loose paste is formed. Rub the fish with the spice paste and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. Light a charcoal fire or preheat your gas grill on high. Oil the grillâ€™s cooking surface. Let the coals bum down to a medium-hot fire or adjust the gas grill burners to medium-high. Grill the fish until just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and coarsely chop. Divide the tortillas into 2 stacks and wrap each in aluminum foil. Place on the grill until heated through, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the green and red cabbage. To assemble the tortillas, take 2 tortillas, top it with chunks of fish, a dollop of the sauce, a spoonful of the Pico de Gallo, and some of the cabbage. Squeeze a wedge of lime over the filling, fold the tortillas, and eat. Lime-Cilantro Sour Cream Sauce: Use this sauce in place of tartar sauce or cocktail sauce with other grilled fish, scallops, or shrimp. Combine all ingredients in a 2-cup measuring cup and whisk until smooth. Refrigerate up to 4 hours until ready to use.
