Put the unopened vacuum-packed point cut piece of corned beef into a pot with water to cover that has been heated to about 180°F. Keeping the water temperature at about the same level, cook the beef for 3 hours. (Sometimes the bag cracks in the water and some of the juice comes out, but it doesn’t really matter.) After 3 hours of cooking, remove the corned beef from the bag and put it back in the pot with the potatoes, the onions, the leek, and the cabbage. (When preparing just the corned beef, cook it in the bag the entire time.) Continue to cook for an additional 45 minutes to an hour. At that point, the corned beef will have an internal temperature of 170 to 180°. Cut the corned beef against the grain into thin slices, and serve on warm plates with the vegetables and a little of the cooking liquid.
