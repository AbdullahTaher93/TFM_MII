Preheat your oven to 400°F. Roll the pork in the seasoning and thyme. Take an appropriately sized casserole-type pan and fry off the onions and garlic in a couple of lugs of olive oil. Cook on a medium heat for roughly 4 minutes until softened and tender. Push the onions to one side, add 1 knob of butter and fry off the pork until lightly golden. Add the quartered figs and 1 glass of Marsala, mix with the onions, add the rest of the butter, and cover with an appropriately sized piece of wet wax paper (because it is wet it sits snugly, allowing it to bake and steam as well as making a beautiful sauce). Cook in the preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour. After 20 minutes, turn the pork in the juices and add the other glass of Marsala. When the pork is cooked, remove to a plate and allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing. While waiting, finish the sauce by adding the chicken stock and simmering for 10 minutes. Check the seasoning and add the crème fraîche. Slice the pork as thinly as you want and serve with the delicious sauce.
