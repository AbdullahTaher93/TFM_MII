In a food processor fitted with metal blade, process cookies until crumbs form. Add butter and process until finely ground. Press onto bottom and up side of prepared pie plate. Freeze for 30 minutes or until firm. Spread half of the ice cream in prepared crust. Drizzle evenly with fudge sauce and sprinkle with half of the chocolate chips. Return to freezer until ice cream firms up a bit. Spread remaining ice cream over pie and return to freezer. In a bowl, using an electric mixer, whip cream, confectionerâ€™s sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Spread whipped cream over pie and sprinkle with almonds and remaining chocolate chips. Return to freezer for several hours or until completely frozen. Variation: Substitute cookies and cream or mint chip ice cream for the coffee. If using mint chip ice cream, use fudge sauce, not caramel.
