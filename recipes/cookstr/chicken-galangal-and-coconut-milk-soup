Heat peanut oil in a 2½- to 3-quart enameled or stainless-steel saucepan and slowly simmer or “sweat” onion, garlic, chili, galangal or ginger, lemon-grass, and chili paste for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice until onion and garlic are soft but not colored. Add chicken soup and simmer for 30 minutes. The soup can be prepared up to this point about 1 hour before serving and kept, partly covered, at room temperature. Just before serving, skim thoroughly. Remove lemongrass and add chicken, mushrooms, and fish sauce. Cook at a gentle boil for 2 to 4 minutes, then add coconut milk and lime juice. Heat but do not boil, until chicken and mushrooms are Just tender. Ladle into 4 warm, soup bowls, preferably of Asian shape, and garnish each portion with chopped scallions and cilantro. Serve each portion with ½ cup rice in a small side dish to be spooned into the soup or eaten along with it.
