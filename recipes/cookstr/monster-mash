Place the peas, water, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes. Drain and set aside ½ cup of the peas. Put the remaining peas, half-and-half, and butter in a medium bowl and blend with a stick blender or use a stand blender. Purée until smooth. Fold the whole peas into the pea purée. Pour onto the warm pasta or rice. Serve with a dish of grated cheese and extra sauce for pouring or dipping. Variations Add cooked white beans, shredded raw zucchini, or cooked bacon or chicken to the pasta. Add dried dill or dried thyme to the sauce when blending. When adding dried herbs, make sure they have time to rehydrate by adding them into hot liquid or cooking them in the sauce. Dried, crispy herbs can be unappealing to eat.
