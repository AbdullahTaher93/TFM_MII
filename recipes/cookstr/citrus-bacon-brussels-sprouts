Fry the bacon over medium heat until barely crisp. Using kitchen scissors, snip the bacon into ¼-inch pieces. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat from the pan. Add the shallots and sauté until soft. Add the chicken broth, brown ale, orange juice and zest, and brown sugar and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes on medium heat. Add the bacon and sprouts and cook for 10 minutes more, stirring frequently, until sprouts are coated with a thick sauce.
