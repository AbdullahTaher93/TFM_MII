Place the potatoes and eggs in a pot of cold salted water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the potatoes are tender (they will be easy to pierce with a skewer) and the eggs are hard cooked; 11 minutes should do it (see Note). Drain the potatoes and eggs in a colander and rinse under cold water until cool. Drain well. Cut the potatoes into ¼-inch dice, then place in a large bowl. Add the chicken, pickles, celery, olives, mayonnaise, and chopped dill and toss gently but thoroughly to mix. Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste. Shell the eggs, cut into ¼-inch dice, and add to the bowl. To serve, line plates or a platter with lettuce leaves. Arrange the tomato slices in a ring around the edge of the plate, overlapping them slightly. Mound the chicken salad in the center and decorate the top with the olives and dill sprigs.
