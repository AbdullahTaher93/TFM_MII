Put the fresh tomatoes or the canned tomatoes in purée and the carrot in a saucepan. Cook, uncovered, over gentle heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 40 minutes. If you see that the tomatoes contain a great deal of water, drain off excess liquid as the tomatoes cook. Strain the tomatoes through a food mill, pressing to get as much of the pulp as you can through the fine holes. (This really must be done in a food mill in order to restrain the skins and seeds while finely pureéing the tomatoes; avoid puréeing in the food processor because it will not restrain the peels and seeds.) If the sauce is too thin (this will depend on the texture and water content of the tomatoes), return it to the saucepan and simmer for up to 20 minutes longer. Season with salt, pepper to taste, olive oil, and basil. VARIATION: Fresh mint leaves can be substituted for the basil.
