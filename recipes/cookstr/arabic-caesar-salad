Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush the pita breads with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of the za’atar. Bake on a cookie sheet for about 5 minutes or until crisp but not browned. (If you are using matzoh, follow these directions but toast in a 200-degree oven.) Dice the tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, and onion into 1-Inch chunks and put them into a salad bowl. Add the scallions, watercress, mint, and cilantro or parsley and toss together. Put the garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Whisk in the remaining olive oil. Just before serving, pour the dressing over the vegetables and sprinkle with the remaining za’atar: Break up the pita and toss gently with the vegetables. Adjust seasonings and serve immediately.
