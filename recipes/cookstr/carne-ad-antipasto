Heat the butter and olive oil in a large saucepan. Cook the onion over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the tomatoes and veal, season well with salt and pepper, and combine. Cook over low heat for 30 minutes. Add the pumpkin and simmer for 20 minutes more, or until it is tender. Add a little water, if necessary. Serve hot or cold.
