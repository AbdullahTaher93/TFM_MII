Bring 2 cups water and the sugar to a simmer in a saucepan over low heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Increase the heat to high and boil 1–2 minutes to reduce slightly. Let cool 5 minutes, then stir in the liqueur and lemon juice. Sprinkle the gelatin over ½ cup cold water in a small heatproof bowl. Let stand about 5 minutes, until spongy. Place the bowl in a frying pan of simmering water and stir until the gelatin dissolves. Stir into the syrup. Place a 9 × 5in (22 × 13cm) nonstick loaf pan in a roasting pan. Add enough ice water to come halfway up the sides of the loaf pan. Scatter the raspberries in the bottom of the loaf pan. Add enough of the gelatin mixture to cover. Let set. Sprinkle the red currants and blueberries over the raspberry layer, and add enough of the gelatin mixture to cover. Let this layer set. Finally, add a layer of strawberries and pour in the remaining gelatin mixture. Remove the loaf pan from the water. Cover and refrigerate until completely set, at least 3 hours (preferably 8 hours). Dip the loaf pan in a bowl of hot water for a few seconds. Invert and unmold the terrine onto a platter. Serve chilled. 5. Dip the loaf pan in a bowl of hot water for a few seconds.
