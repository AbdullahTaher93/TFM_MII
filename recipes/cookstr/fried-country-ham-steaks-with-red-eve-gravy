Place the ham steaks in a large baking pan, cover with water, and soak for 20 minutes at room temperature. Drain the steaks; cut off the thick outer rind if there is one (but leave the fat for better protection and flavor); and pat dry. Melt the lard or shortening in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ham steaks, then pour in l/3 cup water. Crank the heat to medium high and bring the water to a boil. Turn the ham steaks once or twice as the water boils away. Once the water is gone, continue cooking the steaks, frying them in the residual fat, until browned in splotchy patches, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter. Pour the coffee and 3 tablespoons water into the skillet. As the mixture comes to a boil, scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet. Boil for 30 seconds, then pour into a small bowl. Use this red-eye gravy as a dip for the ham, a sop for biscuits, or a drizzle for accompanying eggs, particularly those served sunny side up.
