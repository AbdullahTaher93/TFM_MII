Put the flour, confectioners’ sugar, and butter in a food processor and process until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add 3–4 tablespoons iced water and pulse until the mixture comes together and forms a dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and bring together in a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and put in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9½-inch loose-bottomed fluted flan pan with melted butter, then place on a baking sheet. Roll out the pastry between two sheets of baking paper and line the prepared pan, trimming the edges. Line the pastry shell with a piece of crumbled baking paper, and pour in rice or beans to cover the base. Cook in the oven for 15 minutes, then remove the paper and rice and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until the pastry is cooked and lightly golden in color. Allow the pastry to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. Cut the peaches in half and remove the stones. Finely slice the peaches and arrange in a circular pattern over the pastry base. Whisk together the eggs, sugar, cream, and nutmeg. Carefully pour the mixture over the peaches. Bake in the oven for 25–30 minutes, or until the mixture is just set. Allow to cool completely before serving.
