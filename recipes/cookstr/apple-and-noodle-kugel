Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. In a large bowl, mix the noodles with the beaten eggs and 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Set aside. Grate the apples into another bowl and sprinkle with the lemon juice. Add the remaining sugar, raisins, almonds, and cinnamon and mix well. Let stand for 10 minutes. Butter a round baking dish and sprinkle with some of the bread crumbs. Arrange one third of the noodle mixture on the bottom and top with half the apple mixture. Repeat the layers, finishing with the remaining noodles. Sprinkle the top with the remaining crumbs and drizzle with the melted butter. Bake until the top is golden brown, about 50 minutes. Cool slightly and serve
