Purée the mangoes in a food processor. Strain through a wire sieve to remove any fibers. Refrigerate. Bring 1¼ cups water and the sugar to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Stir the syrup and lemon juice into the mango purèe. Beat the egg white until soft peaks form and fold into the mango mixture. Pour the mixture into a covered container and freeze for at least 4 hours, or until slushy. Mash with a fork to break up any ice crystals. Freeze until solid. (Or, pour into an ice cream machine and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to use.) Scoop into serving dishes and serve immediately. Variations: Melon Sorbet: Substitute 1 seeded and chopped cantaloupe for the mangoes. Increase the sugar to 1¼ cups. Papaya Sorbet: Substitute 2 very ripe papayas, seeded, peeled, and chopped, for the mangoes, and lime juice for the lemon juice. Increase the sugar to 1¼ cups. Blueberry Sorbet: Omit the mangoes. Add 3 cups fresh blueberries and the lemon juice to the syrup and simmer for about 4 minutes, until the berries have all burst. Let cool, then purèe.
