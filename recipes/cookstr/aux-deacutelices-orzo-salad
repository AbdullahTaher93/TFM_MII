Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Place the nuts on a baking tray and toast in the oven until light golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over high heal. Add the orzo and cook according to package directions. Drain immediately and rinse with cold water. In a medium bowl, mix the orzo with the apricots, cilantro, coriander, scallions, and pistachios. Toss with 4 tablespoons of the ginger oil to moisten the pasta. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle the fresh lemon juice on the salad and toss again. Adjust the seasoning, adding another tablespoon of ginger oil if necessary.
