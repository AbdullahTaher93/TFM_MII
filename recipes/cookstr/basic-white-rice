In a medium saucepot with a lid over high heat, combine the rice, water, and salt and bring to a boil; stir, reduce the heat to very low, cover, and simmer for 12 minutes. Lift the lid, stir the rice, replace the lid, turn off the heat, and place the covered pot in a skillet of warm water over low heat for 10 minutes to finish steaming the rice. Do not lift the lid until ready to serve.
