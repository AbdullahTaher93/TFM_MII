To make the Rémoulade Sauce: Place the garlic, celery, parsley, scallions, vinegar, paprika, salt, horseradish, mustard, ketchup, and hot sauce in a blender or the bowl of a small food processor fitted with the metal blade. Blend until combined. With the machine running, add the oil in a slow, steady stream. Continue processing until the oil is incorporated and emulsified, giving the sauce a thick, creamy consistency. Taste and add more salt, if necessary. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the sauce into an airtight container and chill for at least 30 minutes before serving, preferably a few hours or overnight. (This helps meld the flavors and mellow out the scallions.) The sauce can be made up to 3 days ahead and stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator. To make the shrimp: Place the carrots, onions, celery, bay leaf, salt, peppercorns, lemon juice, and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath with 4 cups of ice cubes and 4 cups of cold water in a large bowl. Turn off the heat, add the shrimp, cover the pot, and let sit for 5 to 6 minutes (stirring the shrimp once or twice to make sure they all get submerged in the water), or until they are white all the way through (peel one to check). Strain the shrimp through a sieve set over a bowl and place in the ice bath to cool for about 1 minute before peeling. Reserve the cooking liquid to make shrimp stock, if desired (Love Note 2). Peel the shrimp and devein them (Love Note 3), keeping the tails intact (they look more appetizing that way). Place the shrimp in a large bowl. Add about 1/3 cup of the rémoulade and gently toss to generously coat the shrimp. Allow the shrimp to marinate in the sauce for 20 minutes. To serve: Place a thin layer of lettuce on each plate. Arrange the shrimp on top of the lettuce, allowing 4 or 5 per serving. Top with the scallions and serve.
