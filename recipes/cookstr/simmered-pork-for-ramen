Trim the skin and cut the pork across the grain into several 6- to 7-inch blocks. Put the pork pieces into a large, shallow pot in which they can fit without overlapping and cover them with water. Add the garlic, ginger, salt, sake, and shoyu. Bring the mixture to a boil, and skim any foam. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover with a drop lid, and gently simmer the pork for 40 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, and let the pork stand in its cooking liquid for 15 minute. Remove the pork from the pot, and let the broth cool to room temperature. Use the pork in shoyu ramen, miso ramen, or chilled ramen (hiyashi chukasobk.) Reserve the broth for making sweet simmered bamboo shoots (menma,) another ramen topping. The broth is also an important ingredient in shoyu ramen. The pork and its broth keep for 1 week in the refrigerator, and can be frozen for later use.
