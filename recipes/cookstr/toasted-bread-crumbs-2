There is simply no reason to settle for store-bought bread crumbs when making your own is so simple, quick, and rewarding. With a hint of cheese, some simple spices, and a nice toasted crunch, these are the perfect topping for a salad and great on pasta of all kinds. Dry the bread on a cooling rack, uncovered, overnight. Pulse the dried bread in a food processor until chopped into fine crumbs. Preheat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and garlic and sauté until the garlic is lightly browned. Add the bread crumbs, reduce the heat to medium, and sauté until the crumbs take on an even brown color; do not burn. Toss the bread crumbs frequently; the process should take about 10 minutes. Transfer the bread crumbs to a plate and let cool. When the crumbs are at room temperature, combine them in a bowl with the cheese and parsley and toss to mix. Store in a tightly covered container in a cool, dry place until ready to use. They will keep for about a week.
