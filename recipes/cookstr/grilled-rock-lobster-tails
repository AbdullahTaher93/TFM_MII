Fill a 5- or 6-quart pot with about 3 quarts of water and bring to a boil. Add about ¼ cup salt, preferably sea salt, to make it taste like ocean water (or use ocean water). When the water is at a rolling boil, add the lobster tails and cook for about 3 minutes. Using tongs, remove the lobster tails from the water and let them cool to room temperature. Using a cleaver or heavy knife, cut the tails lengthwise down the center. Remove the intestinal tract. Place the tails on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until you are ready to grill them. Prepare a medium grill fire following (see Notes)—let the fire cook down so the lobster tails will cook evenly and not too fast. Clean the grill with a wire brush and wipe it with a cloth sprayed or moistened with vegetable oil. Place the lobster tails on a large plate or in a shallow pan and brush them, on both the shell and meat side, with the oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Place the tails meat side down directly over the fire. Cook for 3 minutes, and turn them over. The meat should have grill marks and some brown spots from the grill. Brush the meat with oil and continue cooking for another 5 or 6 minutes, shell side down. If the shells become charred quickly, the fire is too hot and you should move the tails to indirect heat, or the periphery of the grill. Transfer the grilled tails to a platter or plates and spoon about ¼ cup sauce over each tail. For the Ají Verde: Halve and pit the avocado, peel, and cut into ½ -inch dice. Place the avocado in a mixing bowl. Add the chopped eggs, scallions, tomato, lemon juice, jalapeño, cilantro, garlic, and olive oil and mix with a fork to create a creamy, chunky paste. Season with the salt and a little pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. This sauce tastes best the day it is made, but you can make it in the morning and serve later in the day.
