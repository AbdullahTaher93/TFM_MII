Cook the butter in a heavy small saucepan over medium heat until melted and beginning to simmer (do not stir). Remove from the heat. Spoon off the foam from atop the butter. Carefully pour the clarified butter into a small bowl, leaving the liquid whey and milk solids behind. Cool the clarified butter. Cover tightly and refrigerate.
