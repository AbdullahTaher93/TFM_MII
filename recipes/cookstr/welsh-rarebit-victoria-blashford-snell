Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Position the broiler rack 4in (10cm) from the heat, and preheat. Toast the bread on both sides until golden brown. Transfer the toast to the baking sheet. Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add the cheese, ale, and mustard and cook, stirring often, until the cheese is melted and smooth. Pour the sauce over the toast. Splash a few drops of Worcestershire sauce on each. Return the cheese-covered toast to the broiler for a few minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling and golden. Cut each slice in half and serve. Variation Golden Bucks: Prepare the recipe as above, preferably using Lancashire cheese instead of Cheddar. Add a poached or fried egg to the top of each toast, just before serving.
