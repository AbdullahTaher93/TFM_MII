Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Combine the yeast and warm water with a wire whisk, and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the sugar, salt, olive oil, and flour with the yeast mixture for about 1 minute, or until combined. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes. Turn the dough onto a floured board, and knead about 15 times. Cut into desired portions. Place the dough on a nonstick baking pan. Top as desired and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the topping is warmed through.
