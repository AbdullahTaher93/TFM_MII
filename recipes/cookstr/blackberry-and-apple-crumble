Either way, when it has reached this texture, mix in the brown sugar. Put your blackberries and apples into a pie dish and dot them with the 1 tablespoon or butter and the sugar. Cover the fruit with the crumble and bake it in the oven for about 30 minutes until the fruit is bubbling up and the crumble is a rich golden brown. Serve with custard or creme fraiche.
