Combine the bulgur wheat, boiling water, lemon zest and juice, and olive oil in a bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Fluff the bulgur mixture with a fork. Add the parsley, mint, scallions, garlic, and salt and pepper. Toss well with the fork. Add the tomatoes and cucumbers, and toss again. Adjust the seasonings if necessary. Let the salad stand, loosely covered, at room temperature for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to blend. Garnish the salad with the mint sprig, and serve at room temperature.
