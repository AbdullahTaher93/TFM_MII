Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, agave nectar and butter until well blended. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just blended. Gently fold in zucchini and pecans. Divide batter equally among prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes, then transfer to the rack to cool.
