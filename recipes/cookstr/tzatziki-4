Yogurt Cheese: Line a sieve with cheesecloth or a paper coffee filter set over a medium-size bowl. Spoon yogurt into sieve. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Then, gather edges of cheesecloth together and gently squeeze out any remaining whey liquid (see Notes). (You should have about 1 cup/250 mL cheese.) Transfer to a bowl. Drain and squeeze liquid from cucumber with your hands. Stir cucumber, garlic and dill into yogurt cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Stir just before serving. Tzatziki keeps well refrigerated for up to one week. Pita Chips: Cut 4 (6-inch/15 cm) pita breads into 8 wedges each. Brush lightly with olive oil. Bake on a baking sheet in a 350°F (180°C) oven for 5 minutes or until crisp. Allow to cool then store in a plastic bag. Makes 32 pieces.
