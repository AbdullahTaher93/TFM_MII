Cut the tomatoes into quarters. Using a small sharp knife, carefully remove and discard the core, pulp, and seeds. Cut the tomatoes into small dice and place in a small mixing bowl. Add the garlic, parsley, and oregano, tossing to blend. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside to marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour before using.
