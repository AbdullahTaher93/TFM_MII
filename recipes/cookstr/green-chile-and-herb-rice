In a food processor, combine chiles, cilantro, garlic and oil and process until smooth with a little texture, 1 to 2 minutes. In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine rice and chile mixture. Mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on High for 1 minute. Remove and stir. Repeat until rice is heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.
