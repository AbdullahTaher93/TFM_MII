Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Fill a medium saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lightly grease a 9-inch square baking pan with the olive oil. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 4 wedges. When the water boils, add the potatoes and blanch for 3 minutes. Drain the potatoes well in a colander and transfer to the prepared baking pan. Trim the nibs off the top of the garlic cloves (but do not peel them), and add the cloves to the potatoes. Sprinkle on the rosemary and dot with butter. Season with salt and pepper. Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes. Turn the potatoes and bake for 15 minutes more or until browned all over and cooked through.
