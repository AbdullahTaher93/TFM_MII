Preheat the oven to 350°F. Oil an 8 × 4-inch loaf pan. In a heavy skillet over medium heat, sauté the celery and onion in the butter until soft. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool for 5 minutes. Add the meats, parsley, sour cream, bread crumbs, thyme, marjoram, and salt and pepper to the skillet. Whisk the egg with the Worcestershire sauce and add to the mixture. Using a wooden spoon or your hands, combine the mixture and mold into a loaf shape. Place the meat loaf in the prepared loaf pan. Top with the chili sauce and bacon slices. Place in the oven on a jelly roll pan to catch any drips. Bake until cooked through and nicely browned, 1 hour.
