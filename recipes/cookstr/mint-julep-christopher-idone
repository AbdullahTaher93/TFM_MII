In a blender, combine the mint and Simple Syrup, mixing until pureed thoroughly.Place half of the mint mixture and 1 straw in each julep cup. Packing the ice around the straw, fill the cup almost to the top with shaved ice. Set the cups in the freezer for at least 30 minutes. Touching the outside as little as possible, remove the cups from the freezer and pour scotch over the shaved ice.Decorate with mint sprigs and sip in the shade.
