Put all the ingredients into a large pot and add enough cold water to cover completely. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes, skimming any foam that forms on the surface as needed. Strain the stock, discarding the solids. Rinse out the pot, then return the stock to it and simmer for about 15 minutes longer. Cool to room temperature: then refrigerate or freeze in several containers.
