Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500Â°F. On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the dough to a 8-inch round and brush the inner circle with the Chili and Garlic Oil. Bake the dough until it is very lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the dough from the oven and while it is still on the peel or rimless baking tray, brush the dough with the Pesta, arrange the sliced tomatoes on the pizza, and top with the grilled vegetables, oregano, and thyme. Return the pizza to the oven and bake until crust is nicely browned, 6 to 7 more minutes. Carefully remove the pizza from the oven and transfer onto a firm surface. To serve, garnish with the basil, cut into slices, and serve immediately.
