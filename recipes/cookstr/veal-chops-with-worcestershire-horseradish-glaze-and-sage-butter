Mash the butter and sage together in a small bowl with a fork. Season with salt and pepper and mix well. Scrape the butter mixture onto a piece of waxed paper, using the waxed paper to help you form the butter into a log. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Stir together the Worcestershire, maple syrup, and horseradish in another small bowl. Add pepper to taste. This glaze can be made up to 2 days in advance. If you make it ahead, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes. Brush the veal chops with the oil. Liberally season them with salt and pepper. Place the chops on the grill, close the lid, and cook for about 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, turn the chops over, and continue cooking for another 8 minutes. During the last 5 minutes, spoon on the glaze. The chops are done when they give easily to the touch and register about 140Â°F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the chops from the grill and top each with about a tablespoon of the sage butter. Allow the chops to rest and the butter to start melting for about 5 minutes. Serve with any additional glaze on the side.
