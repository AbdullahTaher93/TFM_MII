Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream butter with granulated and brown sugars until fluffy; beat in eggs and vanilla until smooth. In another bowl, stir together flour, baking soda and salt. Beat into creamed mixture until combined; stir in chocolate chips. Drop by tablespoonfuls (15 mL) about 2 inches (5 cm) apart onto cookie sheets. Bake one sheet at time on middle rack in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are firm. (Bake for the shorter time if you prefer cookies with a soft chewy center.) Cool for 2 minutes on baking sheets; remove to wire rack and cool completely.
