Drizzle the oil in a heavy 3-quart soup pot and swirl it around until the oil coats the entire surface. Heat over high heat until hot. Add the onion, carrot, celery, oregano, bay leaves, and garlic. Cook and stir until tender but not brown. Add the undrained tomatoes, the Basic Vegetable Stock, and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmering and cook for 45 minutes. Remove soup pot from heat. Stir in half of the basil. Cool for 15 minutes. Ladle soup into a blender a little at a time and blend until pureed. (Be very careful because hot liquids in a blender can be explosive when you turn on the blender.) Once all the soup is blended, return soup to pot. Or use an immersion blender to blend the soup right in the soup pot. Sprinkle each serving with some of the remaining basil. If you like, top with Parmesan cheese.
