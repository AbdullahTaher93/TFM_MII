Cut a pocket in the top of the salmon fillet. Season the fillet with ½ teaspoon of the kosher salt and all of the black pepper. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to cook. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat ¼ cup of the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, bell pepper, celery, basil, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley and sauté until the vegetables are tender and lightly browned. Add the spinach and green onions and cook for 1 minute more. Add the wine and ¼ cup of the clam juice and cook until the liquid has reduced by half Add the scallops and shrimp and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and fold in half of the bread crumbs, the lemon juice, and the remaining 1/2 easpoon salt. Transfer the shrimp mixture to a shallow pan, spread out evenly across the pan, and refrigerate until cool. When cool, remove the shrimp filling and the salmon from the refrigerator. Lightly grease a small roasting pan. Stuff the pocket in the salmon fillet with the filling, and press the crabmeat in on top of the filling. Place the salmon into the pan and sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs on top, allowing a portion to drop off onto the pan. Drizzle with the remaining ¼ cup olive oil. Pour the remaining 2¼ cups clam juice around the salmon and cover the pan with aluminum foil. Bake the salmon for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, or until the breading is golden brown. The salmon should be cooked to medium and the filling should be hot. Center the fish on a serving platter and pour the sauce around the dish. Garnish with the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.
