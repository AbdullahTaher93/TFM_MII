Place the mayonnaise, parsley, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, Old Bay seasoning, and egg in a large mixing bowl and mix with a fork until the egg is well incorporated. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Gently fold in the crab and 2 tablespoons of the panko until the mixture just comes together and is still fairly loose. Form 24 small crab cakes, 1½ to 2 inches in diameter, and place them on a parchment paper- or waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator to chill for about 30 minutes. When you are ready to fry the crab cakes, preheat the oven to 300°F. Dust the crab cakes on both sides with the remaining heaping cup of panko crumbs and set aside the baking sheet. Place the olive oil and vegetable oil in a large frying pan and heat over medium-high heat until hot. Working in batches, carefully slide the crab cakes into the hot oil and cook until lightly browned on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. As the crab cakes finish cooking, transfer them to paper towels to drain. Remove the parchment paper or waxed paper from the baking sheet and place the drained crab cakes on the sheet. When all of the crab cakes are cooked, place the baking sheet in the oven to keep warm, preferably for only 20 minutes but they can be kept warm for up to an hour. To serve, carefully transfer the hot crab cakes to a serving platter. Garnish the platter with the lemon wedges and sprinkle capers or chopped parsley over the crab cakes.
