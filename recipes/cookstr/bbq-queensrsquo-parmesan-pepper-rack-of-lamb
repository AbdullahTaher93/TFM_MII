Trim off the flap of fat covering the outside of each frenched rack of lamb. Place the cheese, garlic, basil, oregano, and peppercorns in a bowl and stir to mix. Stir in enough oil to create a thick paste. Generously season the racks on both sides with salt. Spread the herb paste on the racks on both sides, using the back of a spoon. Let the racks marinate for 15 minutes at room temperature while you light the grill. Set up the grill and preheat to medium-high. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Be exceptionally generous with the oil, as the cheese in the herb paste tends to stick to the grate. Place the racks in the center of the hot grate, meat side up, over the drip pan and away from the heat, and cover the grill. Cook 25 to 40 minutes per side for medium-rare, about 145°F on an instant-read meat thermometer (the cooking time will depend on the size of the racks). Transfer the racks to a platter and let them rest for 3 minutes. Carve the lamb into chops and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over the meat. 4.
