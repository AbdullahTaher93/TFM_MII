In a heavy 6 quart soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in the Italian seasoning and garlic and cook for 20 seconds. Stir in the broth and the farro. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce the heat slightly, and cook for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and squash them against the side of the pot with a large spoon. Stir in the cannellini and zucchini. Cover and cook over medium heat until the farro and zucchini are tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Stir in the parsley, cheese, remaining tablespoon of oil, and salt and pepper to taste. If needed, balance the flavors with a bit of balsamic and sugar.
