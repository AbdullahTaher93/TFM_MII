Preheat the oven to 400°F. Cut the potatoes into lengthwise quarters, and then cut each piece in half crosswise. Place them in a bowl and toss with the olive oil, paprika, and salt and pepper. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until tender in the center and brown and crisp on the outside, about 30 minutes, shaking them once while they are cooking. Carefully remove the fries from the baking sheet with a metal spatula and pile them on a platter. Sprinkle with a little extra coarse salt, if desired, and serve immediately. Pass the aïoli.
