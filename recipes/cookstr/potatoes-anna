Peel the potatoes and slice them into very thin, even rounds, 1/8 inch thick. You can do this more easily if you use a vegetable slicer with an adjustable blade. As the potatoes are sliced, drop them into a large bowl of salted ice water until ready to use. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 400Â°. The best thing to use for baking is a heavy 8-inch cast-iron skillet, 2 inches deep. Lacking this, use a deep 8-inch round pie dish or baking dish of the same dimensions. Brush the bottom and sides of the skillet heavily with melted butter. Drain the potatoes and dry them thoroughly on clean cloth or paper towels. They must be completely dry, as excess moisture would ruin the dish. Arrange layer of potatoes in the bottom of the skillet: put one slice in the center and arrange overlapping circles of potatoes around it, from center to sides. Sprinkle the potatoes very lightly with salt and pepper and spoon a tablespoon or two of melted butter over them. Continue to make layers of potatoes, seasoning each layer and spooning butter over it, until the pan is filled. Spoon another tablespoon or two of butter over the top. Put the skillet or dish on the center shelf of the oven and a baking sheet on the shelf below it to catch any butter that might bubble over. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, until the potatoes are crisp and brown around the edges and tender when prodded with a fork or toothpick. Remove the pan from the oven. Run a knife around the edge of the potatoes to loosen them. Put a large flat serving platter, big enough to hold the potato cake, on top of the pan and quickly invert it so the cake unmolds itself onto the platter. To serve, cut into wedges. Serve potatoes Anna with steak, roast meats, or chicken.
