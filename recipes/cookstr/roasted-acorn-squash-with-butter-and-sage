Preheat the oven to 400°F. Cut each squash lengthwise through the stem into 8 wedges. Use a spoon to scrape out the seeds from the wedges. Arrange the squash pieces on a big baking pan or your broiler pan, skin side down, and season the flesh generously with salt. Drizzle the butter over the flesh and scatter the sage leaves all over. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and cook for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and roast until you can easily pierce a piece of the squash with a fork and meet almost no resistance, about 20 minutes. Serve as is, shriveled sage leaves and all. You can bake the squash up to a few hours in advance. Reheat for about 15 minutes in an oven preheated to 350°F before serving.
