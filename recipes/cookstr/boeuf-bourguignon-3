Cut the bacon into ¼- to ½-inch squares. Place in a Dutch oven or large heavy pot, and cook over medium heat until browned and crisp, about 25 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat in the pot. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Arrange the meat in a single layer and brown over high heat. (Browning may need to be done in 2 or more batches depending on the size of the pan.) Once all the meat has been browned, add the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour, stir well, and cook for about 5 minutes, until browned. Stir in the tomato paste and deglaze the pan by adding the wine, making sure to scrape up all the brown bits with a wooden spoon. Add the stock, carrot, onions, mushrooms, half of the browned bacon, 1 teaspoon salt, a pinch of pepper, and the bouquet garni. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cover. After 1½ to 2 hours, once the meat begins to get tender, crack the lid an inch or two so the sauce can thicken. (Depending on the amount of liquid in the pan, the lid may be taken off completely.) Continue to cook for a total of 2½ to 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is very tender, and the sauce has thickened. Garnish with the remaining bacon and chopped parsley.
