If you are using frozen shrimp, set them out on the counter while you prepare the other ingredients. If you are using “fresh” shrimp, run them under cold water while you use your fingers to peel off the shells. Use the tip of a small sharp knife to score the back and front, pull out the thick white vein and the thin black one, and refrigerate. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and add the onion and green pepper. Sauté over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes, or until the onion is slightly browned. Stir in the garlic. Add the rice, tomatoes, liquid, and chili powder. Mix to combine, and when the liquid starts to boil, lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 40 minutes. If you don’t have a lid large enough for the pan, use heavy-duty foil and tuck it securely around the edges. While the rice is cooking, cut the broccoli into 1-inch pieces. At the end of 40 minutes, add the shrimp and the broccoli to the rice. Stir just to mix. Cover and cook an additional 6 to 7 minutes, or until the shrimp are bright pink and the broccoli is just tender. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and add the onion and green pepper.
