1 Chop the lemongrass, reserving the fleshy center. Cut lime leaves into thin ribbons. Using a mortar and pestle, bruise lemongrass, lime leaves, garlic, galangal or ginger, Thai chiles, and sea salt into a thick paste and set aside. 2 Heat coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook for 2 minutes. Add chile paste and stir for 30 seconds. 3 Add vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add buckwheat noodles and cook for 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and add coconut aminos, agave nectar or maple syrup, lime juice, tomatoes, and broccoli. Cover and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, or until broccoli is bright green. Add snow peas, cover, and simmer for 1 minute. Stir in cilantro and serve immediately.
