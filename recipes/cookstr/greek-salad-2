Remove and discard the outer leaves of the head of romaine lettuce. Chop the lettuce and transfer to a colander. There should be about 8 cups. Rinse under cold water, shake or spin dry, and set aside to drain completely. In a salad bowl, combine the rinsed onion, cucumber, and feta. Add the lettuce and oregano. Toss with the olive oil and vinegar, if using. Season to taste with salt, if desired. Serve immediately.
