Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Quarter each radicchio lengthwise. Be sure to leave the cores intact so that you end up with wedges that are held together at the base. Place the radicchio wedges in a roasting dish or a skillet, anything that will hold them in an even layer and that can go into the oven. Drizzle with the olive oil and pour in the water. Tightly cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil and roast in the oven until tender when pierced with a paring knife, about 20 minutes. Transfer the radicchio to a serving dish and sprinkle with a large pinch of salt. Scatter the pine nuts and currants over the radicchio, and drizzle with the balsamic vinegar. Serve warm or at room temperature.
