In a medium-size bowl, using a wooden spoon, beat the butter until creamy. Add the herbs, garlic, and pepper and stir until smooth. Spoon the butter onto a sheet of plastic wrap into a 4-inch-long log. Roll up the plastic, forming the butter into a cylinder. Twist the ends tightly to press the butter into a compact log. Refrigerate until chilled. Will keep refrigerated for about 1 week or frozen for 1 month.
