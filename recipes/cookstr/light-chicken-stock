Pull off as much of the fat and skin from the backs and necks as possible. Combine the chicken, carrots, onion, and garlic in a 5-quart stockpot. Pour in enough cold water to cover the chicken by 1 inch (about 3 quarts). Heat over high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and boil 5 minutes. Skim all the foam and fat that rise to the surface. Adjust the heat to a bare simmerâ€“1 or 2 bubbles rising to the surface at a time. Simmer until the bones fall apart when poked with a fork, about 8 hours. Check the pot occasionally, skimming the foam and fat as it rises to the surface, and adding water as needed to keep the bones submerged. Ladle the stock through a sieve lined with a double thickness of cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel into a bowl. Quickly cool to room temperature. Refrigerate, uncovered, until completely chilled and a layer of firm fat forms on top. Remove the fat from the surface. Render the chicken fat, if desired (see box). Warm the stock over low heat and ladle into 1-cup storage containers with tight-fitting lids. Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Heat to a boil before using.
