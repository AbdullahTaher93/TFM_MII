Pluck the cilantro leaves off the stalks; finely chop the stalks and reserve the leaves. Heat the oil and butter in a large deep frying pan over low heat. Add the shallots and chile and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, or until they start to turn golden. Then, stir in the curry paste and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the rice, lime zest, and cilantro stalks. Stir for 1 minute, until the rice is well coated. Stir in the coconut milk, 1Â¾ cups water, and the salt. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle in the kaffir leaf and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Stir the rice and cover. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender. If the liquid has been absorbed but the rice is still not tender, add a little more water. When ready to serve, stir in the scallions and sprinkle with the reserved cilantro leaves. Serve hot.
