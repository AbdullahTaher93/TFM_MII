To make the purée, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut the rhubarb into short pieces and put it in an ovenproof dish. Scatter over the sugar, then add the orange juice and bake for twenty to twenty-five minutes, until it is soft enough to crush (you could cook it over medium heat, if you prefer). Mash with a fork. While the rhubarb is cooking, peel the apples, core them, and cook with a couple of tablespoons of water, no sugar, over medium heat. Crush to a purée with a fork. To make the brittle, tip the nuts into a shallow pan and toast over high heat for a minute or two, until golden. Put the sugar into a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan with the water and bring to a boil. Leave to bubble fiercely, without stirring, until the syrup changes to a rich brown. Tip in the toasted nuts, then pour the mixture carefully onto a lightly oiled nonstick baking sheet and leave to harden. Smash the brittle into small pieces and set aside. Serve the two crushed fruits mixed together, scattered with broken almond brittle. Smash the brittle into small pieces and set aside.
