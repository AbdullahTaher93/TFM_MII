To make the crust: Measure the flour, baking powder, and salt into a sifter. In the bowl of an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat together the butter and sugar for 4 minutes. Add the egg and the vanilla and beat well. Sift the flour over the creamed mixture and beat for a minute, or just until combined. Spray a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Line it with foil, allowing the foil to hang over each end of the pan, and spray the foil with cooking spray. Press the dough evenly into the pan and refrigerate the pan for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake the crust for about 25 minutes or until golden, rotating the pan once halfway through the baking time. Remove from the oven but leave the oven on. To make the topping: Place the pecans on a baking sheet in a single layer and toast in the oven alongside the crust for 5 to 8 minutes, until golden. When cool, chop in a food processor or by hand. Measure the sugar into a heavy 3-quart saucepan and turn the heat to medium. When it starts to melt and turn golden, stir it occasionally. Continue to cook, stirring, and the sugar will completely melt and turn light brown. Carefully add the cream and don’t worry when the mixture steams up! Stir well and cook for 30 seconds or until the mixture is smooth and liquid. Cut the butter into little pieces. Add it to the caramel mixture along with the vanilla and salt. Stir in the chopped pecans. Pour the mixture over the partially cooled crust. Bake for 20 minutes. When it is bubbly but still jiggly, remove from the oven and cool in pan on wire rack for 2 hours. Flip the entire pan over onto a large cutting board to remove the cookies from the pan. Peel off the foil and turn right side up. Using a sharp knife, cut into 24 bars. Cut each bar in half on the diagonal. Store in an airtight container at room temperature, between layers of waxed paper for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.
