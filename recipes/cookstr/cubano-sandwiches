Stir the garlic, onion, cumin, and salt and pepper together in a small bowl. Heat the 1/3 cup olive oil in a small heavy saucepan over low heat. Add the onion mixture and cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent, 10 minutes. Add the lime juice and vinegar and simmer over low heat to mellow the flavors, 5 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool slightly and spoon and brush it on the inside of both halves of each roll, distributing the onions evenly. Dab the bottom half of each roll with about 1 teaspoon of the mustard. Layer each with 3 slices of cheese, then some pickle slices, 2 slices of ham, and 3 slices of pork. Cover with the top of the roll. Heat 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Place 2 sandwiches, bottom side down, in the skillet and weight them down with the lid of a cast-iron pot. Cook until the sandwiches are browned on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn the sandwiches over, weight them down, and cook until that side is browned and the cheese has melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches, adding more oil to the skillet as needed. Cut the sandwiches in half on the diagonal, and serve them wrapped in large paper napkins.
