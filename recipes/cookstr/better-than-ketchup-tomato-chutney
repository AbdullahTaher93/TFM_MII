Heat the oil with the curry leaves (if using), mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and chiles in a large pot or skillet over medium-high heat until the cumin is browned, about 2 minutes. Add the turmeric and cook until the chiles darken, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add the remaining ingredients and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and pressing the tomatoes against the sides of the pot to mash them if they are not breaking up on their own. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the chutney is thick and jammy (if canning, cook until the mixture is very thick), stirring often, an additional 20 to 35 minutes. If you are using hard winter tomatoes, the chutney may cook in less time, as there is less tomato juice to reduce. Taste for seasoning, transfer to a covered plastic container, and refrigerate for up to 1 week or ladle into dry and sterilized jars and can according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
