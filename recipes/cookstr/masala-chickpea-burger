In a food processor, blend the chickpeas and rice until well combined. Add the remaining ingredients and process again until smooth. With your hands, form the mixture into small balls and flatten them into patties. If the dough is too sticky and soft, just add a little more gram flour. Set aside on a tray. In a shallow frying pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the patties and heat until browned on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. I like to put a lid on the pan and cook for an additional minute on each side to make sure the patties and the gram flour are cooked through. Serve on a hamburger bun with all the fixings, or on a large lettuce leaf for a lighter meal.
