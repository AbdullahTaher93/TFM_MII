Whisk the egg and buttermilk together in a shallow dish. In another shallow dish, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne. Dredge the fish fillets first in the buttermilk mixture and then in the seasoned flour. Shake off any excess and repeat until all the fish is evenly coated on both sides. Heat 4 inches of oil in a deep pot until a deep-fat thermometer registers 360Â°F. Fry the fish for 3 to 4 minutes, until the crust is golden brown, making sure the entire fillet is submerged in the oil. Drain on paper towels before serving with Tartar Sauce. To Make the Tartar Sauce: Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl and refrigerate until needed. The sauce will keep, covered and refrigerated, for 3 to 4 days.
