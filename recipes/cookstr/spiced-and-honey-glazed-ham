Preheat the oven to 325°F. In a small bowl, stir together the honey and the spice mixture. With a sharp knife, make a series of cuts, ½ inch deep and ½ inch apart, the entire length of the ham. Rotate the ham 90 degrees and make a second series of cuts, the same depth and the same distance apart, across the width of the ham. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the ham on the pan. Bake, basting every 15 minutes with the honey mixture, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 150°F, 1 to 1¼ hours. Remove the ham from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Carve the ham across the grain into slices of desired thickness. Arrange on a platter and drizzle with any remaining honey mixture.
