Using a cleaver or a heavy knife, chop the chicken wings at the joints. (Or ask the butcher to chop them for you.) Place the wings in a large saucepan and add 2 quarts of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Add the scallions, ginger, garlic, and peppercorns.

Refrigerate until chilled, at least 3 hours. Using a large spoon, scrape off the fat that rises to the surface. (The stock can be prepared, covered and refrigerated, for 2 days before serving.) 3.
