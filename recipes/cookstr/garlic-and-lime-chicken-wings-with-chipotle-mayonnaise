COOKER: Medium or large round or oval SETTING AND COOK TIME: HIGH for 3 to 4 hours Rinse the wings and pat dry. To make the marinade, place the cumin seeds in a small skillet and toast over medium heat until golden and fragrant, shaking the pan to assure even toasting. Remove from the skillet and crush in a mortar with a pestle. Combine the crushed cumin seeds with the remaining marinade ingredients in a large shallow bowl and whisk to combine. Add the wings, in a single layer if possible, so they sit in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours. Coat the inside of the crock with nonstick cooking spray. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Lift the chicken out of the marinade, reserving the marinade, and brown it nicely in the hot skillet, 3 to 5 minutes per side, in batches if necessary. As the wings brown, transfer them to the slow cooker. Pour over the reserved marinade. Cover and cook on HIGH for 3 to 4 hours. If possible, stir gently halfway through cooking with a wooden spoon, bringing the wings on the top to the bottom to coat with sauce. To make the chipotle mayonnaise, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until smooth, or pulse a few times in a food processor for a smoother sauce; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve the wings hot or warm, with the chipotle mayonnaise for dipping.
