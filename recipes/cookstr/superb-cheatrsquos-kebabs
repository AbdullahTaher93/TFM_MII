Preheat a barbecue grill or griddle pan. Remove the skins from the pork and leek sausages by slitting lengthways and peeling off. Mould each sausage around a stick of rosemary, almost squashing the meat on â€“ try to leave finger marks. Put a handful of the fresh thyme leaves in a pestle and mortar and pound a little, adding the olive oil. Roll the sausages in the thyme and oil, and whack them on the grill or griddle pan for 10 minutes, turning occasionally until golden and cooked. Grate the cucumber into a bowl, stir in the yogurt and season with salt and pepper and lemon juice. Drizzle this over your cooked kebabs and enjoy!
