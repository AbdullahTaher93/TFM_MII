Pour one bottle of the root beer evenly into an ice cube tray and freeze. Chill the other bottle. When you’re ready to serve, process half the ice cubes in the food processor until you have small shards of frozen root beer. Be careful to get all the syrup out of the ice cube tray: some of it will sink to the bottom and melt. If you’re mixing in the cream, add half of it now. Repeat the procedure with the remaining frozen root beer and cream, if using. Pile the frozen root beer into tall glasses and either pour the cream, if using, over it, followed by the chilled root beer, or just pour in the chilled root beer. Serve immediately.
