Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly grease a roasting pan with olive oil. Squeeze the juice from the lemon into a bowl filled with 1 quart water and drop the rinds into the bowl. One at a time, trim the artichokes: Snap off the thick dark green leaves until you reach the inner core of thin light green leaves; discard the leaves. Using a sharp knife, cut off the core of leaves where it meets the heart (there is often an indentation at this point), to reveal the heart. Using a dessert spoon, scoop out the fuzzy choke. Using a sharp paring knife, trim off all the dark green skin from the artichoke heart and stem. Place the trimmed artichoke hearts in the lemon water as you go. Drain the artichokes and toss with the oil in the roasting pan. Add ¼ cup hot water and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and continue roasting until the artichokes are tinged with gold and tender when pierced with a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Let the artichokes cool, then cut into ½-inch cubes. Squeeze the softened flesh from the garlic skins into a medium bowl. Mash the garlic with a fork. Stir in the chopped artichokes, ricotta, Parmesan, bell pepper, and basil. Season with salt and red pepper flakes. Cover tightly and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour, or up to 2 days. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve chilled.
