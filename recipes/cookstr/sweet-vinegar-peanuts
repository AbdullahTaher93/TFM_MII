Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange the peanuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast until the skins are lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a bowl. Set aside. To prepare the syrup, combine the cilantro, mint, vinegar, brown sugar, salt, and sesame seeds, if using, in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is syrupy and reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Pour the syrup over the peanuts and stir to coat evenly. Serve warm or at room temperature.
