In a heavy 3-quart saucepan, melt the sugar to a golden brown. It will continue to cook and darken, so donâ€™t let it get too brown. Add the heavy cream. Be careful as the mixture will bubble up. Stir it down, then simmer it until it is reduced by half. Cool and put into a squirt bottle for drizzling under or over desserts.
