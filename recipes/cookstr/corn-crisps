Mix the cornmeal and boiling water and set aside to cool. When it’s cold, beat in the egg whites, salt to taste, pepper, and cumin. You may need to add a little more water to make a thick paste. Preheat the oven to 300°F. Generously butter a baking sheet and drop the batter onto it by the soupspoonful. Bake 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Serve immediately; these don’t keep very well.
