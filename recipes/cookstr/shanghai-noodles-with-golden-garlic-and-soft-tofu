Bring 1Â½ cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the basil and mint stems, cover, and remove from the heat. Let sit for 5 minutes, then strain through a finemesh sieve. Return the strained liquid to the saucepan and discard the solids. Stir in the chicken stock and salt and set aside. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, about 4 minutes. Add the chiles and reserved herb stock, and turn the heat to low. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook just until tender, but still chewy, about 3 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water just to separate the noodles, drain again, and add to the garlic mixture. Stir in the pea shoots and sliced basil and remove from the heat. Divide the noodles among four serving bowls and spoon the sauce from the pan over the noodles. Top with a block of tofu, drizzle lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle with fleur de sel. Serve immediately.
