To extract water from the zucchini, place it in a colander and press it down against the perforated surface. Combine the zucchini, eggs, onions, allspice, salt, and cinnamon, if desired, in a medium mixing bowl. Mix well. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. When the oil sizzles upon contact with a droplet of water, drop 1 tablespoon of the egg batter into the pan. Flatten the mound of batter slightly with the back of a spoon. Continue adding as many mounds of the batter as the skillet will allow. Fry for 2 minutes, or until golden, turning once. Drain the fritters on paper towels. Repeat this process with the remaining batter, and if necessary, add more oil.
