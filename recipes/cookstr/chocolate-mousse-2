In a small saucepan, stir together sugar, cocoa, water and coffee granules; cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until smooth and thickened. Beat egg yolks; whisk into cocoa mixture and cook for about 1 minute. Let cool. Meanwhile, in a clean bowl, using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt on high speed until stiff peaks form. Stir orange-flavored liqueur into cooled cocoa mixture Fold in egg whites. Spoon into glass dishes, demitasse cups or wine glasses Sprinkle with toasted almonds. This recipe contains raw egg whites. If the food safety of raw eggs is a concern for you, use pasteurized eggs. Many grocery stores now carry pasteurized eggs in their shells.
