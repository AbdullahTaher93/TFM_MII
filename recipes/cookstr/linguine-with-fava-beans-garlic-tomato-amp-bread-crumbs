Put a large pot of water on to boil and salt it well. Meanwhile, heat the grapeseed oil over high heat. After a minute, add the garlic. Cook it, stirring occasionally, for a minute or two, just until it is fragrant. Add the favas and stir or toss to coat them in the oil. After 30 seconds, add the vegetable broth (carefully, in one big addition) to cool the pan down. Stir or shake the pan, then wait for the broth to come to a boil and add the tomato sauce, a teaspoon of salt, and the red pepper flakes. Drop the pasta into the boiling water to cook and add the butter to the sauce. Drain the pasta and add it to the warm sauce. Turn off the heat and toss the pasta to coat it in the sauce. Portion the pasta among serving bowls and garnish with the olive oil, grated cheese, and bread crumbs. Offer black pepper at the table.
