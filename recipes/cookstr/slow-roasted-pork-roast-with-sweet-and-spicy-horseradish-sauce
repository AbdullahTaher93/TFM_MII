Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the pork in a large roasting pan. Pierce the skin and fat of the pork—without going through to the meat—all over with a fork and set aside. Mix together the cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, pepper jelly, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt in a bowl and stir until well blended. Brush the pork generously with the basting liquid and add about 2 cups water to the bottom of the pan. Cover and place in the oven to roast for 5½ to 6 hours, basting frequently, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 220 to 225 degrees, the skin is browned and crisp, and the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender. Let rest for 20 to 30 minutes before serving. To serve, remove the skin, pull the pork into large pieces, and serve with the horseradish sauce. To Make the Sweet and Spicy Horseradish Saucee: Combine the horseradish, pepper jelly, vinegar, and pepper in a bowl and whisk until well blended. Spoon the sauce on top of the pulled pork or refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use. This sauce can be made 4 to 5 days in advance. It’s delicious on sandwiches and most pork and lamb dishes.
