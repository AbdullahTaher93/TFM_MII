Have ready 2 cookie sheets. Combine applesauce, cinnamon, and ginger in a large bowl until spices are completely incorporated and mixture is stiff enough to roll out. Add more cinnamon if necessary. Roll dough out to Â¼-inch thickness on surface lightly sprinkled with cinnamon. Cut out shapes of your choice; insert end of a chopstick in top of each ornament and swirl around until a hole is formed. You can also use a drinking straw. Transfer to cookie sheets and allow to dry 12 hours or overnight. Gently turn over, dry for 12 more hours, and repeat until completely hard and dry. Drying process might take a few days. Thread ribbon through hole and knot about 1 inch from the ends. They are now ready to hang.
