Arrange the beets in a single layer in a microwave-safe shallow dish. Add the water, cover with microwave-safe plastic wrap, and cook in a microwave at full power for 8 minutes. The beets will be hot and barely cooked; this step makes it easier to peel them without losing a lot of their juice. Hold under cold running water until the beets are cool enough to handle. Trim off the tough stem ends of the beets, peel with a vegetable peeler, and cut the beets into quarters Put in a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Mix the orange juice, oil, half of the garlic, ½ teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper in a small bowl. Pour over the beets and toss to coat. Cover the cooker and cook for 2 to 3 hours on high, or 4 to 5 hours on low, until the beets are fork-tender. While the beets are cooking, toast the walnuts in a small dry skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until lightly browned and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Cool briefly and chop finely. Chop the remaining garlic and mix with the walnuts, orange zest, the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, and the parsley; set aside. Remove the beets from the cooker with a slotted spoon and place in a serving bowl. Sprinkle the walnut gremolata on top and serve.
