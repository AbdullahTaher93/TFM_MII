Preheat the oven to 375°F and set a rack to the middle position. Prepare each apple by first slicing off the top ¾ inch, stem and all. Set aside the tops. Core the apples with an apple corer, then arrange in an ungreased baking dish. Divide the pecans and cranberries among the apples, stuffing them into the hollowed-out cores. Cover with the reserved tops. In a small bowl, stir together the cider and brown sugar. Pour around the apples, then add the cinnamon sticks to the pan. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake. Check the apples every 5 minutes to check for doneness. They will be done when tender (test by poking with a sharp knife), but not yet splitting their skins. They should need about 15 more minutes total. Transfer the apples to individual serving bowls and let cool for a few minutes. Remove the cinnamon sticks from the pan, and pour the cider sauce into a pitcher. Add lemon juice, then pour the sauce over the apples and serve warm or at room temperature.
