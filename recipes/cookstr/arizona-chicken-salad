In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat; brown chicken; add beans, onion, tomato, and chile powder; reduce heat; saute for 8 minutes; cool; set aside. Whisk Tabasco, sour cream, yogurt, vinegar, and mayonnaise together. Place chicken and beans into a large ensaladera-salad bowl; add lettuce; mix with dressing. Top with avocado slices and tortilla strips. Mexican Red Sauce, Green Sauce, or Pico De Gallo goes well with this salad.
