Heat the oil in a large frying pan set over medium-high heat. Add the onions, almonds, and currants and stir until the onions are wilted and the almonds browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the turkey, cumin, salt, and red wine. Cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. To assemble, spread about 1/3 cup of the turkey filling in the middle of a tortilla. Top with sliced jalapenos, shredded lettuce, sour cream, and mint. Fold and serve.
