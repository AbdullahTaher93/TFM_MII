In a medium saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the broth to the table in a fondue pot or chafing dish to keep it hot as the diners ladle as little or as much as they desire into their bowls. Present the remaining ingredients in bowls so diners can add as many as they like.
