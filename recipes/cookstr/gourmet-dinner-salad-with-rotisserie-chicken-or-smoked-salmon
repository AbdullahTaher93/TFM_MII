Wash and dry the salad greens. Put the greens in a large salad bowl. Add the chicken. In a food processor, thinly slice the pear, cucumber, fennel, and Belgian endives. Toss with the greens. Add the drained artichokes (leave a little oil on them to go into the salad) and tomato slices. Add the salt and toss. Add the olive oil and toss again. Add the red wine vinegar and toss again. Add the cherries and goat cheese. Toss and serve.
