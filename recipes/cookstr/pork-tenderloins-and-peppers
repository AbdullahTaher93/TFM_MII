Sprinkle pork with bay leaf pieces, chopped garlic, and thyme leaves. Cover with olive oil and let sit 2 hours. Cook the peppers on the plancha for about 10 minutes, turning frequently. Halfway through cooking, add the pork and cook 3 minutes on each side. At the same time as the pork is cooking, brown the sliced garlic. Season pork with salt and pepper and serve with garlic and peppers.
