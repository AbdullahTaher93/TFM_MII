In a medium saucepan, bring the ginger and canola oil to a boil over medium heat. Immediately remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer to a glass container, cover, and refrigerate. To use, strain the amount of oil you want through a fine strainer, leaving the remainder in the jar with the ginger. The oil will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
