Preheat the oven to 350°F. Trim any excess fat off the pork roast. Cut twelve ¼-inch-wide slits into the roast, and stuff each one with a garlic half and 2 or 3 lavender leaves. Generously sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper. Place the meat in a small roasting pan, slightly larger than the roast itself. Drizzle with the olive oil. Roast for about 1¼ to 1½ hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 150°F. Let the roast rest for 10 minutes before carving. Variations Rosemary, thyme, and sage work well.
