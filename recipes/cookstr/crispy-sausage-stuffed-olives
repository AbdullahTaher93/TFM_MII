In a bowl, combine the sausage meat, garlic, and red pepper flakes, if using, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly. Drain the olives and rinse them under running cold water. Stuff each of the olives with ¼ to ½ teaspoon of the sausage mixture. Spread the flour on a dinner plate. Break the egg into a shallow bowl and beat lightly. Spread the bread crumbs on another dinner plate. Moisten the bread crumbs with the olive oil, and stir to distribute the oil evenly. One at a time, roll the olives in the flour, coating them evenly and shaking off the excess. Then dip them in the egg, letting any excess drip back into the bowl. Finally, coat the olives evenly with the bread crumbs. As each olive is finished, place it on a tray. Cover and refrigerate the olives for at least 10 minutes or up to 2 hours before frying. Pour the peanut oil to a depth of at least 3 inches into a deep fryer or a heavy, 8-inch-deep stockpot and heat to 375°F. Working in batches, add the olives to the hot oil and fry until golden brown and the sausage stuffing is cooked through, about 3 minutes. The olives will bubble vigorously until they are nearly done, so be careful to avoid splatters. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Arrange the olives in a ceramic dish. Serve warm or at room temperature.
