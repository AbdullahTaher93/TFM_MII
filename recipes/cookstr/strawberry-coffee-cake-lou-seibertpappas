Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter and flour a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, butter, and granulated sugar, and beat with a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in the milk, eggs, and vanilla and beat thoroughly. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir to blend. Add to the cheese mixture and beat until smooth. Spread half of the batter in the prepared pan. Scatter the berries evenly over the batter. Dot the remaining batter over the berries. Mix the brown sugar and nuts together and sprinkle evenly over the batter. Bake for 40 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into squares.
