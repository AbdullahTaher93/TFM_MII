Place the rice, salt, and 2Â½ cups water in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer without stirring for 40 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in 3 tablespoons of the mirin and 4 tablespoons of the rice vinegar. Set aside to cool. In a large pot, bring 6 cups water, shiitake, tofu, and the remaining mirin and rice vinegar to boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Drain and discard the cooking water (or reserve as stock for later use). When the shiitake are cool enough to handle, remove and discard the stems. Cut the caps into thin strips and add to the rice. Cut the tofu into thin strips and add to the rice. Add all the remaining ingredients to the rice and toss. Serve at room temperature, or refrigerate and serve cold.
