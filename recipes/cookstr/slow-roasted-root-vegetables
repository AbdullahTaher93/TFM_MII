Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Put a heavy roasting pan over 2 burners on the stove. Heat the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, parsnips, turnip, and potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned in places, about 5 minutes. Generously season the vegetables with salt and pepper to taste. Add the rosemary and thyme and stir well to combine. Roast the vegetables in the oven until soft when pierced and golden brown, about 1 hour. Transfer to a large platter and serve.
