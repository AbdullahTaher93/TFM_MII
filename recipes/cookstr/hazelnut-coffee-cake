Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch (23-centimeter) springform pan. In a saucepan, melt the butter. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Toast the hazelnuts in a dry frying pan until they are slightly browned; then grind them in a food processor until almost finely ground. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and brown sugar until frothy. All the sugar should be dissolved and the batter should have a lighter color. Pour the slightly cooled butter into the egg yolk and sugar mixture and whisk together. Sift the flour and stir it carefully into the batter together with the hazelnuts, coffee, and salt. Stir as little as possible until you get a smooth, even batter. In a separate, grease-free bowl, whisk the egg whites, ideally with an electric mixer. When soft peaks form, add the cane sugar little by little. Mix until the batter forms stiff peaks. Carefully fold the sugar and egg white mixture into the batter and keep folding until the batter is evenly blended. Be careful not to overstir. Pour the batter directly into the pan. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes. The cake is done when a toothpick or knife inserted into the center comes out clean. If the cake starts to get a golden brown color earlier (which can happen after 20 minutes), remove it from the oven, cover it with aluminum foil, and put back in the oven. This will prevent the top of the cake from burning. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool slightly before serving.
