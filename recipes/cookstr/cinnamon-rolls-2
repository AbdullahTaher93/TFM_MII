Preheat the Oven to 350°F, Spray a 2-inch square cake pan with baking spray and set a side. Sift the whole-wheat pastry flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into a small bowl and set a side. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the ricotta, buttermilk, vanilla, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 4 or 5 times to form a smooth dough. If the dough is sticky, knead in a bit more flour. Roll the dough out to a 6-by-8-inch rectangle about ¼ inch thick and brush with 1½ tablespoons of the remaining butter. Mix the remaining 4 tablespoons of sugar with the cinnamon and pecans, if you are using them. Sprinkle evenly onto the dough, reserving about 1 tablespoon. Starting at a short end, roll the dough into a log and pinch the seam to seal. Trim the ends and slice into 6 even pieces. Place them, cut side up, into the prepared cake pan with their sides just touching. Brush the tops and sides of each roll with the remaining ½ tablespoon butter. Sprinkle the tops with the reserved sugar mixture. Bake until the edges are golden. 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, and drizzle with Glaze if desired.
