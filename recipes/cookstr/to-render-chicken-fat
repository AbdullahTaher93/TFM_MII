Chop the fat as finely as possible. Cover with the water and let it stand at room temperature for about 2 hours. In a small, heavy frying pan set over low heat, let it cook until all the fat has rendered out, the water has evaporated, and the bits of skin are a crisp golden brown. Strain and refrigerate, uncovered. It will keep for weeks, depending on the weather.
