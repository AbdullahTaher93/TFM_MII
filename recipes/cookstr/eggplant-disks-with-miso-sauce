In a saucepan, combine the miso, mirin, and sake, and mix with a spatula until smooth. Add the sugar, and place the pan over medium-low heat. Cook the mixture until it is no longer watery, about 5 minutes, stirring all the time. Add the scallion and sesame oil, and mix. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and set it aside. Cut each eggplant into four 2-inch thick disks. Make several shallow cuts in a checkerboard pattern on one cut surface of each disk. With a toothpick, prick the entire surface of the other cut surface. In a skillet, heat 2 inches of vegetable oil to 340 degrees F. Fry the eggplant over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cut surfaces are golden and the eggplant is cooked through. Drain the eggplant on a paper towel. (As an alternative to deep-frying the eggplant, you can rub it with 1/3 cup oil and bake it at 375 degrees F until it is soft and golden.) Serve the eggplant hot, topped with the miso sauce and garnished with the sesame seeds and shiso.
