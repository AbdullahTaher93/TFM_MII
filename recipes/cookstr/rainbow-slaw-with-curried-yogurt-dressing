FIRST Remove the tough outer leaves from the cabbage and cut each in half. Cut out the core. Separate and stack the leaves together and cut into fine julienne strips. (You should have about 12 cups.) Put in a bowl, sprinkle in the salt, toss lightly, and cover with a plate with a heavy pot on top. Let sit for about 1 hour and drain in a colander. Grate the carrots. SECOND Heat a small, heavy skillet until hot. Put the curry powder in the pan and stir with a wooden spoon over medium-low heat until the curry powder is very fragrant. Scrape out onto a plate to cool. THIRD To make the Curried Yogurt Dressing, put the yogurt in a mixing bowl and add the curry powder and the remaining ingredients of the dressing, whisking lightly after each addition. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. FOURTH Put the drained cabbage, carrots, and raisins in a bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss lightly to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, tossing occasionally. Serve.
