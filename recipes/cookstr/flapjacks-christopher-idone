In large mixing bowl, combine all of the dry ingredients. Add the milk, eggs, and melted butter, and mix together. Set aside. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet, tilting to coat the entire bottom of the pan. Using a two-ounce ladle, pour circles of pancake batter into the pan. When the pancakes bubble, flip them over with a spatula and brown the other side. Serve with additional butter, warmed maple syrup, and Cranberry Kumquat Conserve.
