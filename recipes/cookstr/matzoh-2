Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly sprinkle a large baking sheet with flour and set aside. Place the water in a large mixing bowl, then add 2 cups of the flour, the oil, and salt. Mix the ingredients first with a wooden spoon, then with your hand. Knead the dough for a minute just to see if it is firm enough to handle. If it isn’t, add a little more flour. Shape the dough into a ball. Cut the dough in half. On a floured board, roll out each half into a large thin circle. Place the circles on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the matzoh is very dry and crisp, and just beginning to brown. Remove the pan from the oven and set on a wire rack. When the matzoh is thoroughly cool, break into pieces and store in an airtight container.
