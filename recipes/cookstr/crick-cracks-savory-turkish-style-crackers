In the mixing bowl fitted for a standing mixer (such as a Kitchen Aid), combine the 1½ cups of the flour, the cornmeal, sugar, ½ teaspoon of the salt, and the butter. Using the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, mix the ingredients on low speed until the butter breaks down into pea-sized pieces. Pour in the buttermilk and mix again until it is just combined. The dough will come together quickly and will be a little wet. Wrap the dough in plastic, pressing it into a flat rectangle about an inch thick. Chill the dough for 3 hours or overnight. Divide the dough into quarters. Lightly flour your rolling-out surface with about ¼ cup of flour. Roll out the first quarter into a rectangle, approximately 12 × 15 inches. Don’t worry about making the dough into the perfect size or shape; it’s most important that it rolls out to be 1/16 inch thick or as thin as you can make it. Line a heavy baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the dough over the rolling pin or fold it in half to pick it up and place it on the lined baking sheet. Place another sheet of paper on top of the rolled dough and roll out the remaining quarters of dough, layering them on the baking sheet, separated by parchment paper. This is an easy way to store the dough as it chills. Chill the rolled-out dough for at least an hour or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place 1 sheet of dough onto each of 4 heavy baking sheets, leaving them on the parchment paper. Dock the dough by pricking little holes into it with a fork; this keeps the dough from bubbling too much when it bakes and creates a cracker pattern. Using a ruler and a pizza cutter or knife, cut the dough into 3-inch squares, leaving odd pieces on the ends. It’s easier to leave those pieces to snack on after they’re baked rather than reroll the scraps and repeat the process. The dough will get tough if rerolled. . In a small mixing bowl, combine the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, nigella seeds, and the remaining teaspoon of salt. . Using a pastry brush, moisten each sheet of cut crackers lightly with water and then sprinkle each evenly with the salted seed mixture. . Place the crackers in the oven and reduce the temperature to 325°F. Bake them for 8 minutes and rotate the pan. Continue baking the crackers for another 10 to 11 minutes or until lightly browned. If your oven can only hold two pans at a time, keep the other two chilled while you are baking the first two. . Cool the crick-cracks completely before serving. Store them in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
