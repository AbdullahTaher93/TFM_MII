Preparing the cream: Pour the cream into a small saucepan, set over low heat and stir just until the chill is off; do not heat above 100° (lukewarm). Stir in the buttermilk and pour into a glass jar. Ripening the cream. Set the lid on the jar (but don’t tighten it) and place in a warm (80–90°) spot. Let the cream culture and set for 12 to 24 hours, until noticeably thicker (perhaps almost set like yogurt or sour cream). Stir gently, screw on the lid and refrigerate at least 4 hours to chill and complete the thickening.
