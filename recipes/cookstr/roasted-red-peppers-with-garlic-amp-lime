1). Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with foil and coat with about 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. 2). Place the peppers on the tray, laying them on their sides. Roast in the center of the oven for about 30 to 35 minutes, turning the peppers with tongs every 5 to 8 minutes, so they will roast – and blister – fairly evenly. 3). When the peppers are quite soft and the skins have darkened and pulled away from the flesh, remove the tray from the oven. Use tongs to transfer the peppers to a bowl, then cover the bowl with a plate. Let the peppers cools until comfortable to handle. (The roasted peppers will express flavorful juices while cooling. Save this liquid and use it for soup stock or a sauce.) 4). Peel each pepper, using your hands and/or a paring knife. Also remove and discard the stems and seeds. Cut the peppers into small cubes or strips and transfer them to a second medium-sized bowl. 5). Add the remaining ingredients and mix gently. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. (Longer is fine.) Serve cold or at room temperature.
