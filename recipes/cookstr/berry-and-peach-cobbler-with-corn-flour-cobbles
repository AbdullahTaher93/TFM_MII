Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly butter a 2½-quart baking dish. If using peaches, dip them into boiling water for 5 to 10 seconds, then pull off the skins. Pit and slice the fruit, put it in a bowl with the berries, and toss with the sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon. Let stand while the oven heats and you make the biscuit topping. Mix the flour, corn flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl, then cut in the butter using 2 knives or your fingers. Beat the eggs with the vanilla and buttermilk. Using a fork or your fingertips, lightly stir these wet ingredients into the flour mixture until it is mixed evenly. It will be rather wet. Transfer the fruit to the baking dish. Then drop the cobbler batter by small spoonfuls over the top, covering the entire surface. Bake in the center of the oven until the topping is golden brown and the juices are bubbling around the edge, about 25 minutes. Let cool and settle for at least 20 minutes before serving.
