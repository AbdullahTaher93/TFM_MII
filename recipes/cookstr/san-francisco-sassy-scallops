Place scallops in a glass or porcelain bowl and cover with lemon juice. Stir to coat well. Cover and refrigerate, stirring frequently, about 2 hours, or until scallops “cook” in lemon juice an turn opaque. Meanwhile, prepare sauce. In a blender or food processor, process bell peppers, vinegar, oil, pequín, and salt, if desired, until puréed. Taste and adjust seasonings. To serve, pit and peel avocado, and then cut lengthwise in slivers. Divide bell-pepper sauce equally among 4 to 6 clear glass plates. Drain scallops, center on sauce, and garnish edge of each plate with avocado slivers.
