Pour the lemon juice and water into the pressure cooker. Set a trivet or steamer basket on the bottom and place the artichokes on top (they donâ€™t need to be in a single layer). Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes for soft artichokes or 6 minutes if you prefer them firmer. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure. When the steam subsides, pour off the liquid, taking care not to break the artichokes apart. Set aside without disturbing until cool enough to handle. When ready to serve, arrange the artichokes in a serving dish and pour the sauce over them. If using the butter sauce, serve right away while still warm. If using the flavored oil sauce, the dish may sit and marinate for up to several hours. For the Butter: Heat the lemon juice and garlic together in a small saucepan over medium heat until beginning to steam. Whisk in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, making sure each addition is incorporated before continuing, until you have a smooth sauce. Serve right away, or set aside in a warm spot for up to 30 minutes and whisk to smooth before serving.
