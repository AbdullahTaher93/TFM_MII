Liberally season the shanks with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. In uncrowded batches, brown the shanks on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer the shanks to a large ovenproof casserole. Add the onions to the skillet and sauté for 10 minutes until lightly browned and limp. Scrape into the casserole. Deglaze the pan with the wine, scraping up the browned bits that have adhered to the skillet. Pour into the casserole. Add the tomatoes, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and orange zest, with enough stock to barely cover the shanks. Cover and bake at 350° for 1½ hours or until the meat is fork-tender but still clings to the bone. Remove the casserole from the oven. Transfer the shanks to a platter and cover to keep warm. Degrease the cooking liquid and season with salt and pepper. Add the beans and parsley and bury the shanks in the beans and sauce. Cover and return to the oven to bake until the beans absorb some of the sauce, about 15 minutes.
