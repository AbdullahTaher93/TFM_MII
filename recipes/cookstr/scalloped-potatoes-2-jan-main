Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes, until barely tender. Drain well and let cool; slice thickly. In the same saucepan, stir together flour and oil until smooth; cook over medium heat until starting to pull away from bottom of pan. Remove from heat. Gradually whisk in milk until smooth. Return to medium heat and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened. Whisk in salt, pepper and nutmeg. Spoon potatoes into prepared baking dish and pour sauce over top. In a small bowl, stir together bread crumbs, oil and cheese (if using) until well mixed. Sprinkle evenly over potatoes. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until heated through.
