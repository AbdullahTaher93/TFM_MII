Put the chicken and 7 quarts cold water in a tall stockpot and bring to a boil. Add 3 quarts more cold water (it should be very cold) and bring to a boil; skim off any fat that rises to the top. Lower the heat so that the water simmers, and simmer—skimming regularly—for 10 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and simmer for 3 hours, continuing to skim so that the stock will be clear. Strain the stock through a colander. Allow the solids to drain for a few minutes before discarding them, then strain the stock through a chinois or fine-mesh sieve. Let cool to room temperature, then cover tightly and refrigerate. (The stock can be kept tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 1 month.)
