Position the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F. Cut out four 15 × 12-inch pieces of parchment paper. Fold one piece of parchment paper in half to make a 12 x 7½-inch rectangle, then unfold the paper on a work surface. Spread 1 teaspoon of the butter in the center of half the paper, covering an area the size of 2 fillets. Place 2 fillets, side by side and skin side up, atop the buttered area. Dot the fillets with 1 teaspoon butter. Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon of the orange peel and ¼ teaspoon of the lemon peel over the fillets. Sprinkle with freshly ground white pepper. Fold the second half of the paper over the fish. Beginning at one end of the folded corners, seal the package by folding the edges of the paper at 1-inch increments, overlapping the folds along the edges and tapering the paper inward at the corner to form a crescent-shaped package. Repeat to form 4 packages total. To Finish And Serve: Drizzle the olive oil over a heavy large rimmed baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven just until the oil begins to smoke, about 5 minutes. Arrange the packages on the hot baking sheet. Bake until the packages puff and the fish is just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer 1 package to each of 4 plates. Serve immediately, then cut the top of the packages open.
