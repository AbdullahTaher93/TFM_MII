Drain the tomatoes, reserving their juice. Strain the captured juice to hold back the seeds. Using your fingers, push out the excess seeds from each tomato. Using your hands, a fork, or a potato masher, crush or mash the tomatoes well. Set the tomatoes and juice aside. In a cold saucepan over medium-low heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the garlic together, and saut√© until the garlic is soft but not colored, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir; then add the tomatoes and their juice. Simmer over low heat, uncovered, until enough of the liquid evaporates to form a sauce that will coat a spoon, about 25 minutes. Tear the basil into small pieces and stir them into the sauce along with the salt. Simmer for another minute or two. Remove from the heat and stir in the pepper and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. VARIATION: Northerners tend to use onion rather than garlic in this sauce. Substitute 1 small red, white, or yellow onion, chopped, for the garlic.
