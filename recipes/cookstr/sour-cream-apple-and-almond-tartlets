Pulse the flour, butter, and sugar, until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Add the yolk and pulse until the dough begins to clump together. Chill for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 6 portions, and roll each on a floured work surface into an 1/8 in (3mm) thick round to fit a 4in (10cm) tartlet pan. Prick the dough. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C). Line each tart pan with wax paper and fill with baking beans. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and bake for another 10 minutes, until golden. Remove the pans and reduce the temperature to 375째F (190째C). To make the filling, whisk the sour cream, almond flour, eggs, brown sugar, maple syrup, liqueur, and vanilla extract. Divide among the pans. Top with the apples and sprinkle with sugar. Bake 20 minutes, until set. Cool for 10 minutes. Remove the sides of the pans and cool completely. Serve at room temperature.
