Preheat oven to 350°F. Thaw the spinach and squeeze out any moisture. Remove the casing from the sausage and crumble. Fry the chorizo in a skillet and drain. Lightly brush the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with oil. Place the tortilla strips in the bottom of the dish, slightly overlapping. Combine the flour, chili powder and salt in a bowl. Sprinkle ½ of flour mixture over the tortillas. Combine the tomatoes, salsa, green onions and jalapeno. Layer the tomato mixture over the flour mixture. Sprinkle the tomato layer with the remaining flour mixture. Sprinkle the cooked chorizo sausage on top of the flour mixture. In a medium bowl combine the eggs, milk, spinach and a ½ cup of the grated cheese. Pour the egg mixture evenly over the chorizo. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake 5 minutes longer. Slice and serve warm. This quiche freezes and reheats easily.
