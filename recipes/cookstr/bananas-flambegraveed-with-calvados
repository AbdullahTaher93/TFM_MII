Remove the zest from half an orange with a potato peeler and mince the zest. Squeeze the juice from both oranges' you should have about ½ cup. Peel the bananas and halve lengthwise. Melt 3 tbsp of the butter in a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the banana and cook until lightly browned on both sides. Transfer to a plate, cover, and keep warm. Add the remaining 1 tbsp butter to the pan and melt. Sprinkle in the sugar and cook, stirring occasionally. Add the orange juice and zest and lime juice, bring to a boil, and cook until thickened, about 2–3 minutes. Add the Calvados. Light with a long-handled match and cook until the flames burn out. Return the bananas to the pan and turn gently in the sauce to reheat.
