Preheat the oven to 300Â°F. Break the stems off the chile pods, and discard most of the seeds. Place the pods in a single layer on a cookie sheet and roast them in the oven for about 5 minutes. Watch the pods closely because they can scorch easily. Break each chile into several pieces. Transfer the chiles to a blender and blend until they are evenly ground. In a medium bowl, mix together the ground chile and all the other ingredients. Cover the bowl; and refrigerate it at least 8 hours and preferably 24. Use the chorizo as needed. Form it into patties, or fry it as is over medium heat until it is richly browned. It keeps, uncooked and refrigerated, at least a week.
