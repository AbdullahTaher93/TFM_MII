Place a bowl of iced water near the stove. Bring a small pan of water to a boil over high heat and add the eggs. Cook for 2Â½ minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to the iced water. Let cool, then peel the eggs. Lightly toast the bread and, using a 2in (5cm) cookie cutter, cut 2 circles or ovals from each slice. Divide the toasts among 4 plates. Combine the yogurt, mayonnaise, cilantro, and curry powder in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk the lemon juice and oil together in a medium bowl, then add the cilantro and parsley leaves, and toss. Cut each egg in half and arrange 1 egg on each toast. Spoon the curry sauce over the top. Serve immediately, garnished with the dressed herbs. Variation: This recipe works equally well with 4 hard-boiled hen's eggs. Boil for 6 minutes, peel, then cut into quarters.
