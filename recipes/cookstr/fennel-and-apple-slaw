To make the slaw: Cut the apples into matchstick pieces. Place them in a large decorative bowl and toss with the lemon juice to prevent discoloration. Cut the fennel into matchstick pieces and combine with the apple. Chop the fennel fronds and set them aside. Toss the mint with the apples and fennel. Add the Honey-Mustard Vinaigrette, coating the apples and fennel thoroughly. Garnish with the fennel fronds and serve. To make the vinaigrette: Whisk the mustard, honey, vinegar, and salt and pepper together in a small bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Continue whisking until the vinaigrette thickens. Refrigerate, covered, until 30 minutes before youâ€™re ready to use it. Let the vinaigrette come to room temperature before dressing the slaw.
