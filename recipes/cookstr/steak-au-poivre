Trim any excess fat from the steaks. If using filet mignons, flatten slightly with a meat mallet. Sprinkle with the mustard. Crush the peppercorns in a mortar or under a saucepan and press on both sides of the steaks. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over high heat. Add the steaks and cook, 2–3 minutes each side for a rare steak, 4 minutes each side for medium, and 5–6 minutes each side for well done. Transfer to a platter and tent with aluminum foil. Add the sherry to the pan and stir up the browned bits. Add the créme fraîche and cook for 3 minutes, until slightly thickened. Place the steaks on individual plates and top with the sauce. Serve hot.
