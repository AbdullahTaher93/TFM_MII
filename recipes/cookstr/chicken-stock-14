In a stockpot, Dutch oven, or another large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Cook the chicken, onion, and carrot until they begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes, until the carrot and onion release their juices. Add the turnip, celery, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns, salt, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes. Strain and reserve the stock, discarding the solids.
