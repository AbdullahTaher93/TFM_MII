In a large bowl using an electric mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, bear the oil, honey, and sweet potato. Bear in the eggs. Add the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk in 2 additions, mixing until just combined. Scrape the barter into the prepared skillet and sprinkle with the pumpkin seeds and some salt.
