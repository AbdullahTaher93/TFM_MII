Preheat the oven to 375Â° F. Wrap a half slice of bacon around the circumference of each scallop, like a belt. Pierce the scallop through the side with a skewer to keep the bacon in place. Dust each bacon-wrapped scallop with flour and season with salt and pepper. Melt the butter in a 10- or 12-inch ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat. When the butter begins to foam, add the scallops to the pan and brown them, about 2 minutes. Turn the scallops over and add the shallots and capers to the pan. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the spinach and lemon juice and saute until the spinach is just wilted, about 2 minutes. Season the spinach with salt and pepper. Transfer the spinach to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep it warm. Remove the pan from the oven and arrange the scallops over the spinach. Spoon the shallots and capers over the scallops and serve.
