EQUIPMENT: 2 rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment paper In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and beat until combined. Turn the mixer to low speed and add the lemon zest and poppy seeds. Carefully add the flour, mixing just until incorporated. Divide the dough in half and roll each half into a 12-inch cylinder. Place half the sliced almonds on a piece of parchment paper or wax paper and roll 1 log in the almonds, pressing lightly so they adhere to the log. Repeat with the second log of dough and the remaining almonds. Wrap each log in parchment paper or wax paper and twist the ends. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight, until firm. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Remove the logs from the refrigerator and rest for 10 minutes. Cut the logs into &frac38;-inch slices and place them on the prepared pans 1 inch apart. Bake until the bottoms and edges of the cookies are just beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the cookies on the pans on a rack. Repeat as needed with the remaining dough and cooled pans until all the cookies are baked, or freeze the dough for future use. Store the cooled cookies between layers of parchment paper or wax paper in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
