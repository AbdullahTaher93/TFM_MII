Place the clams and mussels in a large bowl of water. Stir in the cornmeal and soak for 1 hour to remove any sand. Drain the shellfish, rinse well, and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions, fennel, garlic, and red pepper flakes, cover the pot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 15 minutes. Pour the tomatoes and their juices into a food processor or blender, and process until pureed. Add the pureed tomatoes, tomato sauce, wine, clam juice, and Pernod to the pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, season with salt and pepper, and simmer, uncovered, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Add the reserved clams and mussels, cover the pot, and cook until they begin to open, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the shrimp and scallops, and cook, uncovered, until they are cooked through, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tarragon and, ¼ cup of the parsley. Adjust the seasonings, adding salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the stew to a serving bowl, discarding any clams or mussels that have not opened, and sprinkle with the remaining ¼ cup of the parsley. Serve with the toasted peasant bread.
