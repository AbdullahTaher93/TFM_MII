Pour 2 tablespoons hot water over the tamarind and sugar in a small bowl. Stir until the mixture comes together in a paste. Add the rice wine, honey, and fish sauce and stir well to combine. Set aside. Arrange the cucumber slices in an overlapping pattern around the edge of a serving platter. Arrange the tomatoes decoratively around the platter; overlapping the cucumbers where necessary. Arrange the pea shoots in a heap in the center of the platter. Set the platter aside. Heat the peanut oil in a large wok or saute pan over high heat. Add the chiles and heat through for 30 seconds. Add the ginger, cook for 30 seconds, then add the shrimp and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tamarind glaze and bring to a boil. Toss or stir the shrimp well to coat in the glaze. Cook just until the shrimp turn firm and pink, 1 to 2 minutes more. If using whole Thai chiles, remove them with tongs and discard. Spoon the shrimp over the pea shoots, scatter the peanuts over the top, and serve the salad family style from the center of the table.
