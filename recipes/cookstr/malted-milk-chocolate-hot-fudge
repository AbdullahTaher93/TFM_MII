In a 6-quart or larger heavy pot over medium-high heat, warm the cream. Whisk in the malted milk powder and stir until dissolved. Add the sugar and syrup and stir until dissolved, approximately 3 minutes. Add the chocolate and salt and bring to a boil. Lower to a gentle simmer so that the bubbles percolate?in the center of the pot. Cook, stirring periodically to avoid scorching the bottom, until the mixture thickens but before the oils separate from the solids, 26 to 32 minutes. Whisk in the butter, vanilla, and coffee thoroughly (you can also use an immersion blender to do this if you want it extra smooth) and let cool. This hot fudge keeps in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.
