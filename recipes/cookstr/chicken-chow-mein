Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Drain and toss with 1 tsp of the oil. Mix the stock, soy sauce, and rice wine in a bowl, sprinkle in the cornstarch and stir to dissolve. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Add the scallions, mushrooms, red pepper, and ginger. Stir-fry until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil and heat. In two batches, add the chicken and stir-fry until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the vegetables. Add the remaining 1 tbsp oil to the wok and heat. Add the green beans and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until crisp-tender. Add the noodles and return the chicken and vegetables to the wok. Add the stock mixture and stir-fry about 2 minutes, or until the noodles are piping hot. Serve at once, with soy sauce for seasoning. Variations: Seafood Chow Mein: Instead of chicken, use the same weight of raw shrimp, shelled and deveined, or a mixture of shrimp and other seafood such as scallops. Reduce the cooking time to 1â€“2 minutes. In step 3, add 4oz (115g) of bean sprouts along with the green beans. Stir-fry noodles: Always add fresh noodles towards the end of a stir-fry recipe. They will go soggy if overcooked. If using dried noodles, boil them first, then rinse and drain until ready to use.
