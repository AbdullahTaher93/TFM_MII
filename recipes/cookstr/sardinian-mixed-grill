Place the sweet and hot Italian sausages together in a large skillet and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat until the sausages are no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the sausages and cut into Â¾-inch slices. Thread 2 each chicken chunks, sausage, and shrimp alternately on each of 16 to 18 bamboo skewers. Arrange in a single layer in a large shallow glass dish. In a small bowl whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the marinade over the skewers and let marinate at room temperature, turning occasionally, 45 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the fireplace or grill for cooking. Grill the skewers 4 inches above the hot coals, basting occasionally and turning once, until the meat and shrimp are browned on the outside and just cooked through inside, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve hot as an appetizer or light dinner.
