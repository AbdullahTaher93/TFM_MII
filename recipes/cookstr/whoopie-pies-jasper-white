Adjust the racks to the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. To make the cakes: Combine the cocoa and milk in a medium saucepan, set over low heat, and whisk to create a smooth paste. Add the butter, sugar, and corn syrup and continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth and glossy and the sugar has dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let cool. Whisk the eggs into the cooled cocoa syrup. Place the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or another large bowl. With the mixer on medium speed, or beating with a hand mixer, slowly pour the cocoa syrup into the flour mixture, mixing until combined. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip and pipe out 2-inch rounds spaced 3 inches apart onto the baking sheets, 12 per pan. Place both pans in the oven and bake until the cakes puff and are set, about 10 minutes, rotating the pans top to bottom and back to front after 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and slide the parchment sheets with the cookies onto a counter. Cool for 2 minutes, then transfer the cakes to a cooling rack with a metal spatula and cool completely. To make the filling: Beat the butter in the bowl of the standing mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with the handheld mixer, until fluffy about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes more. Add the Marshmallow Fluff, vanilla, and salt and beat to combine, about 30 seconds. To assemble the whoopie pies, turn half the cakes onto their backs and spread each with a generous portion of the filling. Place a second cake on the top of each to make a sandwich.
