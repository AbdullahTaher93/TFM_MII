To make the chocolate pudding: Put the cream, cardamom, star anise, vanilla seeds and pod, if using, and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat and let the mixture sit, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Set the pan over medium-low heat, add the gelatin, and stir until dissolved. Add the chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract, if using, then remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Divide among eight serving cups or bowls and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours. To make the caramel crisped rice cereal: Line a baking sheet with a nonstick baking mat or foil. Put the sugar, corn syrup, and butter in a medium saucepan and set over medium-high heat. Cook, swirling the pan occasionally to evenly dissolve the sugar, until the mixture becomes a medium-dark amber that registers 320Â°F on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir the mixture well with a heatproof spatula, then add the cereal and salt and stir until all the cereal is well coated. Spread the caramelized cereal on the lined baking sheet, trying to separate the cereal into small clumps. Cool completely, until crisp. You can store the crisped cereal in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. To serve, un mold the puddings, if desired, and top with the caramel crisped cereal. If desired, garnish each with a spoonful of drunken cherries and a dollop of chantilly.
