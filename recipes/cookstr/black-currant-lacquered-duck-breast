Preheat the oven to 375Â° F. With the point of a knife, score the skin side of the duck breasts in a crosshatch pattern, being careful not to pierce the flesh. This helps release and render the layer of fat under the skin and makes the finished duck look stunning. Heat a saute pan over medium heat for 2 minutes. Season the duck breasts with salt and pepper. Put the breasts in the pan, skin side down, and cook over medium to low heat to render the fat and brown the skin, 6 to 8 minutes. Carefully drain off and discard any accumulated fat from the pan and return the pan to the stove. Carefully turn the breasts over and brown the flesh side for 3 to 4 minutes, or several more minutes for magret breasts. Remove the breasts to a plate and cover to keep warm. Add the shallots to the pan and return the pan to the heat. Saute the shallots until softened but not browned, 2 minutes, then add the ginger, honey, jam, and vinegar and stir. Bring to a simmer and let simmer for 2 or 3 minutes to reduce and thicken to a lacquer-like glaze. Put the breasts, skin side up, on a nonstick cookie sheet, brush some lacquer on the upward-facing side of each breast, and reheat in the oven for 3 minutes. To serve, slice the breasts lengthwise or crosswise and arrange the slices of 1 breast on each of 4 plates. Quickly reheat the sauce, if necessary, and drizzle some around the duck breasts.
