With a sharp knife, make incisions in the chicken breasts and set aside. Put the chile powder, ginger paste, garlic paste, yogurt, salt, lemon juice, garam masala, and 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large bowl, and stir well. Add the chicken and stir well so that all the pieces are well covered with the mixture. Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator to marinate for 3 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C. Thread the chicken pieces onto metal skewers, arrange on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until almost done. Baste with the remaining oil and cook for 4 minutes more. When cooled, remove the chicken from the skewers and shred it. In a large bowl, combine the shredded chicken, bell peppers, onion, chiles, half of the cilantro, the lemon juice, chaat masala, mango (if using), and salt and toss to mix well. Transfer to a serving plate, garnish with the remaining cilantro, and serve.
