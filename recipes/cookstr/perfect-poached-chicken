Place the chicken breasts in a 4Â½-quart Dutch oven or soup pot. Peel the onion, cut it into 4 pieces, and add them to the pot. Cut the celery into 4 pieces and add them to the pot. Peel the carrot, cut it into roughly 1-inch pieces, and add them to the pot. Sprinkle the black pepper over the chicken and vegetables. Add just enough cold water to completely cover the chicken and vegetables, then sprinkle in the salt, if using. Cover the pot and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. As soon as the water reaches a vigorous boil, remove the pot from the heat and let it stand, covered, until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes for average-size pieces. (Test for doneness by cutting into a breast half.) Do not overcook. When the chicken is done, remove it from the pot, using tongs or a slotted spoon. Allow the chicken to cool enough to cut into bite-size chunks for future use. Allow the poaching liquid to cool, transfer to a storage container, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months (see Notes).
