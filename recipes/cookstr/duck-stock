In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until smoking and sear the duck bones until golden brown. Add the onion, celery, and carrots and saut√© 2 to 3 minutes. Add the bay leaf, peppercorns, wine, stock, and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and skimming. Strain, cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until the fat solidifies and lift it off the soup. Refrigerate up to 1 week. After 3 days, bring to a boil. Then boil, skim, and cool every 2 days; or freeze.
