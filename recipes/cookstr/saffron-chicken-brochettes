Pour over the chicken and onions, mix gently, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Mix the butter and the remaining lemon juice together. Place an oiled rack 6 in (15cm) from the heat. Preheat the broiler, and thread the chicken onto the skewers. Broil, turning occasionally, brushing with the butter mixture, about 10 minutes. Garnish with the basil and serve hot. 3. Place an oiled rack 6 in (15cm) from the heat. Preheat the broiler, and thread the chicken onto the skewers.
