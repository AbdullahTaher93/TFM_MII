Preheat the oven to 400°F. Put the tomatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle them generously with olive oil. Toss to coat evenly, then place them cut-side up. Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle the chopped garlic evenly over each tomato. Lay about 12 to 15 thyme sprigs over the tomatoes. Roast the tomatoes in the oven until soft but still holding their shape, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Then pinch off the skins, being careful not to damage the shape of the tomatoes. Unfold the puff pastry onto another baking sheet. Brush the surface of the pastry well with olive oil. Lay the tomatoes, cut-side up, evenly over the pastry, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Fold the pastry edges up, creating a ½-inch border. Press the edges to seal and brush with olive oil. Season the tomatoes with a little more salt and pepper and bake until the crust begins to puff and brown, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove the tart from the oven and crumble the goat cheese evenly over it. Return the tart to the oven and bake until the cheese begins to brown and the crust is golden, about 10 minutes longer. Allow the tart to cool slightly before cutting and serving.
