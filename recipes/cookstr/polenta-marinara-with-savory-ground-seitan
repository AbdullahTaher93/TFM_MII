To prepare the polenta, combine the cornmeal, salt, and 4 cups of the water in a heavy saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir constantly as the cornmeal begins to thicken. When the cornmeal starts to boil, add the remaining 2 cups of water while stirring briskly. Reduce the heat to low and place a flame diffuser under the pot. Cover and simmer the mixture for about 40 minutes, stirring and checking the consistency every 10 minutes. It should be smooth and thick but not stiff. Evenly spread the cooked polenta in a lightly oiled 10-inch square baking dish. Allow the polenta to cool at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. When the polenta is firm, preheat the oven to 375Â°F. In a medium bowl, combine the seitan, black pepper, sage, garlic granules, paprika, nutmeg, mustard and onion. Mix together well. Spread the marinara sauce evenly over the polenta. Top with the seasoned seitan-onion mixture. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake for 15 minutes. Longer baking time may be needed if the polenta has been refrigerated prior to baking. Serve hot.
