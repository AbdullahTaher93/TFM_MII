Peel away any skin from the kidneys and cut out the core and membranes. Soak in water to cover for 5–10 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Heat the butter and oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook the onion, stirring often, for 2–3 minutes. Increase the heat, add the kidneys and garlic, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring. Add the mushrooms, and cook for 2–3 minutes more. Add the vermouth and stock and boil about 1 minute, until slightly reduced. Reduce the heat and cover. Cook for 4 minutes, or until the kidneys are tender and cooked through. Stir in the mustard and season with salt and pepper.
