Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Spread the tomatoes out on the sheet, cut side up, and sprinkle with the salt. Roast until the tomatoes are browned and slightly shriveled, about 25 minutes. Arrange the lettuce on a serving platter and top with the roasted tomatoes and blue cheese. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, and mustard. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and serve.
