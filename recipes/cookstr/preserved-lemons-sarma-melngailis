Cut the stems off the lemons and then cut the lemons crosswise into very thin slices. Remove the seeds, and place the lemon slices in the salad press or other container. In a blender, combine the lemon juice, water, and salt and blend well. Pour this liquid over the lemons and apply pressure with the salad press top, or using another method, so that the ingredients are completely submerged in liquid. Set this aside to sit at room temperature for a minimum of 5 days. Store the lemons immersed in the preserving liquid in a jar in the refrigerator If the lemons are too salty for your taste, you can rinse them well before using, or drain some or all of the brine and store the lemons in fresh water.
