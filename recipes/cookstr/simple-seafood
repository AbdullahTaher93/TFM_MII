Sprinkle the flour onto a large plate. Season the fish with salt and pepper and then dip it in the flour to coat on all sides. Transfer to a clean plate. In a large saut√© pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the coated fish to the pan and cook for several minutes (depending on the thickness of the fish), until the fish is golden brown on the underside. Flip and cook until it is golden brown on the other side and the center is white, flaky, and cooked all the way through. Transfer the fish to a clean plate and cover it with foil to keep warm. To make the sauce, add the wine to the pan and turn the heat to high. Cook the wine for several minutes, until reduced by half, while scraping the brown bits off the bottom of the pan and incorporating them into the sauce. Pour in the lemon juice and stir to combine. The sauce will remain somewhat thin. Drizzle the sauce over the fish and garnish with fresh parsley or capers, if desired. Serve warm.
