To make the vinaigrette: Combine 2 roasted tomato halves, the tomato juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor and pur√©e. With the machine running, slowly add the olive oil and process until emulsified, then set aside. To make the salad: Combine the fennel and herbs in a small bowl. Dress with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper and mix well. To cook the tuna and assemble the dish: Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil. Season the tuna on both sides with salt and pepper and sear (about 2 minutes per side for rare). Transfer the tuna to a cutting board and slice thin across the grain. To serve, arrange the remaining roasted tomato halves on plates, place the tuna slices over the tomatoes, top with fennel salad, and drizzle with tomato vinaigrette.
