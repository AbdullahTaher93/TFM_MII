Drain the tomatoes, reserving their juice or puree. Strain the captured juice or puree to hold back the seeds. Using your fingers, push out the excess seeds from each tomato. Chop the tomatoes and set aside with their juice or purée. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion and sauté until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the sausage meat and sauté gently until the meat has browned but not hardened, 5 to 7 minutes. If using tomato puree, simply stir in the chopped tomatoes and puree. If using tomato paste, first add the paste and stir, then add the chopped tomatoes and their juice. If using saffron threads, heat them gently in a small pan on the stove top for 1 minute. Then crush them between your fingers and stir them into the sauce. If using saffron powder, simply stir it into the sauce. Add the salt and simmer gently, uncovered, over medium-low heat, until a thick consistency forms, about 25 minutes. Stir the sauce occasionally as it cooks. Taste and adjust for salt just before serving.
