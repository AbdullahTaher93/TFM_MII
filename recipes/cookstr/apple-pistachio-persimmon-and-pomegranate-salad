For the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, honey, salt, and pepper until the salt dissolves. Slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking as you go, until the mixture is emulsified. Set aside. In a skillet over medium-low heat, toast the pistachios, stirring often, until browned and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Set aside. Set out six serving plates, preferably chilled. Divide the arugula among the plates, then top each plate with equal portions of apples and persimmons. Sprinkle each plate with pistachios and pomegranate seeds. Just before serving, drizzle with dressing. 3. Set out six serving plates, preferably chilled. Divide the arugula among the plates, then top each plate with equal portions of apples and persimmons.
