Prepare the vegetables of your choice and cut them into small bite-sized pieces. Toss with the salt in a large glass bowl. Cover and let stand overnight in a cool place. The following day, drain the vegetables well. Bring the vinegar and chiles to a boil in a nonreactive saucepan and cook for 2 minutes. Let stand for 30 minutes. Strain the vinegar, discarding the chiles. Mix together the sugar, cornstarch, mustard, and turmeric in a bowl. Stir in enough of the vinegar to make a smooth paste. Return the remaining vinegar to its saucepan, and return to a boil. Whisk the hot vinegar into the paste, then return to the saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the vegetables. Pack into five sterilized, hot 8 oz (225g) glass jars and seal immediately while still hot. Let stand until cool. Wipe clean and label. Store the jars in a cool dark place for at least 4 weeks before serving. Once opened, store in the refrigerator and eat within 1 week.
