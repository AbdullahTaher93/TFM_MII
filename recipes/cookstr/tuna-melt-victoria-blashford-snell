Position a broiler rack 6in (15cm) from the heat and preheat. Split the muffins and toast. Heat the oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the red pepper, scallions, and shallots. Cook, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Add the tuna, breaking up the chunks with a fork. Cook for about 1 minute, until the tuna is heated through. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the ketchup, 2 tbsp of the mayonnaise, and the lemon zest. Spread the remaining mayonnaise over the cut sides of the muffins. Spread 4 muffin halves with the tuna mixture and arrange the cheese triangles on top. Grill until the cheese melts. Top with the remaining 4 muffin halves. Serve at once.
