Put the potatoes and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a covered soup pot with enough water to generously cover and bring to a boil on high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another pot, blanch the cabbage and broccoli in boiling water until just tender, 6 or 7 minutes. Drain, and set aside. In a covered saucepan or skillet on medium-low heat, melt the butter, add the leeks or onions, and cook until soft. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan. When the potatoes are done, drain them, reserving a cup of the cooking water. Mash the potatoes in the pot that you cooked them in with the cream cheese and milk or potato-cooking water. The mashed potatoes should be fairly stiff and not too smooth. Stir in 1 cup of the cheddar, the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and the mustard or nutmeg. Fold the cabbage, broccoli, and leeks into the potatoes until thoroughly mixed. Add the black pepper and season with more salt to taste. Spread the mixture into the prepared baking pan and top with the remaining cheddar cheese. Bake, uncovered, until thoroughly hot and golden brown, about 15 minutes.
