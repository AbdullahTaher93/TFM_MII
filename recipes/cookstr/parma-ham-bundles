Cut or tear each slice of Parma ham into two or three strips. Scissor each fig in half – if you’re not using the little Californian mission figs, which I found in packages at the supermarket, you may need to quarter them – and spread a teaspoon of goat’s cheese onto the cut half of the fig. Place the piece of fig cheese-side down on to the center of a strip of ham and then make it into a bundle. Sit each bulging pink parcel so that the darkness of the fig is hidden plate-side down.
