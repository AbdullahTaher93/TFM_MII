Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Remove the loose outer husk from the garlic. Cut the garlic crosswise about ¼ in (5mm) from the top to expose the flesh. Drizzle with the olive oil and wrap in foil. Roast the garlic for about 45 minutes, until tender. Squeeze the soft flesh out of the hulls into a small bowl. Mash with a fork and set aside. Season the grouse with salt and pepper. Top each with 1 tbsp of butter and a sprig of thyme. Wrap each grouse with 2 strips of bacon. Arrange the grouse in a roasting pan. Roast for 25–30 minutes, basting halfway through the roasting time. Transfer the grouse to a serving platter and cover to keep warm. Place the pan over high heat and stir in the wine. Add the remaining sprig of thyme and boil about 3 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced by half. Stir in the cream and boil, stirring often, about 5 minutes, until reduced and slightly thickened. Remove the thyme sprig. Stir the garlic flesh into the sauce and season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Serve the grouse hot, with the sauce on the side.
