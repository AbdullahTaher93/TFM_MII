The Process Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Mix the sesame seeds and oil, extra virgin olive oil, tamari and garlic together. Put all the vegetables in a large bowl and coat with the sesame and soy mix. Spread on an oiled baking sheet, sprinkle with fresh cracked pepper and roast for 20 minutes. Stir vegetables around on the tray with a spatula or wooden spoon and roast for 10-15 more minutes or until golden. If you have extra marinade you can store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks and use on chicken or fish. Great with the sesame and soy-brined chicken.
