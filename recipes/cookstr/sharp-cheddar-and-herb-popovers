Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Place 1 large or 2 small popover pans in the preheated oven (you’ll need 12 cups total). Meanwhile, heat the milk in a small saucepan over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until warm to the touch. Whisk the eggs, herbs, salt, and a generous grinding of pepper together in a large bowl. Add the warm milk while whisking to keep the milk from cooking the eggs. Sift the flour into the milk mixture and whisk well. Remove the pans from the oven and spray with vegetable spray, making sure the entire cups are well coated (popovers love to stick if you’re not fastidious). Fill each of the cups three-fourths full and sprinkle about 1 heaping tablespoon of cheese on top of each. Bake for 15 minutes. Carefully turn the pans from front to back and continue baking for another 25 minutes, or until the popovers have risen and are golden brown. Serve immediately.
