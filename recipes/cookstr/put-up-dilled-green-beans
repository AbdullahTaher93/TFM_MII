Lay a hot sterilized canning jar on its side, and slip in half of the green beans. Stand the jar up, and add 2 dill sprigs, ½ teaspoon celery seeds, 2 garlic cloves, 1 dried chile pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon peppercorns. Repeat with the other jar. Bring the vinegar, water, and pickling salt to a full rolling boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Pour the hot liquid into the two jars, dividing it evenly. Wipe away any spills from the jars’ lips. Screw on the lids and rings, and let them cool completely at room temperature. Let the pickled green beans stand for at least 4 weeks before serving.
