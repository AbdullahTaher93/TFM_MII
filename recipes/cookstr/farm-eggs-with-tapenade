Put the eggs in a large saucepan, add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 9 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water. When the eggs are cool, peel and halve. Scoop out the egg yolks and mash them in a bowl with the tapenade and mayonnaise until thoroughly combined. Spoon or pipe this mixture into the egg halves. Arrange on a plate and serve.
