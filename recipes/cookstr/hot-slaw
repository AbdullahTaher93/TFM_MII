Place the cream in a saucepan and reduce by one half over moderate heat. In a large pot, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the cabbage and toss to coat with the butter. Fold in the red pepper julienne. Continue to cook until the cabbage begins to wilt. In a bowl, whisk the mustard into the reduced cream. Season the cabbage with salt and pepper to taste. Fold in the cream mixture and sprinkle with the chopped parsley.
