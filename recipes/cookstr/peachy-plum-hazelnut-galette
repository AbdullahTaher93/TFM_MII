Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Place the chilled Hazelnut Pastry disk in the center of prepared pan. Cover with waxed paper and roll out to a 12-inch (30 cm) circle. In a large bowl, lightly toss together peaches, plums, hazelnut flour, ¼ cup (50 mL) sugar and cornstarch. Set aside. Carefully remove the waxed paper. Place the fruit mixture on pastry to within 2 inches (5 cm) of the edge. Dot with butter and sprinkle with hazelnuts. Carefully fold the pastry up over the filling to form a ragged edge, leaving fruit exposed in the center. Sprinkle pastry with 1 tbsp (15 mL) sugar. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer or until fruit is tender and pastry is lightly browned. Brush with jelly. Variation: Prepare the pastry with almond flour and sprinkle the prepared galette with sliced almonds. Almonds toast as the galette bakes.
