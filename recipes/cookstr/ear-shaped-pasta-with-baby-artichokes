Fill a large bowl with water and add the juice of the lemon. To trim the artichokes, peel back the outer leaves until they break off at the base. Keep removing leaves until you reach the pale green heart. Cut across the top of the heart to remove the pointed leaf tips. If the stem is still attached, cut it down to ½ inch, then trim the stem and base to remove any dark green or brown parts. Cut each heart into 6 or 8 wedges, then immediately place in the lemon water to prevent browning. Heat 6 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Drain the artichokes and add them to the skillet. Season with salt to taste and the hot pepper flakes. Add the wine and ¼ cup water. Bring the liquid to a simmer, then cover, adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook until the artichokes are very tender and beginning to break apart, 30 to 35 minutes. Uncover occasionally, stir, and add more water if the mixture threatens to cook dry. While the artichokes are cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When the artichokes are tender, stir in the garlic and parsley. Cook for a couple of minutes to release their flavor. Keep the artichokes warm over low heat. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta and return it to the warm pot over low heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss well, then add the artichokes. Toss again, divide the pasta among warm bowls, and sprinkle each portion with some of the bread crumbs. Pass the additional bread crumbs at the table.
