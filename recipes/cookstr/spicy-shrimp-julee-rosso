In a large skillet over low heat, heat the butter and olive oil. Add the garlic and shallots and saut√© for 2 minutes without browning. Add the shrimp, increase the heat slightly, and cook until the shrimp are just done, about 4 minutes. Add salt and pepper and toss well. Transfer to a bowl, scraping in all the sauce. Add the lemon juice and dill; toss together well. Cover and refrigerate 3 to 4 hours before serving. Adjust the seasonings and serve.
