In a stainless-steel saucepan, heat milk to the scalding point (see Notes) over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Add skim milk powder and stir until incorporated. Remove from heat and let cool to 110° to 120°F (43° to 49°C), stirring often. Cooling could take up to 1 hour. In a bowl, combine starter yogurt or freeze-dried yogurt culture with about ½ cup (125 mL) of the cooled milk. Add to remaining cooled milk and stir well to distribute yogurt culture. Pour into clean cups, secure lids if suggested by manufacturer, and place in yogurt maker. Set the time for 8 to 12 hours or minimum time recommended in manufacturer’s instructions. The longer yogurt ferments, the firmer and more tart it will be. Do not disturb the milk as it is fermenting. Check one container after 8 hours and, if yogurt has reached the desired consistency, remove cups from yogurt maker, secure lids, if necessary, and refrigerate immediately. If it is not set to your liking, replace test cup and ferment for another 1 to 2 hours, or until desired consistency is reached. Refrigeration stops the fermentation process. Let yogurt chill completely before serving or using in recipes.
