Using a mortar and pestle, coarsely crush the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and salt. Transfer to a large bowl and add the chili powder, turmeric, and flour. Add the water and mix until you have a thick, smooth batter. Let stand for 20 minutes. Add the cilantro and chiles (if desired) to the batter and mix well. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer, or heat at least 2 inches of oil (the more oil you use, the more stable the temperature of the oil) in a large, deep pot. Working in batches, add the vegetables to the batter: coating them thoroughly, then lift out, letting the excess drip off and fry until brown and crispy. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
