Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the shrimp and cook for about 1 minute, or until pink. (The exact time will depend on their size, be careful not to overcook them.) Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and run cold water over them to stop the cooking. Keep the water boiling and add the couscous. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. While the couscous is cooking, place the zucchini in a bowl, and add the garlic, red onion, scallions, and shrimp. Drain the couscous and run it under cold water to stop the cooking. Shake off as much excess water as possible and add the couscous to the bowl with the zucchini. Add the olive oil, cumin, lemon juice, and a squeeze of agave nectar; season with salt and pepper. Give it a good mix and check the seasoning. Add the herbs and mix again. Recheck the seasoning, adding more lemon juice if necessary.
