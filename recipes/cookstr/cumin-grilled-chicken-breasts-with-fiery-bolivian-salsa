Make the llajua: Stem and cut the chile(s) in half lengthwise, then slice them crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. (Gabrielâ€™s family is very specific about this way of cutting the chile.) For a milder llajua, seed the chiles; for a spicier one, leave the seeds in. Place the tomatoes, garlic, and chile(s) in a food processor and puree to a coarse paste. Work in the olive oil and wine vinegar. Season the llajua with salt and black pepper to taste; the salsa should be highly seasoned. Work in the cilantro, running the processor in short bursts. Alternatively, you can puree the ingredients in a blender, adding the cilantro at the very end. You will have about 1 1/2 cups. The llajua can be made up to 2 hours ahead. Prepare the chicken: Rinse the chicken breasts under cold running water, then blot them dry with paper towels. Generously season the chicken breasts on both sides with the salt, black pepper, and cumin. Drizzle the olive oil on both sides of the chicken breasts, rubbing the oil and spices onto the meat with your fingertips. Let the chicken breasts marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat it to high. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Arrange the chicken breasts on the hot grate at a diagonal to the bars. Grill the chicken breasts until golden brown and cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes per side for bone-in breasts, 3 to 5 minutes per side for boneless breasts. Give each breast a quarter turn on each side after 2 minutes to create a handsome crosshatch of grill marks. Transfer the grilled chicken breasts to a platter or plates. Serve the chicken with the llajua spooned on top or on the side.
