Lighlty toss the shrimp with half the seasoning. Preheat a large skillet over high heat, put the oil in the pan, and heat until the oil begins to smoke. Place the garlic and rosemary in the pan, and stir to lightly brown the garlic, being very careful not to burn it. Add the shrimp and stir carefully. Add the Worcestershire, hot sauce, lemon juice, and lemon quarters. Deglaze the pan with the beer, stirring to release any bits clinging to the bottom, and boil the mixture to reduce while shaking the pan. Allow the shrimp to cook for 2 to 2Â½ minutes (timing will depend on size) and add the remaining seafood seasoning, salt, and pepper. When the shrimp have finished cooking, the liquid should have a saucy consistency. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the butter a bit at a time, stirring, until the sauce is thick. Adjust seasoning. Remove lemon pieces.
