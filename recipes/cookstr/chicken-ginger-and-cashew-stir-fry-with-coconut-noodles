First, prepare the coconut noodles. Place the stock and coconut milk in a sucepan and bring to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to the instructions on the package. When cooked, drain. To prevent them from sticking together, add a couple of tablespoonfuls of the cooking liquid to the noodles. Cover and keep warm. Meanwhile, heat a wok until almost smoking, add the sesame and sunflower oils and the garlic and ginger. Cook for a few seconds, then add the chicken and cook for a few minutes, stirring regularly, until the outside is just golden. Add the carrots, snow peas and mushrooms, then toss and stir for another few minutes until the vegetables are just cooked but still slightly crunchy. Toss in the nuts and chopped cilantro and season. Serve on top of the noodles.
