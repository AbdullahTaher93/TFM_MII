1 Preheat the oven to 425°F. 2 Rinse the greens and steam in a wide skillet or Dutch oven for just a minute or so, until wilted. Transfer to a colander and drain well. 3 Combine the refried beans with a small amount of water in a mixing bowl–just enough to make the beans more spreadable. 4 Lay a tortilla on a baking sheet. Spread one half of it with a quarter of the refried beans, followed by a quarter of the greens and a quarter of the tomato slices. Fold over to cover. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, using an additional baking sheet if needed. 5 Bake for 10 minutes, or until the tortillas begin to turn golden and crisp. Watch carefully! 6 To serve, place each quesadilla or half of a quesadilla on an individual plate. Top with avocado slices. Serve at once, passing around salsa to top individual portions.
