Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly coat a 12-cup muffin pan with vegetable oil or clarified butter, or use a silicone muffin pan or paper liners, and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the water and flaxseed. Stir until well blended and let sit for 10 minutes. Add the milk, raisins, zucchini, molasses, sugar, applesauce, and butter. Stir until well blended. In another large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix well with a spoon just until combined. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Bake for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Let the muffins cool in the pan for no more than 2 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.
