Preheat the oven to 400Â°F, and lightly oil a sheet pan. Combine 2 tablespoons of the milk and the honey in a small saucepan over mediumlow heat, and stir until the honey is dissolved. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Sift all the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Add the butter and cut it into the dry ingredients using either a pastry blender or two forks, until coarse crumbs are formed. Add the crystallized ginger, the remaining milk and warm honey mixture to the flour and gently mix just until a soft dough is formed. Do not overmix. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 5 times. Roll out the dough to form a thick 8-inch square. Cut the square into quarters, diagonally. Cut each quarter in half to make triangles. Place the scones 1 inch apart on the sheet pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until they are lightly browned. Place them on a rack to cool and serve warm or at room temperature.
