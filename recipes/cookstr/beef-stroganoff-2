Heat a large, heavy skillet, preferably cast iron over high heat. Add the meat, a few pieces at a time, and quickly sear all sides, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. If the meat throws off too much liquid, drain it off and set aside. Remove the meat from the skillet and set aside. Melt the butter in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high, then add the mushrooms and sauté, stirring frequently, until they are deeply colored, about 20 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium-low. Sprinkle in the flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the stock, heavy cream, sour cream, mustard, and the meat juices, if any. Simmer over low heat until the sauce thickens, about 5 minute; do not allow to boil. Return the meat to the skillet, stir to coat with the sauce, and heat for 1 minute. Stir in the dill, parsley, salt, and pepper, and serve at once.
