Boil the wine, shallot, parsley, bay leaf, and peppercorns in a small saucepan. Then simmer slowly over high heat for 4â€“5 minutes, or until reduced by half. Remove from the heat. Strain the reduced liquid through a sieve into a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water and, whisking constantly, add the cubes of butter, 1 at a time. When it becomes an emulsified sauce it is ready to use. Season with salt and pepper.
