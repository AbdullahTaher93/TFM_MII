Heat the butter in a 4-quart saucepan over low heat. Add the onion, garlic, curry, salt, hot pepper flakes, and black pepper and saute until the onion is softened, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Add the broth, lentils, and coconut. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow soup to cool slightly. Add lime juice. Process in a blender or food processor by pulsing a few times to puree, but not until smooth. The recipe can be made ahead until this point. Refrigerate until ready to continue. Reheat before serving. Taste and adjust seasoning. Garnish with a dollop of plain low-fat yogurt sprinkled with lime zest.
