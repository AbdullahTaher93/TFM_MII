In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, mascarpone, and the honey until smooth. Reserve for topping. Preheat the grill, roll out and shape the dough, and grill the first side of the crust per the Master Instructions on for gas or for charcoal (see Notes). Use tongs to transfer it to a peel or rimless baking sheet. Flip the crust to reveal the grilled side. Spread the entire surface with the jam. Artfully arrange the fig slices on top and sprinkle with the ham and walnuts. Spoon small dollops of the ricotta-mascarpone mixture over the top. Finish grilling the pizza per the Master Instructions (see Notes). Remove from the grill and season with pepper. Since the ham is salty, taste first, then salt only if necessary. Slice and serve immediately.
