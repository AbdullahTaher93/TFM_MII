Stir in the broth and saffron, cook for a minute to evaporate some of the liquid, and remove to a dish. Wipe out the skillet. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in the skillet and add the potato slices, one at a time so they don’t stick together. Sprinkle with salt. Give the potatoes a turn, cover, and cook over low heat until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes, lifting and turning occasionally. Spoon on the onions, sprinkle with parsley, and serve. VARIATION Omitting the onion, broth, and saffron, cook the potatoes in 3 tablespoons oil as indicated (the potatoes may be cubed instead of sliced). In a mortar mash to a paste 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley with 1/8 teaspoon kosher or sea salt and 2 minced garlic cloves. Stir in ¼ teaspoon paprika, 2 tablespoons chicken broth, and 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar and pour over the potatoes when they are done.
