Place the bread in a bowl, add cold water to cover, and let soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the bread and squeeze out the excess liquid. Place the soaked bread and the chopped tomatoes, strawberries, green pepper, and fennel in a large bowl. Toss to mix and let stand for 15 minutes. Working in two batches, place the vegetable mixture in a food processor and process until smooth, adding half of the olive oil to each batch. Once each batch is finished, puree it finely in a blender, then transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Add the spring water and garlic (the gazpacho should have the consistency of a smoothie). Season the soup with salt to taste and refrigerate it, covered, until chilled, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, place the finely diced tomato, strawberries, green pepper, and fennel in a bowl and toss to mix. Spoon the diced tomato mixture into shallow bowls and ladle the chilled gazpacho on top. Drizzle olive oil over the surface and serve.
