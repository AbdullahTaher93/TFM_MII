Béchamel sauce: Use 2/3 cup of chicken stock and only ½ cup of cream if you wish. Melt the butter and add the arrowroot, or if this is unavailable, add well-sifted flour. Blend these well and cook for a minute. Stir in the cream and stock gradually and stir with a wire whisk. Once the sauce reaches the boiling point, simmer it for a minute or two. Chicken croquettes: Mix the chicken with seasonings and add 2/3 cup of the sauce. Allow this to cool, shape into balls, and fry. Ham croquettes: Mix the ham and seasonings and add 1/2 cup of the sauce. Blend well, form into balls, dip in beaten egg and breadcrumbs, and fry. Codfish croquettes: Mix the shredded codfish and the mashed potatoes well. Add the seasonings and the well-beaten egg. Form into balls and dip in egg and breadcrumbs and fry.
