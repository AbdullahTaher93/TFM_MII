Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the tempeh and cook until browned all over, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the tempeh with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the vegetarian sausage links to the same skillet and cook until browned all over, about 5 minutes. Remove the links with a slotted spoon and set aside with the tempeh. Reheat the same skillet over medium heat, adding a little more oil if necessary. Add the onion, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion to a 3Â½- to 4-quart slow cooker. Add the potatoes, sauerkraut, wine, paprika, caraway seeds, and juniper berries. Pour in the stock, season with salt and pepper, cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours. About 20 minutes before serving time, add the tempeh and vegetarian sausage links to the cooker and stir gently to combine.
