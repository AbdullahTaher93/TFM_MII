In a medium-size saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the shallot and garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes. Off the heat, add the peanut butter, coconut milk, brown sugar, sambal oelek, and ginger and whisk until pasty. Gradually whisk in the water and simmer over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then whisk in the lime juice and peanuts and season with salt. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled. Will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
