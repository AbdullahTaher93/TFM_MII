Put water in a medium saucepan over high heat and bring to boil. Stir in tofu and green onions. Reduce heat to low and cook, uncovered, 3 minutes. Put miso in a small strainer, lower into soup, and push paste through strainer with a spoon until it dissolves. Turn off heat. Miso should not be boiled or overcooked because too much heat destroys its enzymatic properties. Stir in cilantro and lemon juice. Serve immediately. For Japanese Miso Soup: Follow method described for Lemony Miso Soup, adding wakame at the end.
