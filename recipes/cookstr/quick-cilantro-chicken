Rinse the chicken breasts and pat dry. Combine the garlic, oil, mustard, and cilantro (see Notes). Generously coat the chicken pieces. Preheat the grill, stovetop grill, or a heavy, seasoned skillet. Add the chicken and cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side, turning only once, when the chicken starts to curl at the edges and feels firm to the touch. Serve garnished with a lime wedge, if desired.
