TO GRILL THE FISH: Prepare a charcoal fire, allowing the coals to produce a medium-hot fire or preheat a gas grill to medium hot. Season the salmon with salt and pepper. Grill for 6 to 8 minutes per side. (To check for doneness, make a small incision in the fish, if it is opaque all the way through, it is done.) It should be taken off the grill a little before you think it is done as it will keep cooking for a few minutes afterwards. You do not want the salmon to be dry. TO ROAST THE FISH: Preheat oven to 375Â°F. In one or two large, heavy, ovenproof skillets, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. When it gets hot, add the salmon, skin side down. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until you can see that it is turning pale pink. Flip it over carefully with two spatulas (if the skin sticks to the bottom of the pan, scrape it off and discard). Add the garlic and a splash of the wine. Transfer the skillet(s) to the oven and roast the fish for 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the salmon to a warm platter. If the skin is still on, peel it off and discard it. In a medium-sized skillet, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the green onions, peas, and wine. Swirl the pan a few times and add the mint. Once the pea mixture is warm, a couple of minutes, pour it over the fish and serve with lemon wedges on the side.
