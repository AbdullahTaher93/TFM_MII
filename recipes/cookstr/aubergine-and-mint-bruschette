For the Basic Bruschetta: For the Basic Bruschetta: If you have a large loaf, cut it in half, then slice it crossways about a half-inch thick. Grill these slices on a grill or in a griddle pan until they are crisp on both sides, then lightly rub each piece a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic. Drizzle with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a tiny pinch of salt. You can eat the toasted bread just like this, but make sure the oil is the best you can find, otherwise it will never taste good. For the Aubergine and Mint: For the Aubergine and Mint: Heat a griddle pan until nice and hot. Lay your aubergine slices on it side by side and when they are nicely charred on both sides, put them into a bowl. You will probably need to do this in several batches. While the aubergines are grilling, put 8 tablespoons of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of vinegar, with the parsley, mint and garlic, into another bowl and season with salt and pepper. When the aubergines are all done, add them to the dressing and mix around, then check the seasoning again and divide onto the bruschetta. Press the topping into the toast so all the lovely flavour gets sucked in!
