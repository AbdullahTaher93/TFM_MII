Combine all ingredients except whole milk in a blender. Cover and process at medium-low speed until smooth. Add whole milk; blend at low speed until combined. Cover and chill until very cold, at least 3 hours. Stir well before serving in small glasses without ice; dust servings with additional ground cinnamon, if desired.
