Preheat the oven to 500Â°F. If you are using a pizza stone, place it in the oven. Sprinkle a 14-inch pizza pan with cornmeal. If you are using a pizza stone, sprinkle cornmeal on a wooden peel (paddle) or a rimless baking sheet. Set aside. In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat just until the edges begin to brown but the bacon is still soft and pliable, about 6 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Prepare the Pizza Dough. Brush the rim of the dough with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Distribute the cheese over the dough and sprinkle with the bacon pieces. Bake for 5 minutes. Scatter the tomatoes over the surface of the pizza and continue baking until the cheese is golden-brown and bubbly and the bacon is crisp, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Serve immediately.
