Heat the oil in a 5-quart Dutch oven. In batches, add the chicken and cook over medium-high heat, turning often, until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside. Add the onions to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Then add the garlic, curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and cayenne. Stir for 1 minute, and then stir in the chicken broth and tomato sauce. Return the chicken thighs to the Dutch oven and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover tightly, and simmer until the chicken shows no sign of pink at the bone when prodded with the tip of a sharp knife, about 45 minutes. In a small bowl, blend the peanut butter with about 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Stir this mixture back into the sauce, and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
