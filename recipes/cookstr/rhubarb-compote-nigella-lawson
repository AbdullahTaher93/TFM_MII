Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Cut the rhubarb into 1 inch pieces and place in an ovenproof dish. Sprinkle over the sugar, add the orange zest, mix with your hands, and cover with foil. Bake in the oven for 45 minutes to an hour, by which time the fruit should be soft but still holding its shape and its glorious pink color. Remove the foil and decant into another dish to cool.
