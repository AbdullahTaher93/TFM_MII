Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Unwrap an end of a chilled stick of unsalted butter and rub it over two large cool Teflon-coated baking sheets to apply a very thin film of fat. Put the butter, com syrup, and sugar in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir over low heat until the butter is melted. Remove from heat, and stir in the nuts and flour. Drop five or six ½ teaspoonsful of batter 1½ inches apart on each baking sheet. A quick and easy method is to pipe the soft dough from a 14-inch pastry bag fitted with a ½-inch plain decorating tip (such as Ateco #6). Bake, one sheet at a time, for 6 to 7 minutes, or until golden brown. While baking, the cookies bubble; a clue that they are finished baking is when the bubbling subsides. Place baking sheet on a wire rack to cool for just 15 seconds. With a metal spatula, lift one wafer at a time and roll it around a wooden cone to shape the cookie while it is still flexible. Remove cone from the form, and place it on a wire rack to cool; continue rolling the remaining cookies. Repeat the baking and shaping process with the remaining batter. When the cookies are cool and firm, stack them in an airtight metal container and store at room temperature up to 1 week.
