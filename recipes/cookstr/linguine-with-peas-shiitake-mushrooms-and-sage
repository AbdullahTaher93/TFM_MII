Soak the porcini mushrooms in the hot water for 15 minutes, then strain through a paper towel-lined sieve, reserving the soaking liquid. Set the mushrooms and soaking liquid aside. Cook the linguine according to the package directions. Drain and set aside. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the drained porcinis and the shiitakes and cook, stirring a few times, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the sage and stir to coat. Add the peas, broth, and reserved porcini soaking liquid, bring to a simmer, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Add the linguine and toss to combine. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a warm serving platter and, using a vegetable peeler, shave the cheese over the top right before serving.
