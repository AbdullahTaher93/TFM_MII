Combine all the ingredients in the heavy saucepan and bring to a simmer over moderate heat. When the berries begin to pop, reduce the heat to very low, cover, and continue to cook, stirring from time to time to prevent sticking for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve the relish warm with flapjacks, buckwheat cakes, game meats, birds, or sausages.
