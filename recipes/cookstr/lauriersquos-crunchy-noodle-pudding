Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9 × 13-inch baking dish. Cook the noodles in a pot of lightly salted boiling water with a little oil until soft but not mushy. Drain, return to the pot, and toss with the 2 tablespoons margarine. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and cream cheese. Add the eggs, milk, vanilla, raisins, and melted margarine and mix well. Add the cooked noodles and toss with a wooden spoon. Pour the noodles into the prepared baking dish. To make the topping, combine all the ingredients in a medium-size bowl, mixing well. Spread evenly over the noodles. 5. Bake until the top is golden brown and crunchy, 45 to 60 minutes. Serve hot.
