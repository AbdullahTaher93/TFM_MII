Separate the pork chop; and lay them out on a large platter or work board. Heat a large saute pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. (The pan should be large enough to fit all 4 pork chops comfortably.) When heated, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Once the oil is very hot, add the pork chops. Cook the pork chops until brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from pan, cover with foil and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium and add another 1 to 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Once hot, stir in the tomatoes, pepper, carrot, celery, onion and garlic. Cook for 3 minutes; stirring frequently with a wooden spoon. Add the salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, thyme and basil. Mix to combine. Return the pork chops to the pan and top with the tomato mixture. Pour in the wine or both, then cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.
