Bring a medium-size pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, cut the broccoli into bite-size florets; peel and dice the stalks, if you like. When the water boils, drop in the broccoli and boil just until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, then immediately spread on a baking sheet or platter to cool. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. In a large bowl, whisk the yogurt, mayonnaise, parsley, basil, mustards, and vinegar together. Add the celery, chickpeas, onion, cheese, and broccoli and toss together well seasoning with pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving. Just before serving, toss again with the croutons, if youâ€™re using them.
