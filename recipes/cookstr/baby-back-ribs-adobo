In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves, and jalapeño. Arrange the ribs in a baking pan and season them with the salt. Using a mortar and pestle, gently pound the garlic cloves and peppercorns until they are combined and coarsely ground. Rub the spices into the pork. Pour the vinegar mixture over the ribs, turning the meat to coat evenly with the liquid. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. When you’re ready to cook the ribs, transfer the ribs and marinade to a large, heavy saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and cook until the meat is tender and falling off the bone, about 1 hour. Transfer the ribs to a plate. Increase the heat to high and cook the marinade, uncovered, until it is reduced to a medium-thick sauce, 5 to 10 minutes more. If the sauce is still thin, simmer for a few more minutes until thickened. Discard the bay leaves and jalapeño. While you’re reducing the sauce, preheat the broiler. Transfer the ribs to a broiler pan lined with foil. Pour the sauce over the ribs. Broil the ribs until nicely browned, 3 to 5 minutes on each side.
