Place all the ingredients except the parsley, in a blender or food processor and process on low speed until very smooth. Stop the machine and scrape the sides of the container with a rubber spatula, if necessary, to make sure all the ingredients are processed. Lightly grease and flour an 8-inch cake pan. Pour the mixture into the pan and bake in a preheated 350Â°F oven for 45 minutes, or until set. Place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours. Cover if it will be refrigerated for an extended period. To serve, cut the pate into little squares or diamonds and garnish with a sprinkling of parsley. Accompany with hot, crusty whole-grain bread or crackers.
