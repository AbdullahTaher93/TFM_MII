Line a 9-inch pie pan with crust and then pinch edge to form a lip. Bake the crust as directed in the recipe. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and 1/3 cup cold water. Stir with a spoon to combine them well, dissolving any lumps. In a medium saucepan, combine the chopped strawberries, sugar, and salt. Stir to combine the fruit and sugar, and then cook over medium heat until the mixture comes to a gentle boil. Cook, stirring often, until the berries create a pool of sauce, about 5 minutes. Stir up the cornstarch-water mixture, and add it to the pan. Cook, stirring often, until the strawberry sauce boils again, thickens up, and the berries are soft, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from the heat, stir in the butter and vanilla, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Beat the cream in a large bowl until it is very thick and luscious, holding its shape in round medium peaks that are not cottony-stiff. Stir in the strawberry jam mixture and gently fold the cream and jam together to make an even, rich mixture. Pile the filling into the graham cracker crust and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours, until very cold and fairly firm. Serve cold, and if you have sliced strawberries, spoon a small pile of them alongside each piece of pie. Refrigerate any remaining pie for up to 1 day.
