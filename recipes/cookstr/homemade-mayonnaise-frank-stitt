Combine the mustard, egg yolk, cayenne, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk vigorously for 30 seconds. Slowly add the oil drop by drop, adding more only after the previous addition has been incorporated: Be careful not to add the oil too quickly or the mayonnaise will “break,” or curdle. Thin with a little water if needed. Add the lemon juice, then taste and adjust the seasoning. (This will keep for up to 5 days, covered and refrigerated.)
