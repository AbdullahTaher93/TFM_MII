Stem and wash the kale, shaking off excess water. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the kale until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the kale, then plunge it into a large bowl of ice water. Drain again and, using your hands, squeeze most of the water out. The greens don’t need to be completely dry. Roughly chop the kale and set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the sherry and the raisins over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat and set aside to steep for at least 10 minutes. In a sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, another minute or two. Add the kale, sherry, raisins, anchovies, orange juice and zest, and red pepper flakes. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low, and cook until the flavors are blended, about 10 minutes. Remove the cover, raise the heat to medium-high, and boil away most of the excess liquid. Remove from the heat. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Top each of the toasts with some of the greens, either warm or at room temperature, and top with shavings of Parmesan. Arrange the toasts on a platter and serve.
