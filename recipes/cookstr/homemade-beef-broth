Preheat the oven to 450Â°. Put the bones into a roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes until well browned. Add the vegetables and return to the oven until they are also browned. Transfer everything to a broth pot. Add the bouquet garni, spices, garlic, and tomato puree. Degrease the pan and deglaze with some of the water, bring to a boil and pour into the broth pot. Add the rest of the water and bring slowly to a boil. Skim off the fat and simmer gently for 5-6 hours. Strain, cool, and skim off any remaining fat before use.
