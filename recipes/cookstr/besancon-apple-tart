Apricot Glaze: Melt the apricot jelly in a small stainless steel saucepan with 1-2 tablespoons lemon juice or water. Push the hot jelly through a nylon strainer and store in a sterilized airtight jar. Warm and stir the glaze before use if necessary. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Make the gluten-free pastry following the recipe and refrigerate for 1 hour. Line the pan (or pans) with the pastry and chill for 10 minutes. Line with parchment paper and dried beans and bake blind for 15–20 minutes. Remove the paper and beans, brush the tart with a little egg wash and return to the oven for 3-4 minutes. Leave to cool, then brush the base with apricot glaze. Peel the apples, quarter, core, and cut into even slices about 1/8in thick. Arrange the slices as you go to form a circle inside the tart, with the slices slightly overlapping on the inside. Fill the center likewise. Whisk the eggs well with the sugar and the vanilla extract. Add the cream and strain this mixture over the apples. Bake in the oven for about 35 minutes. When the custard is set and the apples are fully cooked, brush generously with apricot glaze. (This is essential for flavor, not just for appearance.) Serve warm with a bowl of whipped cream.
