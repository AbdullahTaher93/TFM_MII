1.?Rinse the kale and pat it dry with a paper towel. Remove the kale stalks, tear the leaves into half inch pieces, and dry in a salad spinner to wick away any excess moisture. Massage the leaves gently to bring out their full color and nutrients. 2.?In a large serving bowl, combine the kale, tomatoes, red onion, and seeds and toss well. 3.?Add the Tahini Dressing 4 to 6 hours before serving in order to soften the leaves. Toss well and store in the refrigerator until serving. Serve in small bowls. Cooks' Note: Use other veggies as they are seasonally available. Try to maintain a color variety for aesthetic and nutritional balance. 1.?In a small mixing bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients except the water. 2.?Slowly add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, while whisking constantly. Keep in mind that Tahini Dressing thickens over time, so you may want to add a little more water than you initially think. Add the water until you feel the dressing has reached the right consistency and taste for your needs. Use immediately or store in a jar for 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Shake well before serving after storage.
