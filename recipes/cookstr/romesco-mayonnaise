Heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a saucepan over low heat. Add the garlic and cook until pale gold, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the garlic with a mesh skimmer and set aside in a small bowl. Add the almonds to the pan, raise the heat slightly, and cook, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the almonds to the garlic. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the bell peppers and onions and cook, stirring, over medium-low heat until they are very soft, 15 minutes. Add the tomatoes, orange zest, and orange juice. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes to blend the flavors. Add the garlic and almonds and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then puree in a food processor or blender. Stir this mixture into the mayonnaise and refrigerate, covered, until ready to use. It will keep for up to 3 days.
