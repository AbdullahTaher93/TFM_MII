In a 2-quart saucepan, melt all but 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat, but don’t let it brown. Strain the clams through a sieve and reserve the clam broth. When the butter is melted, stir in the thyme, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and salt. Cook for a minute, then add the clam broth and turn the heat to high, stirring occasionally until the mixture reaches a boil. Lower the heat and add the cream, stirring—be careful not to let the cream boil. When the cream is hot, add the clams, stir again, and cook for 2 minutes. Ladle the stew into 4 heated bowls. Squeeze a little lemon juice into each bowl. Divide the remaining butter in quarters and drop a piece in the center of each portion. Sprinkle a ring of paprika around the butter and add an outer ring of the snipped greens. Serve immediately.
