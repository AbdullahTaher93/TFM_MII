Before making the dressing, fill a small pot with cold water and bring to a boil. Add the egg in the shell, turn off heat, and cook for 2 minutes. Separate the egg and discard the white. Combine the salt, pepper, garlic, anchovies, Dijon, lemon juice, Worcestershire, and vinegar in a blender and process until smooth. Add the oil and pulse a few times. Add the coddled yolk and pulse a couple more times-just enough to blend it without causing the dressing to become like mayonnaise. This will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
