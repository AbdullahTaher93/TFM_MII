Pour the cold water into a large pot. Add the chicken, garlic, onion, carrots, celery, parsley, bay leaf, salt, and peppercorns and slowly bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 4 hours, skimming frequently. Strain the soup. Discard the onion, parsley, bay leaf, and peppercorns but reserve the other vegetables. Remove the chicken, skin and debone it, and reserve the meat. Return the chicken stock, chicken meat, carrots, celery, and garlic to the pot and bring back to a simmer; season with additional salt or pepper, to taste. Serve the soup in big bowls over pastina, rice, or spaghettini. The soup’s curative powers are released only when the vegetables are mashed together in the bowl. Use a fork for mashing. Use a big spoon for eating. You’ll feel better soon.
