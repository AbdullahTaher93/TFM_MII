. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Peel and chop the vegetables into wedges. Put them in a roasting pan, season them, then give them a healthy shower of olive oil. Cook them for about 30 minutes, turning them a couple of times. Five minutes before they are ready, put the walnuts on a cookie sheet, pop in the oven and toast them. Pour the vegetables into a dish and sprinkle the feta on top. Make a dressing with the olive oil, parsley, balsamic vinegar, mustard and a squeeze of lemon juice, if you like. Dress the vegetables and sprinkle the warm toasted walnuts on top.
