Sift flour with baking soda, salt and spices and set aside. Cream sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well between additions. Resift flour in gradually, alternating with sour cream and beating well between additions. Fold in raisins or currants. Butter a 9-inch loaf pan, a 9-inch square pan or a 9-inch fluted tube pan and sprinkle inside with fine bread crumbs, tapping excess out. Turn batter into pan and bake in preheated 325Â° oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until a tester comes out clean. Cool until cake shrinks from sides of pan, then invert onto a rack and cool completely.
