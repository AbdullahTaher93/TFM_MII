Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Butter an 11½ × 8in (29 × 20cm) baking dish. Combine the peaches, blueberries, sugar, and lemon zest in the dish. Sift the flour, 1/3 cup of the sugar, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. Beat the buttermilk and egg together. Stir into the flour mixture to make a soft, sticky dough. Drop walnut-sized spoonfuls of the dough over the fruit, leaving a little space between each one. Sprinkle with the almonds and the remaining 1 tbsp of sugar. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the juices are bubbling and a wooden toothpick inserted into the topping comes out clean. Let cool briefly and serve hot or cooled until warm.
