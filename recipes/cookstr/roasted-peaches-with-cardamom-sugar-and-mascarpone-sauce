Make the mascarpone sauce: In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with a whisk or an electric beater until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the mascarpone. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff but not dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold the egg whites and cognac into the mascarpone mixture until incorporated. Refrigerate the sauce for 2 hours before serving. Make the roasted peaches: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a large ceramic or glass-baking dish. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut an “X” through the skin at the bottom of each peach. Plunge the peaches in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove the peaches from the water and place in a bowl of cold water to keep them from cooking. When the peaches are cool enough to handle, cut them in half, remove the pits and then peel off the skins. Place the peaches cut side down in the prepared dish. Squeeze the lemons over the peaches. Sprinkle the butter over the peaches. Combine the sugar and ground cardamom and then sprinkle the mixture over the peaches. Add the sauterne to the dish. Cover the dish and bake the peaches for 30 minutes. Place two peach halves cut side up on each of 6 serving dishes. Spoon the extra juice from the baking dish over the peaches. Spoon some mascarpone sauce over each peach and serve warm.
