In a mixing bowl, combine the lamb and pork fat with the garlic, parsley, sage, rosemary, salt, and pepper and mix well. Using about ¼ cup of mixture for each patty, shape into 12 small round patties about ¾-inch thick. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage patties and reduce the heat to medium. Brown the patties evenly on both sides for about 5 minutes, turning once. The patties should be served medium rare. Place on paper toweling and pat dry. Serve immediately with the raw oysters.
