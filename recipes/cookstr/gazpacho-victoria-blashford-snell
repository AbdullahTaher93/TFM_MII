Place the tomatoes in a heatproof bowl, add enough boiling water to cover, and let stand for 20 seconds or until the skins split. Drain and rinse under cold running water to cool. Gently peel off the skins. Cut the tomatoes in half, and use a teaspoon to remove the cores and seeds. Chop the flesh. Purèe the tomato flesh, cucumber, red pepper, vinegar, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste in a food processor. Pour in the olive oil and process again. Dilute with a little water if too thick. Transfer the soup to a serving bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 1 hour. Serve the gazpacho with bowls of the tomatoes, cucumber, red pepper, egg yolk and white, and a cruet of olive oil, to add as garnishes. 2.
