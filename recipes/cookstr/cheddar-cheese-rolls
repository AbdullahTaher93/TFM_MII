In work bowl fitted with shredding blade, shred cheese. Transfer to a small bowl. Transfer 2 tbsp (25 mL) to a separate bowl, cover and refrigerate. Set remaining cheese aside. In a small saucepan, bring water and butter to a simmer until an instant-read thermometer registers approximately 120° to 130°F (50° to 55°C), about 3 minutes. Do not let boil. Meanwhile, in same work bowl fitted with metal dough blade, process 2 cups (500 mL) of the flour, sugar, yeast and salt until well combined, about 15 seconds. With the motor running, slowly add hot water mixture through the feed tube into work bowl. Add egg and all but 2 tbsp (25 mL) cheese and process until incorporated, about 5 seconds. With the motor continuing to run, spoon additional flour through the feed tube, ¼ cup (50 mL) at time, until dough starts to pull away from sides and begins to gather and a soft, not sticky, dough forms. Remove from work bowl and place on a floured surface. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 3 to 5 minutes. Shape into a ball. Transfer to a large oiled bowl and turn to coat all over. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until double in volume, about 45 to 90 minutes, depending on humidity and heat factors. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Punch down dough, form into 12 round rolls and place on prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Top with grated cheese. Cover with a towel and let rest in a warm, draft-free place until they rise slightly, 15 to 20 minutes. Top with reserved refrigerated grated cheese. Bake in preheated oven until light brown and cheese is bubbling, 12 to 18 minutes. Let cool on wire rack. Variation: Try Swiss or Monterey Jack cheese in place of the Cheddar cheese.
