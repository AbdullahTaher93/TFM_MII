Soak the chia seeds in the Â½ cup water for at least 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a sheet pan or line with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, combine the buckwheat flour, tapioca flour, arrowroot, flax meal, salt, and xanthan gum. In a separate large mixing bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), dissolve the yeast in the room temperature water. Add the maple syrup and olive oil. Just as the yeast begins to foam and feed on the maple syrup, about 3 minutes, add the combined dry ingredients and the chia seeds with their soaking liquid. Mix together until you have achieved a soft dough. This will not take long. You can do this by hand with a strong arm and a sturdy spoon, or with your stand mixer and the paddle attachment pulsed on low speed. On a work surface generously dusted with brown rice flour, turn out the dough and gently form into a round boule shape. Place on the prepared sheet pan and score by cutting 3 curves stemming from one point, just like a beautiful tree branch might look. Place in the hot oven. Once the oven door is closed, decrease the temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 1 hour. Decrease the temperature to 300 degrees F and bake for an additional 1 hour, until dark brown and crusty.
