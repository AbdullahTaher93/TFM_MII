Position the oven racks so that the top rack is 4 to 5 inches below the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to convection bake at 300°F. Coat a shallow roasting pan with nonstick cooking spray and place the ham in the pan. Place the pan on the top rack and bake for 1 hour. Take the ham out of the oven and smear it with a generous coating of mustard. Mix the bread crumbs, brown sugar, and ginger together and pat a generous coating evenly over the whole ham. Return the ham to the oven and bake for about 30 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Ham with Ancho-Honey Mustard Glaze Bake the ham for 1½ hours at 300°F, then coat with a mixture of 1 cup honey, ¼ cup Dijon mustard, and 2 teaspoons ground ancho chile powder (see page 206), and continue baking for 5 to 10 more minutes, until the glaze is shiny.
