In a large pot of boiling salted water, blanch green beans for 5 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, lift beans out of the boiling water. Plunge into ice cold water. Drain and set aside. Return pot to the heat and bring water back to a boil. Add pappardelle and cook for 8 to 12 minutes or until al dente. Drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside. In a bowl, whisk together oil and lemon juice. Using a fork, mix in mint leaves, green onions, garlic and tomatoes. Add green beans, pappardelle and cannellini beans. Toss to coat beans and pasta with oil mixture. Divide salad evenly among 4 plates. In a bowl, combine goat cheese and yogurt. Spoon a dollop over top of each salad.
