In a small bowl, soak the seaweed in water for 10 minutes. Drain. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the dashi or stock just to a simmer. Remove from the heat. Whisk in 2 tablespoons (32 g) of the miso paste until it is fully dissolved, then add the remaining 2 tablespoons (32 g) and dissolve. Dress with scallions, mushrooms, and tofu. Serve immediately.
