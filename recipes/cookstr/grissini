Mix the flour, oil, sugar, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl. Add ½ cup water and stir to make a soft dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface for 10 minutes. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat, and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place about 1 hour, until doubled. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Briefly knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Break off pieces of the dough about the size of a walnut and roll each piece into a long stick about the thickness of a pencil. Place the grissini about ½ in (1cm) apart on the baking sheets. Brush the bread sticks with the beaten egg and sprinkle them liberally with sesame seeds and coarse sea salt. Do not let the dough rise after shaping. Bake the grissini for 12-15 minutes, or until golden and crisp. The sticks should snap easily when broken and not be doughy in the middle. Transfer to a wire rack and leave until completely cooled.
