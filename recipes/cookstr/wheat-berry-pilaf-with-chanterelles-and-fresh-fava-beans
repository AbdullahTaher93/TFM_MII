Melt the butter in the pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add the chanterelles and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to wilt, about 1 minute. Add the wheat berries and broth, lock on the lid, and bring to pressure over high heat, about 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes to finish cooking. While the wheat berries sit bring a small pot of water to a boil. Drop in the fava beans and, as soon as the water returns to a boil, drain. Rinse the beans with cool water and peel away the skins with your fingers. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure from the pressure cooker pot. Remove the lid and boil a little longer if the berries are not cooked. Stir in the fava beans and tarragon. Serve right away.
