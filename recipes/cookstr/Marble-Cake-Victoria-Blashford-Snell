Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter and flour the pan, tapping out the excess flour. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. One at a time, beat in the eggs, beating well after each, then beat in the vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. On low speed, beat in half the flour mix. Beat in the milk, then the remaining flour mix. Spoon one-third of the batter into the pan. Transfer half the batter into another bowl. Sift in the cocoa powder and stir. Spoon dollops of the cocoa batter into the pan, then top with the plain batter. Swirl a knife through the two batters to create a pattern, taking care not to over-mix. Bake for about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove. Dust with confectioner's sugar and serve. Inspired by the European turban pan mold, with a pattern that resembles the folds of a turban, this cake pan comes in many other intricate shapes. Inspired by the European Kuglehopf cake pan, the Bundt pan takes its name from Bund, German for a gathering of people.
