To make the dressing, pur√®e the mango, oil, lime zest, and juice in a food processor or blender. Season with salt and pepper, adding a little water if too thick. Toss the shallot, cilantro, and mint with the salad greens in a large bowl. Add a few spoonfuls of dressing and toss again. Divide among 4 plates and top each with equal amounts of crab and avocado. Serve at once, passing the rest of the dressing on the side. 2. Toss the shallot, cilantro, and mint with the salad greens in a large bowl. Add a few spoonfuls of dressing and toss again.
