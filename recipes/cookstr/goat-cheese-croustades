Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Trim the crusts from the bread. Flatten the slices with a rolling pin, and brush with the melted butter. Using a 2 in (5cm) round cookie cutter, stamp out 3 pieces from each slice of bread. Push the bread, butter-side down, firmly into a 12-cup mini-muffin pan. Bake for about 12 minutes, or until well crisped. Remove the croustades from the pan and let cool on a wire rack. Cut each cherry tomato in half. Spread on a baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 25 minutes, until the tomatoes are shriveled. Let cool. Divide the goat cheese among the croustades. Top each with a tomato half, and garnish with mint leaves. Serve immediately.
