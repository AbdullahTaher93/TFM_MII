Prepare the sauce: In a large saucepan or deep heavy skillet, cook the onion, carrot, and celery in the olive oil over medium heat until golden and tender, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato, cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer. Prepare the meatballs: Place the meatball ingredients in a large bowl. With your hands, thoroughly mix together all of the ingredients. Rinse your hands in cool water to prevent sticking, then lightly shape the mixture into 2-inch balls. Transfer the meatballs into the simmering sauce. Cover and cook, turning the meatballs occasionally, until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.
