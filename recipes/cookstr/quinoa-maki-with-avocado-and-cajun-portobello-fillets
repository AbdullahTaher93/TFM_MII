To Make the Muhrooms: Place a large pot over medium heat. Sprinkle the bottom with a pinch of salt and heat for 1 minute. Add the oil and heat for 1 minute, being careful not to let it smoke. This will create a nonstick effect. Add the shallots and garlic and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened. Add 1 tablespoon of the Cajun seasoning, along with the wine, vinegar, and 1 cup water, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for 1 minute. Pour the mushrooms and liquid into a shallow container, cover, and set aside to marinate for 1 hour. Remove the mushrooms from the marinade and press between paper towels or in a cotton dish towel to remove the excess marinade, then sprinkle with the remaining Cajun seasoning, pressing the seasoning into both sides of the mushroom slices. Discard the marinade. In a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, cook the mushrooms in a single layer (you may have to do this in two batches) until blackened, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove to a plate. To Assemble the Maki: In a small bowl, mix together the vegan mayonnaise and sambal oelek. Set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together the quinoa, vinegar, and sugar. Spread a thin layer of the mixture on a sheet of nori, covering the sheet except for a 1-inch space along the far edge of the sheet. On the full length of the near end of the nori sheet, place single strips of avocado and portobello, a sprinkle of scallions, and small dollops of the sambal mixture. 8 Moisten the clean edge of the nori sheet with a bit of water. Beginning at the filled end, roll up the nori sheet very tightly (you may want to use a sushi mat). Press firmly when you get to the moistened edge to seal the roll. Repeat with the remaining nori and filling, Cut each roll into 6 pieces. Serve with soy sauce for dipping.
