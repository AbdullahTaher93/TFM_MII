In a large saucepan, stir together the salt, sugar, cloves, peppercorns, and allspice. Add the ginger and bay leaves along with the apple cider and hot water. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Boil for 3 minutes, then remove from the heat. Add the ice water and orange pieces and stir to cool the mixture. Set aside and let cool to room temperature. Proceed with brining the turkey.
