Place a 12-ounce tumbler in the freezer for about 30 minutes. Rub the rim of the tumbler with a cut lime, and dip it in the Lucas spice. Add the Clamato and seasonings. Squeeze the limes directly into the glass. Top up with the beer. Variations: Omit the Clamato and seasonings and add the juice of 1 more lime. Perfecta—add several plump, cooked shrimp to the glass. Drink the beer, eat the shrimp. Beer Diablito—substitute sangrita for the Clamato, add a dash of hot sauce. Beer Limonada—salt the rim of the glass; mix beer with an equal amount of Fresca or Squirt; top with a squeeze of lime.
