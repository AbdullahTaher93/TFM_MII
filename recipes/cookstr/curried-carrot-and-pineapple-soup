Melt the butter in a large saucepan or medium-size soup pot over moderate heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 8 to 9 minutes. Add the curry powder and ginger and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the carrots, potato, bay leaf, stock, and salt and bring the soup to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low, cover tightly, and simmer until the carrots are very tender, about 20 minutes. Using a large slotted spoon, transfer the soup solids to a food processor, adding a ladleful of the broth. Add the pineapple, then process the solids to a smooth puree. Stir the puree back into the soup. Reheat and taste the soup, adding more salt, if necessary, and pepper as needed. Serve piping hot.
