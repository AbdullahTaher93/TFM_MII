Melt the butter in a nonreactive small skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger, and cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the curry powder, shrimp, tomato, cilantro, and salt and pepper. Cook until the shrimp is done, about 1 minute. Correct the seasonings, adding salt or curry powder to taste.
