Bring 1Â¾ cups water and the sugar to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Stop stirring, increase the heat to high, and boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon zest and juice and let cool completely. Hull the strawberries and cut large ones in half. Combine the berries in a bowl and add the syrup. Stir gently to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate until chilled. Spoon into bowls and serve. Variation: Winter Salad: Use sliced apples and segmented oranges, instead of berries. For an exotic version, try papaya and mango, and use lime in the syrup. Winter Salad: Use sliced apples and segmented oranges, instead of berries.
