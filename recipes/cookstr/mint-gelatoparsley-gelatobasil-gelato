In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Blanch the herbs in the water for 45 seconds, take them out, and put them in a bowl of ice water. Drain the herbs. In a medium deep-sided bowl, add the drained herbs and 1 cup of the whole milk and puree using an immersion blender. Strain the puree through a chamois and set it aside. In a large bowl, prepare an ice bath. In a medium deep-sided bowl, using a rubber spatula, stir the egg yolks until they are a cohesive liquid. Do not use a whisk! Add the cream, condensed milk, milk powder, dextrose, sugar, honey, salt, herb puree, and remaining 1 cup whole milk, and combine using an immersion blender for about 1 minute. Set the bowl in the ice bath. Let the mixture cool, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. If you have time, place the mixture in an airtight container and refrigerate overnight. Spin the gelato in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Or use the dry-ice method in your stand mixer (see Notes).
