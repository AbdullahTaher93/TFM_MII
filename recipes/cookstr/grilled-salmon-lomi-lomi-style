Skin the salmon and, if you have bought one fillet, cut it into 2 pieces. Brush the tops with vegetable oil, sprinkle them with salt and pepper to taste, and place the salmon top down (the side you skinned up) on a very hot grill. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until brown and crusty. Remove the salmon from the grill. It should be well cooked on one side, but still raw on the other. Allow it to cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, combine all the other ingredients except the tomato in a large mixing bowl and mix well. When the salmon is cool, break it into bite-size pieces and add them to the lime juice mixture, cooked-side up. Stir lightly to make sure that all the pieces are well coated, then cover tightly and refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and add the chopped tomatoes. You can serve this chilled or at room temperature.
