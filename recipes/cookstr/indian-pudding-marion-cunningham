Preheat the oven to 275°F. Heat 2 cups of the milk until very hot and pour it slowly over the cornmeal, stirring constantly. Cook in a double boiler over simmering water for 10-15 minutes, until the cornmeal mixture is creamy. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Spoon into a buttered 1½-quart baking dish, pour the remaining 2 cups of milk on top, set into a pan of hot water, and bake for 2½-3 hours or until set. The pudding will become firmer as it cools.
