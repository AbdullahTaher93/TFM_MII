Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Remove any excess fat from the duck. Season inside and out with salt and pepper and squeeze the orange juice over the breast and legs. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Place the duck, breast-side up, in a baking pan large enough to hold it snugly (13 by 9 by 2 inches works well) and roast for 15 minutes. Drain off the rendered fat and turn the duck on its side. Roast 15 minutes, drain again, turn the duck onto its other side, and roast 10 minutes longer. Drain the fat, turn breast-side up, and roast 35 minutes. Remove from the pan and allow to rest 10 minutes before carving. To carve, with a sharp knife, cut off the 2 legs where they join the body (they should come off easily), Then cut down the length of the breastbone and carve the meat away from the bone, on the bias, into 5 or 6 slices.
