Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Beat the butter and sugar together in a medium bowl with an electric mixer set on high speed, about 2 minutes, or until light in color. Add the flour and salt and stir together with a wooden spoon to make a firm dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently until smooth. Roll the dough out to ¼ in (5mm) thickness. Using a 3in (7.5cm) fluted cookie cutter, cut out 10 rounds, re-rolling as necessary. Arrange the cookies spaced about ½ in (1cm) apart on a large baking sheet. Prick the tops with a fork. Bake about 20 minutes, or until lightly golden. Sprinkle the hot cookies with sugar and cool on the baking sheet. Variation: Chocolate Chip Shortbread Mix ½ cup semisweet or milk chocolate chips into the dough in Step 1 and proceed as Shortbread.
