To make the sauce, combine the broth, soy sauce, garlic, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and salt in a bowl and stir until well mixed. Pour the oil into a 2-quart saucepan and heat to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Carefully slip the green beans into the oil and cook, stirring continuously, until they are wrinkled, about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon or wire skimmer, transfer the beans to paper towels to drain. Reserve the oil. Heat a wok or stir-fry pan over high heat until hot. Add 2 tsp. of the reserved oil, swirling to coat the sides. Discard any remaining oil or strain and save for another use. Add the green beans and sauce and stir-try until the sauce boils. Add the cornstarch mixture and cook until the sauce thickens. Transfer to a serving plate and serve.
