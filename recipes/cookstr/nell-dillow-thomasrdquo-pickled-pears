In a bowl, toss the sliced pears with the lemon juice so they do not discolor. In a heavy non-aluminum kettle, combine the pears with the remaining ingredients and 1 cup of cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the pears for about 45 minutes, or until almost tender. Place the pears in sterilized jars, dividing the spices among the jars. Add syrup to reach Â½-inch from the top. Seal the jars at once.
