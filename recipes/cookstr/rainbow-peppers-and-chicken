Preheat the oven to 350°F. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and sauté the chicken pieces, in batches, until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Add up to 2 more tablespoons of oil as necessary. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Heat the remaining olive oil in a large flameproof casserole over medium-low heat. Add the onions and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until softened, 7 minutes. Add the garlic and wine and cook until the vegetables are very soft, about 3 minutes more. Add the tomatoes, basil, and sugar to the casserole and cook to soften the tomatoes and incorporate the sugar, 2 minutes. Return the chicken to the pot, smothering it in the sauce. Cover, transfer to the oven, and bake until the chicken is tender, 1¼ hours, basting occasionally. Serve with the Herbed Lemon Orzo. For the orzo: Bring the broth to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the orzo, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until just tender, 9 minutes. Drain, and return the pasta to the pan. Add the remaining ingredients and toss well to combine. Serve hot.
