Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar, vanilla, and nutmeg together in a saucepan until creamy-looking. Add the cream and 2 cups of the half-and-half, and whisk until blended. Cook over very low heat while stirring. Look for a temperature reading of 175 degrees on a meat thermometer. Don’t overheat or cook longer than needed to reach this temperature. Remove from the heat. Strain the egg nog into the container you will store it in and add the remaining half-and-half. Refrigerate. If you’d like to add something interesting (i.e., brandy, bourbon, or dark rum), a cup of the stuff should be about right. Serve with some more nutmeg (freshly grated, if possible) over the top.
