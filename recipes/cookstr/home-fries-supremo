Cut the potatoes lengthwise into quarters. Cut the quarters into 1-inch thick chunks, put them in a medium saucepan with just enough cold water to cover them. If using new potatoes, just cut them into quarters. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes. The potatoes should be slightly undercooked. Drain in a colander and set aside. When the potatoes are cooked and drained, put a large nonstick frying pan on high heat and let it get hot, about 30 seconds. Reduce the heat to medium high, add the oil, onion, and bell pepper, and cook until the onion is soft, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the potatoes. Cook for about 15 minutes, turning the potatoes frequently so that all sides get browned. Add the paprika and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 5 minutes more, until the potatoes are crisply browned.
