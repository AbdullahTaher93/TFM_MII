Place the berries in a shallow bowl and cover with the sugar. Set aside to form a syrup, about 1 hour. Once the syrup has formed, place a sieve over a medium-size bowl and pour the berries and syrup through, pressing with a wooden spoon to extract all the juice and syrup. Add the extract and the water and mix. Pour into a freezer container and freeze until a light frosting appears, about 2 hours. Spoon into small glasses, garnished with strawberry slices or whole raspberries.
