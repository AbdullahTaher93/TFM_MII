Place the cranberry sauce, mandarin oranges, and cinnamon in a food processor or blender and pulse until well combined, 30 seconds. Set the salsa aside. Make the blue cheese grits: Pour the chicken broth and milk into a 2-quart saucepan and heat over medium-high heat. When they come to a boil, stir in the grits, reduce the heat to low, and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until the grits thicken, 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the blue cheese and butter. Season with pepper to taste. Cover the pan and set aside. Make the chicken paillards: Place the chicken breast halves between 2 sheets of waxed paper on a work surface and pound them to a 1/3-inch thickness with a meat pounder or the bottom of a heavy skillet. Season on both sides with the salt. Place the oil and the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter has just melted, add the pounded chicken and cook until lightly browned, 2 minutes. Turn the chicken over and cook the second side for 1 minute. Add the wine, cover the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, and let the chicken simmer until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes longer. To serve, spoon the grits onto plates. Place a paillard next to the grits and garnish it with the salsa.
