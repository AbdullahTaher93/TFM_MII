Bring to a boil in a small saucepan about 1 cup water with ½ teaspoon salt. Add the shrimp and cook briefly until just opaque. Remove with a slotted spoon and measure the liquid to ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons (boil down if there is more). Transfer the liquid to a bowl and cool. Chop the shrimp with their shells into approximately 1/8-inch pieces. Add to the cooled liquid with the onion, garlic, parsley, paprika, flour, and salt to taste and stir until smooth. Let sit for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture should have the consistency of a thin pancake batter. Pour the oil to a depth of ¼ inch into a large skillet and heat to the smoking point. Drop the batter by the tablespoon into the oil, spreading and pricking with the edge of a spoon into thin, lacy-textured pancakes. Fry until golden, then flip them over to brown the other side. Drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a 200°F oven while preparing the rest of the pancakes. Transfer to a platter and serve.
