Preheat oven to 450°F, and set racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Grease or line 2 baking sheets. Combine the chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, spices, flour, baking powder, half of the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste in a food processor. Pulse until well combined but mixture is still relatively coarse. You do not want a puree. Using your hands or a small cookie scoop, shape the mixture into about 24 balls (roughly 1½ inches in diameter) and arrange on the prepared baking sheets. Flatten each slightly, and brush the tops with 1 tablespoon of the remaining olive oil. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, then turn patties (rotating the trays when you take them out) and baked for another 10-12 minutes. You may find it easiest to turn them using two forks. Toss the salad vegetables with the remaining lemon juice and olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Serve with hummus or other condiments, as sandwiches or as a platter.
