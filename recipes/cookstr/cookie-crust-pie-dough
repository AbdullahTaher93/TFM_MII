Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar in a medium bowl. Add the eggs and blend thoroughly. Add the flour and blend, gradually adding the water, until the dough forms walnut-sized balls. Shape the dough into a ball, wrap in waxed paper or plastic, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes before using. To prebake the pie crust: Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick. Place the dough in a pie pan, fitting it evenly over the bottom of the pan and pressing gently against the inside edges. Crimp the edges or trim away excess pie dough with a sharp knife. Cover the dough with a sheet of foil and weight down with aluminum baking weights or dried beans. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the weights and foil and continue to bake for 15 minutes, or until golden. Remove to a rack to cool.
