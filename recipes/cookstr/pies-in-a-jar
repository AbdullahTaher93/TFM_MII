TO PREPARE Wash and dry jars before using. Roll out pie dough slightly thinner than you would for a regular pie. Cut into pieces and press into jars three-fourths of the way up the sides of the jar. Spoon in pie filling until the jar is three-fourths full. Use a canning jar lid as a template for the diameter of the top crust. Make decorative cut-outs using tiny cookie cutters, if desired. Place the dough circles over jars, gently pressing dough in the center and on the sides. Add cut-out dough pieces. Sprinkle with sanding sugar if desired. Pies may be frozen with lids on for later use. FOR FRESH BAKING Place jars on baking sheet and bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Cover jars loosely with aluminum foil if the tops brown too quickly. You want to be sure the bottom crust bakes thoroughly. Allow jars to cool to the touch before serving. TO BAKE FROM FROZEN Place frozen jars on baking sheet. Remove lids. Bake at 350°F for 1 hour. Allow jars to cool to the touch before serving.
