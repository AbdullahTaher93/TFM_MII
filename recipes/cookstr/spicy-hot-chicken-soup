Place chicken in a large pot and add about 1 gallon of water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for at least 1 hour. Remove the chicken from the broth. Skim the fat from the chicken broth. Debone and de-skin the chicken. Then, shred the meat into thin strips. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the garlic, chili powder, soy sauce, salt, and 2 tablespoons chicken broth. Add the chicken and mix thoroughly. Cover and set aside for about 10 minutes allowing the chicken to season and the chili powder to soften. Combine the eggs and sesame oil in a small bowl and beat until well mixed. Bring the broth to a boil again. Add the seasoned meat, green onions, and black pepper. Bring to a boil again, then add the egg mix, drizzling it slowly over the boiling broth. Serve immediately with rice.
