Wash the callaloo or spinach and kale thoroughly by submerging in 2 to 3 different cold water baths. Lift the greens out first, then discard the water. Place the greens in a large soup pot (a Dutch oven is ideal) along with the pork, beef, okra, tomato, whole Scotch bonnet pepper and water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and partially cover. Simmer for 1Â½ hours. Remove the whole Scotch bonnet pepper. Take out the pork and beef from the pot and separate the meat from the bone and fat. Chop the meat and return it to the pot. Add the scallions, garlic, thyme, salt, black pepper, sliced Scotch bonnet pepper, chocho, yam and coconut milk. Cook for 30 minutes, adding water if needed for a proper soup consistency. To prepare the dumplings, in a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt. Add the water and blend with a wooden spoon until a ball is formed. Flour your hands and knead slightly to form a soft dough. Form it into flat round shapes (will make 8 to 10). Cook them in boiling water for 15 minutes. Serve the soup piping hot with a dumpling in each bowl.
