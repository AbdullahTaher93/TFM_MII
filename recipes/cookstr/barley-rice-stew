Creating the Jar: Wash and thoroughly dry a 1-pint wide-mouth canning jar. Layer the ingredients in the jar shown at left, pressing firmly with a flat-bottomed object, such as a tart tamper or the bottom of a narrow glass, after each addition. Make the layers as level as possible. Secure the lid, and decorate as desired (see Notes). Attach the following instructions for making the stew: BARLEY RICE STEW Pint-Jar Yield: 6 (1 cup) servings In addition to the contents of the jar, you will need to add the following ingredient: 7 cups water For quart jar, double the ingredient amount. Combine the water and contents of the Jar in a medium-sized pot, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, stir, and cower. Stirring occasionally, simmer for 1 hour, or until the barley is tender and the stew is thick. Serve hot. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
