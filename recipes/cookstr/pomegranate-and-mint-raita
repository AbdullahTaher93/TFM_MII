Seeding the pomegranate is the longest step in this recipe. First quarter the pomegranate, break each segment in half, and ruffle out the seeds gently, using your thumbs. That way the jewels stay intact. Once you've got your pomegranate seeds, put a frying pan on medium heat, tip the cumin seeds into the pan, and roast them for a couple of minutes. Then put them into a mortar and pestle and grind coarsely. Spoon the yogurt into a serving dish, add the cumin seeds, salt, sugar, fresh mint, and pomegranate seeds, and mix. If you want to make the dish look pretty, you can reserve a couple of mint leaves and pomegranate seeds until the end and scatter them over the top. Sprinkle the amchur on top and serve.
