In a bowl whisk the oil and vinegar, then add the capers, onion, piquillo pepper or pimiento, parsley, salt, and pepper. Scrub the mussels well, removing the beards. Discard any that do not close tightly. Place 1 cup water in a skillet with the lemon slice. Add the mussels and bring to a boil. Remove the mussels as they open; cool. Remove the mussel meat from the shells and mix them into the vinaigrette. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Reserve half the mussel shells, clean them well, and place them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Before serving, replace the mussels in their shells and spoon a small amount of the vinaigrette over each.
