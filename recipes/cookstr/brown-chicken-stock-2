Rinse the bones or chicken well and remove as much fat and skin as possible. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chicken and brown, turning, until golden brown. Be careful not to burn the bones (see Notes). Place the browned chicken into a stockpot and cover by about an inch with white chicken stock. Add the tomato paste and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1 hour, skimming whenever fat or scum accumulates on the surface. Add the onion, carrot, celery, leeks, and bay leaf and continue to cook for another 15 minutes. Add the parsley, thyme, and rosemary and cook for another 5 minutes. Strain. Return the stock to the pot and simmer over medium heat until reduced by half. Allow to cool, then refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 4 months.
