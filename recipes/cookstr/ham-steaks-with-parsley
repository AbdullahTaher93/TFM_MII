In a large-ish skillet, heat the garlic oil and when hot add the ham steaks and cook for about 3 minutes a side. Remove to two warmed dinner plates. Take the pan off the heat. Whisk the vinegar with the water, pepper, and honey and quickly throw into the still-hot pan along with most of the parsley. Swirl and stir and scrape to mix and pour over the ham steaks. Add the vegetable of your choice, in my unembarrassed one the ultragreen processed peas, and sprinkle the rest of the parsley over the two plates of food before tucking in.
