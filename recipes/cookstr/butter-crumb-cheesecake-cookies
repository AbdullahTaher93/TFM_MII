Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cream butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a bowl. Add flour and walnuts. Mix to make a crumb mixture. Reserve 1 cup for topping. Press remainder into bottom of an 8-inch-square pan sprayed lightly with cooking spray. Bake until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven; cool on cooling rack. Meanwhile, beat granulated sugar with cream cheese in a bowl until smooth. Add egg, lemon juice and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Spread mixture over cooled crust; sprinkle reserved crumb mixture over top. Bake, 25 minutes. Cool completely on rack before cutting into bars about 1Â¼ inch square.
