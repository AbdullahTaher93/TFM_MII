To make the dressing, shake the vinegar, oil, cilantro, fish sauce, chili sauce, and garlic in a jar. With a vegetable peeler, slice the cucumber lengthwise into ribbons, discarding the center core of seeds. Place in a bowl. 10 minutes before serving, pour the dressing over the cucumber and season with salt and pepper. Mound equal amounts of cucumber on individual plates, and arrange the smoked salmon strips on top. Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with lime wedges (if using).
