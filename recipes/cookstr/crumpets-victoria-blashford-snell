Whisk the bread and all-purpose flours and yeast together. Stir in the milk and ¾ tepid water. Cover and let stand in a warm place until the mixture has risen and begun to deflate. Dissolve the baking soda and salt in the remaining tepid water and whisk into the batter. Heat a large griddle over medium heat. Have ready four 4in (10cm) crumpet rings. Lightly oil the pan with oiled paper towels. Put the rings in the pan. Pour the batter into a glass measuring cup. Pour enough batter into each ring to come about ½–¾ in (1–2cm) up the sides. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until the batter has set all the way through and the top is covered in holes. If no bubbles appear the batter is too dry; stir a little water into the remaining batter. Lift the rings off the crumpets. Turn the crumpets and cook for about 3 minutes more, or until just golden. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve warm. (If desired, cool the crumpets, split and toast them.)
