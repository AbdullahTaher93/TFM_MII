Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Cut 2 lemons in half lengthwise, and then into thick slices. Combine the tomatoes, onion, lemon slices, paprika, honey, and bay leaves in a large ovenproof casserole with a lid. Season with the salt and cayenne. Cut the 2 remaining lemons into quarters. Insert 2 lemon quarters and 2 garlic cloves into the cavity of each poussin. Arrange the poussins on the tomato mixture and season with salt. Cover the casserole. Bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (180°C) for 15 minutes more, or until the juices run clear when pierced in the thigh with the tip of a knife. Transfer the poussins to a platter and keep warm. Skim the fat from the tomato mixture and discard the lemon slices and bay leaves. Purèe the tomato mixture and balsamic vinegar in a food processor. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve the poussins hot, with the sauce.
