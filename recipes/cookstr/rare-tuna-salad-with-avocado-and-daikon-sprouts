With a potato peeler, peel the carrot and daikon, then peel 20 thin carrot strips and 20 thin daikon strips. Place the strips in ice water and refrigerate. Arrange the tuna slices in a shallow, nonreactive pan or in a Ziploc bag. In a measuring cup, mix together the olive oil, lime juice, mustard, wasabi, and salt and pepper. Pour half of the mixture over the fish and reserve the rest. Cover the fish and refrigerate no more than 30 minutes or the marinade will begin to cook the fish like seviche. Remove the tuna and vegetables from the refrigerator. Place the tuna on an oiled grill and quickly grill over very hot coals, no more than 2 to 3 minutes, turning once, just until rare. Drain the carrot and daikon strips and pat dry with paper towels. Peel 20 thin strips of cucumber. Peel the avocado and cut in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 8 slices. Place a large handful of greens in the center of 4 individual plates. Cover with 3 slices of tuna. Arrange piles of carrot, daikon, and cucumber strips around the greens. Fan out 4 avocado slices on each plate and decorate with edible flowers and daikon sprouts. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the remaining marinade over the fish and greens. Sprinkle, with a twist of black pepper.
