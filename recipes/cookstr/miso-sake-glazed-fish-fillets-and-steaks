To make the glaze, combine all the ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over moderate heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Spread one third of the glaze over the bottom of a glass baking dish. Arrange the fish in the dish and spread the remaining glaze over the fillets or steaks to coat them completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, but no longer than 24 hours. Bring the fish to room temperature 30 minutes before cooking. To cook the fish, prepare a fire in a grill or preheat the broiler. Scrape the glaze from the fish and discard. Pat the fish dry with paper towels and brush lightly with the olive oil. Grill or broil 3 inches from the heat for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until you feel no resistance when you insert a kitchen fork into the fish. Serve immediately.
