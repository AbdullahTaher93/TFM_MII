Put the first 8 ingredients into a large bowl and mix well. Combine the dried plums and tea in a small bowl. Cover both bowls and let stand at least 12 hours. Drain the dried plums and discard the tea. Add the dried plums and grated apple to the soaked fruit, followed by the melted butter, brown sugar, eggs, and molasses, stirring well. Sift in the flour, spices, and baking powder. Add the bread crumbs and almonds. Mix well. Butter a 1½ quart heatproof bowl. Pour in the pudding batter. Cover with a double layer of parchment paper and 1 layer of aluminum foil, crimping the foil. Place on a steamer rack in a large pot of simmering water, with the water barely touching the bottom of the bowl. Cover and steam until dark and firm, for 8–10 hours, adding more boiling water to the pot as needed.
