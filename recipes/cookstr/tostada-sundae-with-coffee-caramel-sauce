Place 2 or 3 scoops of ice cream in the center of each tostada cup. Top with Coffee-Caramel Sauce. Eat right away. To Make the Tostada Cups Place ½ tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a frying pan large enough to hold a tortilla. Set over medium heat until the butter foams and the sugar melts. Stir. Add a tortilla to the pan and fry over medium to medium-high heat until the tortilla puffs up, about 1 minute. Turn and fry on the other side until well browned, about 1 minute more. Remove the tortilla to a small bowl, pressing down the center to fit the shape of the bowl. Let cool until set, then remove the tostada cup from the bowl. Add more butter and sugar to the pan and continue with another round until all the tortillas are fried and formed. Makes 6 tostada cups To Make the Coffee-Caramel Sauce Place all of the ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boll. Reduce the heat and simmer to just before the soft ball stage (about 230°F on a candy thermometer), about 15 minutes. Serve right away, or cover, refrigerate, and use within several months. Makes 1½ cups Takes less than 20 minutes
