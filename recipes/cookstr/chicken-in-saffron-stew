Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a heavy-bottomed flameproof casserole dish over medium-high heat. Add the pine nuts and bread and fry for 3 minutes, or until golden. Remove and drain on paper towel. When cooled slightly, put in a mortar and pestle or food processor, add the cinnamon, saffron, garlic, and half the parsley, and grind or process to a coarse, crumbly consistency. Heat the remaining oil in the casserole dish over medium heat and brown the chicken pieces for about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add the onion and cook gently for 5 minutes, or until translucent. Return the chicken pieces to the casserole dish with the wine, stock, bay leaf, and thyme and simmer, covered, over low-medium heat for 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender. Remove the chicken and cover to keep warm. Add the pine nut and bread mixture to the dish and cook for 2 minutes, or until thickened slightly. Remove from the heat and whisk in the lemon juice, egg yolks, and remaining parsley. Return the casserole dish to the stovetop and stir over very low heat until just thickened slightly again (do not allow it to boil or the sauce will separate). Season to taste, return the chicken to the casserole and gently warm through before serving.
