In a large bowl, combine oranges, lime, grapefruit, jicama and 1 tsp (5 mL) of the hot pepper flakes. Gently add mango and toss. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or for up to 2 hours. Taste for heat levels and add remaining pepper flakes before serving, if desired.
