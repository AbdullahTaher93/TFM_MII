In a non-aluminum saucepan, combine the berries or grapes with the sugar, lemon slices, and lemon juice. Warm the berries over moderate heat, gently tossing to coat with the sugar. Cover tightly and cook until the sugar has melted and the berries begin to give off their juice. Remove from the heat and serve immediately with the birds.
