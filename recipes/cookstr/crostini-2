Oven method: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Place as many of the bread slices as will fit in a single layer on a large (not air-cushioned) cookie sheet. Brush the tops with a generous amount of butter or olive oil. Toast for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the bread is brown around the edges and crisp. Let cool. Repeat with any remaining bread. Stovetop method: Pour enough melted butter or oil into a large frying pan to lightly coat the bottom. Heat over medium heat. Add as many slices of bread as will fit in a single layer and cook over medium heat until golden brown on the first side. Turn the slices over. Cook until golden brown on the other side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining slices, adding butter or olive oil to the pan as needed. VARIATION: Garlic Croutons Mash 1 clove garlic into the melted butter or olive oil. Follow the oven method.
