Sprinkle 2½ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper all over each chicken, including the cavity. Place a rack in a pan, put the chicken on top, and let sit for up to 24 hours, uncovered, in the refrigerator. (If you’ve brined the chicken, skip this step. Just sprinkle the bird with ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper and proceed with the rest of the recipe.) Preheat the oven to 425°F. Set an oven rack to the middle position. Mix the mustard, oil, rosemary, and brown sugar together in a small bowl and brush all over the chicken and inside the cavity. Toss the onion with the vinegar and ½ teaspoon salt in a large roasting pan. Set a rack in the pan and the chicken breast side up on the rack. Roast the chicken until the breasts are nicely browned all over, about 35 minutes. Gently flip the chicken (I like using tongs to clutch the inside of the cavity and the side of the bird) and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165°F to 170°F—this should take another 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, breast side up. Meanwhile, return the pan to the oven to finish browning the onions for 10 minutes. Carve the chicken, drizzle with any juices accumulated on the cutting board, and serve with the onions.
