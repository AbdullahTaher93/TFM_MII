Finely chop the onions. Peel and cut each carrot into 3 pieces. Rinse and stem the mushrooms. Thinly slice the caps (reserve the stems for soup). Peel the garlic cloves but leave them whole. Heat the oil in your pressure cooker over high heat until very hot. Add the veal roast and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. With tongs, remove the veal to a plate. Add the onions to the pressure cooker and saut√© over medium heat until they just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes. Add the carrots, mushrooms, garlic, spaghetti sauce, water, and 1 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Return the browned veal to the pot and bring the liquid to a boil over high heat. Cover the pressure cooker, lock the lid, and slowly bring to full pressure. Cook at full pressure for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pressure return to normal, at room temperature (this takes about 15 minutes). Release the pressure and unlock the cooker, averting your face as you do so to prevent a steam burn. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Slice the meat. Variation If you have the time, you can remove the roast and other solids and boil the liquid over high heat until reduced to a thick pan sauce.
