Put the chicken in the slow cooker. (If the meat was frozen, make sure it is thoroughly defrosted. Never use frozen foods in a slow cooker, because it takes too long to raise the heat to an appropriate level for safe, bacteria-free cooking.) In a food processor, grind the onion, tomato, ginger, and garlic until smooth. This may take a few minutes, so be patient. You want the paste to be as smooth as possible. Transfer the paste to a bowl. Whisk in the salt, turmeric, garam masala, oil, yogurt, red chile powder, and methi. Pour this mixture over the chicken. Add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, and green chiles. Mix gently. Cook on low for 8 hours. If you want more both with your chicken add the water toward the end of the cooking time. Remove the whole spices. Garnish with cilantro and serve over bed of basmati or brown rice or with roti or naan. Try This! For you vegetarians out there, substitute seitan for the chicken and follow the same steps. Although seitan does not need to cook as long as the chicken would, stick to the cooking time given. The masala still needs to cook thoroughly. If you are concerned that the seitan may get tough, add it in after four hours of cooking.
