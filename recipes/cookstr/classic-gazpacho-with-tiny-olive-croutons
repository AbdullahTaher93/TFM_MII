Place the bread in a bowl, add cold water to cover, and let soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the bread and squeeze out the excess liquid. Place the garlic, cumin, and ½ teaspoon salt in a mortar and, using a pestle, mash them to a paste. Place the tomatoes, cucumbers, Italian and red peppers, onion, soaked bread, and the garlic pate in a large bowl and toss to mix. Let stand for about 15minutes. Working in two batches, place the vegetable mixture in a food processor and process until smooth, adding half of the olive oil to each batch. Once each batch is finished, puree it finely in a blender, then transfer it to a large mixing bowl. When all the gazpacho has been pureed, whisk in the spring water and vinegar. It should have the consistency of a smoothie. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and/or vinegar as necessary. Refrigerate the gazpacho, covered, until chilled, about 2 hours. Serve the soup in glass bowls or wineglasses with the garnishes. For fried croutons: Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat until a bread cube dropped in the oil sizzles on contact. Add the bread and cook, stirring, until crunchy and golden brown, 1 to 1½ minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the croutons to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. For baked croutons: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Toss the bread cubes with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or melted butter. Spread the bread cubes out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.
