Preheat the oven to 275°F. Score the vanilla beans lengthways and run a knife up the beans to remove the vanilla seeds. Scrape the seeds into a pan with the beans, cream and milk and then slowly bring to the boil. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, beat together the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Remove the vanilla beans from the pan and little by little add the milk and cream to the egg mixture, whisking continuously. For a more intense flavor add a small handful of lavender flowers, but the trick is to be delicate – you only need a hint of the flavor. Remove any bubbles or froth from the mixture before dividing it between 4 little shallow serving dishes. Stand these in a suitable-sized roasting pan filled with water halfway up the containers. Bake for around 25 minutes or until the custard has set but is still slightly wobbly in the center. Allow to cool at room temperature then place in the fridge until ready. To serve, sprinkle each creme brulee with 1 tablespoon of sugar and some more of the lavender flowers and caramelize under a very hot broiler or using a kitchen blow torch.
