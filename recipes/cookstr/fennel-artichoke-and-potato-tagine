In the bottom of a flameproof tagine, heat oil over medium heat. Add red onions, garlic, ginger and spice blend and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add sweet potato, fennel and artichokes. Cover with tagine lid, reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Toss vegetables with feta cheese. Garnish with sesame seeds.
