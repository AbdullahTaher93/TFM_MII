In a 5-quart pot, combine the clams and 6 cups of cold water. Cover and place over high heat. When the water begins to boil, uncover the pot and boil the clams until they open, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the clams from their shells. Set aside in a large bowl. Strain the broth through a sieve lined with a few layers of cheesecloth or a tightly woven cloth napkin. Leave behind any sand that may have settled in the pot. You should have slightly less than 8 cups of liquid. Set aside. Rinse out the 5-quart pot and dry it. Put the bacon or salt pork in the pot and cook over medium-low heat until some of the fat has rendered and the meat has lost its raw color. Add the diced onion, carrot, celery, and green pepper. Toss well, then cook over medium heat until the vegetables are well wilted, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the potatoes and the reserved and strained clam broth. Bring to a boil, then adjust heat so broth just simmers. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes, the thyme, and the bay leaf. Continue to simmer another 30 minutes or so, until the vegetables are very tender. Meanwhile, push the clams through the medium blade of a meat grinder, or finely chop them in a food processor. When the chowder has cooked for half an hour, add the clams, then shut off the heat. Add freshly ground pepper to taste. Correct the saltâ€”the chowder may not need any because clams are salty, and the tomatoes have salt, but usually it does. The chowder is much better when it is allowed to stand for several hours, or refrigerated overnight, then gently reheated just to the simmering point. Serve very hot.
