Brush steaks thoroughly with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place medallions on preheated grill, close lid and grill, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer registers 145°F (63°C) for medium rare, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate, tent with foil and let stand for 10 minutes. Preheat broiler with rack 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) away from heat. Place steaks on individual ovenproof plates. Top each steak with equal amounts of chile and cheese. Broil until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
