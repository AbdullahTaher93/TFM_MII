TO MAKE THE GREEN GODDESS DRESSING: In a blender or food processor, combine the egg yolks, vinegar, and mustard. With the motor still running, slowly drizzle in the oil in a stream, emulsifying the dressing. Add the chives, dill, and tarragon to the mixture and blend or process until the herbs are minced. Season with the salt. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend. TO MAKE THE SALAD: Preheat the grill to medium-high (350°F to 400°F). In a medium bowl, coat the asparagus and green onions evenly with the oil. Place the asparagus and green onions on the grill and cook, turning frequently, about 2 minutes for the onions and 3 to 4 minutes for the asparagus, until crisp-tender. Remove from the grill. Sprinkle lightly with the salt and set aside to cool to room temperature. Once the asparagus and green onions have cooled, slice them on the bias into 1- to 2-inch lengths. In a large serving bowl, combine the frisée, mizuna, bacon, asparagus, and onions. Add ¼ cup of the Green Goddess Dressing and toss well; add more dressing if the salad seems dry. (The remaining dressing can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.) Arrange the salad on serving plates, top with the hard-boiled eggs, and season with the black pepper.
