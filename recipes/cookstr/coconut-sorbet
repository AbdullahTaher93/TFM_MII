Heat the water and sugar in a saucepan, stirring until all the sugar is dissolved. If you are using solid cream of coconut, break it into smaller pieces and add to the syrup, stirring until dissolved. (If you are using liquid cream of coconut, remember to stir the contents of the can before measuring because it usually separates while sitting on the shelf.) Cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until chilled. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s directions. The mixture will be slushy. Pour into a container with a tight-fitting lid and freeze at least 3 hours or until firm. Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before serving.
