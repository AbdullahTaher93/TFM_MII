Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it is very hot, add the curry powder. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the onion, scallion, garlic, sweet pepper, Scotch bonnet pepper and black pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Add the tomato sauce or paste and cook 3 minutes more. Add the water and blend well. Add the okra and shrimp. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook until the shrimp are just cooked through, about 5 minutes. It is best served hot, straight out of the pan.
