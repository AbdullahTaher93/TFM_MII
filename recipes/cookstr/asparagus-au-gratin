Preheat the oven to 400Â°F and prepare a steamer. Trim the asparagus and add them to the steamer basket. Cook for 2 minutes covered. Transfer the asparagus to a greased baking sheet. In a bowl, mix together the cheese, breadcrumbs, oil, mustard, parsley, and season to taste. Spread over the asparagus and bake for 10 minutes or until the mixture is golden brown.
