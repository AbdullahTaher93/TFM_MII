Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. When the water starts to boil, add the pasta and cook the ramen noodles according to the package, directions, or the vermicelli until al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse under cold water until cool. Shake the colander well to release as much water as possible, then add the vegetable oil to the noodles and toss gently. While the water is corning to a boil and the pasta is cooking, peel the cucumber and cut it in half lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds with the tip of a spoon and cut the cucumber into Â½-inch slices. Put the slices in a medium bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use. Blend the peanut butter, soy sauce, white wine, lemon juice, honey, garlic, and ginger in a blender on medium speed or in a food processor, until completely smooth. Set the mixture aside. Transfer the noodles to a serving platter. Pour on the peanut sauce and toss gently. Garnish with the cucumber slices and chopped scallion. Serve immediately.
