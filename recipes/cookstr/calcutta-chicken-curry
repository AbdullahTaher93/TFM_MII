Mix the salt, pepper, and flour together in a bowl and add the chicken pieces to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat in a large Dutch oven. Add the chicken in two batches, sauteing each batch until lightly browned; remove the chicken to a plate. Add the remaining butter and oil to the warm pot, and add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook uncovered for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the curry powder and turmeric and cook for 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, chicken broth, and tomatoes and stir. Turn the heat down, partially cover the pot, and cook for 20 minutes. Remove the lid and gently cook for 10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly. Serve with steamed rice and garnishes.
