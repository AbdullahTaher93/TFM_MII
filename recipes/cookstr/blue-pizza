Place a baking stone in the oven, and preheat to 500°F (260°C) or higher for 1 hour. Warm the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the red onion slices, and cook for about 2 minutes. The onion slices should be soft but not browned. Stretch the pizza dough to a diameter of 12 inches (30 cm). Tear the mozzarella, and distribute over the dough, leaving a 1-inch (3-cm) wide border. Distribute the Onion Jam over the pizza. Spread the Gorgonzola over the pizza. Spread the Parmigiano-Reggiano over the pizza, and drizzle olive oil over the pizza. Distribute the pecans and red onion slices over the pizza. Bake the pizza on the baking stone until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling. Remove the pizza from the oven, place it on a plate, and serve.
