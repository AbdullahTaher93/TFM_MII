Preheat a barbecue grill to high. While the grill is heating, place the scallops in a bowl and add the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and the salt and pepper. Toss, and let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature. While the scallops are marinating, cut the skin and the white pith off the grapefruit and oranges. Using a small sharp knife, cut out the segments, holding the fruit over a bowl to catch the juices. Place the segments in a second bowl. Squeeze the membranes over the juice bowl to extract any extra juice. Season the juice with salt and pepper to taste, and then whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Set both bowls aside. Thread 3 scallops on each of four skewers, leaving a little space between them for even cooking. Oil the grill grate well and arrange the skewers on the grate. Grill until the scallops are just cooked through, 2 minutes per side. Divide the watercress among four large salad plates. Drizzle it lightly with the citrus dressing, and then arrange the grapefruit and orange segments on top. Place 3 grilled scallops in the center of each plate. Garnish with the parsley, and serve.
