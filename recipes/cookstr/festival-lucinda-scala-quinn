In a large bowl, mix together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, baking powder and allspice. In another bowl, combine the vanilla and milk. Slowly stir the milk mixture into the flour mixture to achieve a thick batter. Turn the batter onto a floured surface, knead the dough lightly and form it into a log shape. Divide it into 8 pieces. With floured hands, roll each piece into a 4-inch-long sausage shape. Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over high heat until it is very hot. Fry the dough, turning each piece until golden brown all over, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels before serving.
