Carefully separate and devein the liver (see Notes) and salt and pepper it generously on both sides. Before reforming each lobe, spread 1 tablespoon of preserved shallots over the inner surface and close the meat around it. Line the terrine with plastic wrap, letting 10 inches hang over the sides. Spread the remaining shallots over the bottom of the terrine. Lay the large lobe of the liver on top of the shallots, smooth side down, then set the smaller lobe on top of it, smooth side up, and press the liver firmly into the terrine. Wrap it well in the plastic wrap, being sure all the surfaces are covered. Preheat the oven to 200°F. Line a roasting pan with a double layer of paper towels and place the terrine in the pan. Add boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the terrine and put the roasting pan in the oven. Using an instant-read thermometer, check the temperature of the liver after 45 minutes, and continue to bake until the internal temperature reaches 175°F, 10 or 15 minutes more. Remove the terrine from the water bath, let it cool, and refrigerate for at least 3 days before serving. The foie gras will keep up to 2 weeks. Remove the foie gras from the terrine and scrape off any membranes and all the fat. Using a thin slicing knife dipped in hot water and dried, slice the foie gras ¼ inch thick. Place two slices on each plate and serve with toast.
