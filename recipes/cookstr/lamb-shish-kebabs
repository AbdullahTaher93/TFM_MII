In a shallow glass, ceramic, or other nonreactive dish, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, onion, curry powder, salt, coriander seeds, ginger, and garlic. Add the lamb, toss to coat, and cover. Alternatively, mix the marinade in a sturdy plastic bag, add the cubes, seal, and gently turn the bag to coat the meat. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours, stirring or turning occasionally. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill until the coals or heating elements are medium hot or preheat the broiler. Lift the lamb from the marinade and let any excess marinade drip back into the dish. Thread the lamb onto 6 metal skewers, alternating with the onions, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and zucchini. Lay the skewers on the grill or under the broiler about 4 inches from the heat. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat or longer for more well-done meat and until the vegetables soften. Move the skewers to cooler or hotter parts of the grill during cooking to avoid burning. Baste once with the marinade in the first minutes of grilling or broiling. Serve immediately, a skewer per serving.
