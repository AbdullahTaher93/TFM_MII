Preheat the oven to 400°F and lightly spray a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. In the bowl of an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat the butter for 2 minutes until it is soft and pale yellow. Beat in the brown sugar gradually. Measure the flour, salt, and baking soda into a sifter, and sift it into the butter mixture. Beat for a minute. Beat or stir in the oats. Measure out 1 cup of the dough and set aside. Carefully press the rest of the dough into the pan, pushing with your fingers to flatten it out to the edges of the pan. Spread the jam evenly over the crust, leaving a ¼-inch margin around the edges. Evenly scatter the reserved dough over the jam. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, just until the crust is light brown. Cool the cookies in the pan set on a wire rack. When they are cool, cut off and discard about ½ inch from each side of the pan. Cut the rest of the pan into 24 bars. Store for up to 3 days in an airtight container or freeze for up to 1 month.
