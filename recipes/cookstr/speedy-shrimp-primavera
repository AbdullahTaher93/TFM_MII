Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a sauté pan, then add the garlic and cook and stir for a minute or two. Add the shrimp and cook until the pink color disappears. Add the wine, jalapeno, and about ½ cup hot water from the pasta pot. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Two minutes before the pasta is supposed to be done, add the broccoli to the pasta pot to cook. When the pasta and broccoli are done, add the broccoli to the pasta pot to cook. When the pasta and broccoli are done, drain, and return them to the pot. Stir in the shrimp sauce and serve on warmed plates. Garnish with the chile flakes. If using previously cooked pasta, use hote water—it does not have to be from the pasta pot. Then, add the broccoli and cook with the shrimp. If you prefer the broccoli to be cooked more, microwave for three minutes.
