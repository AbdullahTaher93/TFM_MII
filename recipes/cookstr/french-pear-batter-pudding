1.5 liter/1 1/4 quart/1 1/2 quart baking dish Heat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/Gas 5. Butter the baking dish, sprinkle it with sugar, and turn the dish so it is evenly coated, discarding excess sugar. Peel, core and slice the pears in crescents. Sprinkle the slices with the lemon juice so they don't discolor and spread them in the baking dish. Make the batter: Put the sugar in a bowl, add the eggs and whisk for 1-2 minutes until light and frothy. Stir in the flour and salt just until smooth. Don't beat the batter at this stage as this will make the pudding tough. Stir in the milk, and strain the batter over the pears to remove any lumps of flour. Bake the pudding for 55-65 minutes until it is puffed and brown. It should be firm in the center and will have started to pull away from the sides of the dish. Let it cool for 5-10 minutes, then sprinkle with the alcohol. (The aroma from the hot alcohol is a treat in itself.) Dust it generously with confectioners' sugar and serve warm.
