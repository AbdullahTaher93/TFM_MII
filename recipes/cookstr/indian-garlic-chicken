With a sharp knife, make a few shallow slashes in the chicken flesh and place in a nonmetallic dish. To make the marinade, mix all the ingredients in a small bowl. Pour over the chicken, and toss until well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a deep roasting pan with foil. Arrange the chicken in the pan. Pour about 2/3 cup water into the pan to form a shallow layer. Spoon any remaining marinade over the chicken. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the chicken pieces are golden and crisp show no sign of pink when pierced at the bone. Serve hot or cold.
