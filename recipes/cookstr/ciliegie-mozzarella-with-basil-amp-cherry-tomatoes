Spear one half of one cherry tomato on a toothpick. Next, spear two halves of a fresh basil leaf, followed by one half of a mozzarella ball. Repeat for all 12 hors dâ€™oeuvres, and season with salt and pepper. Arrange on a tray and serve with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil (I like to offer them separately) on the side for dipping. Add the minced garlic to the olive oil for an extra layer of flavor.
