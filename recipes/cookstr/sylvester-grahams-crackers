In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, sugars, and honey until smooth. In a medium bowl, combine the flours, salt, and cinnamon. Add the dry ingredients to the mixer bowl and beat until the dough just comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and pat it into a disk. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets or line them with parchment paper. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and roll it into a 12-inch square. Use a knife to cut the dough into 2-inch squares. Carefully transfer the squares to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them evenly apart, and prick them all over with a fork. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
