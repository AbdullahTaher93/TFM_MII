Make the vinaigrette. In a medium bowl, whisk the vinegar and mustard together with ¼ teaspoon salt and a few generous grinds black pepper. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, whisking so it thickens and forms an emulsion. In a large bowl, gently toss together the frisée, sliced apple, blue cheese, walnuts, and tarragon. Toss this with half the vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper to taste. Top with the chicken, drizzle with the remaining vinaigrette, and serve.
