Heat the bacon in an ovenproof casserole over low heat until its fat is released and the bacon begins to brown. Add the onion and saute, stirring constantly, until the onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Stir in the chutney, vinegar, water, mustard, and salt. Bring to a boil, stir in the beans, return to a boil, cover, and bake 20 to 30 minutes or until they are bubbly and the top is crisp.
