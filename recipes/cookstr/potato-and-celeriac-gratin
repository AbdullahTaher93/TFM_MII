Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the potatoes and the celeriac in a large saucepan and cover with the milk and cold water. Add the garlic, salt, bay leaves, and bunch of thyme. Bring to a simmer over medium, high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the vegetables from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring from time to time, until the vegetables are tender but not falling apart, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half of the vegetables to the gratin dish. Discard the milk and water mixture and the thyme. Season to taste with nutmeg and pepper, and cover with half of the cream and half of the cheese. Cover with a final layer of vegetables, cream, and cheese. Season again with nutmeg and pepper. Sprinkle with the thyme leaves. Place in the center of the oven and bake until crisp and golden on top, 1 to 1Â½ hours. Serve immediately.
