Heat the butter in a large skillet or sauté pan. Add the carrots and leek; sauté, stirring, over low heat 5 minutes. Add the zucchini and asparagus; sauté, stirring, 3 minutes. Add the cream; heat to boiling; boil until reduced and slightly thickened, about 8 minutes. Stir in the scallions, lemon juice, and salt. Meanwhile, cook the rotelle in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, or firm to the bite, about It minutes; drain. Add pasta and mozzarella to the sauce in the sauté pan; toss to blend. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese to taste on top of each serving.
