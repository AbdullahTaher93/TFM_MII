Heat the oil in a stockpot over high heat. Add all the vegetables except the garlic and parsley, and saut√© them for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the garlic, parsley, peppercorns, bay leaves, and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, and turn down the heat. Simmer for 35 minutes. Add the wine, and simmer for another 10 minutes. Strain out the vegetables, and let the broth cool. It will keep in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for 1 week. The stock also freezes well; just be sure to leave room in the container for expansion.
