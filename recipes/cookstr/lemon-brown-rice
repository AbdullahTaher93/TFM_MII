Soak the split gram in boiled water while you prep the remaining ingredients. In a bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, turmeric, salt, and chutney powder. Set aside. In a deep, heavy pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the asafetida, dried red chiles, and curry leaves. Cook, stirring constantly, until the leaves curl slightly, about 1 minute. Add the mustard and coriander seeds. Cook until they pop, about another minute. Add the drained split gram. Cook for about 1 minute, until the lentils are lightly toasted. Add the lemon juice mixture, green chiles, ginger root, and water. Heat to a gentle simmer, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the rice slowly and mix well. Add the peanuts and cilantro. Serve as a one-pot meal with a side of coconut chutney or soy yogurt raita.
