Heat the olive oil in a 6-quart pot over medium heat. Add the leek and peppers and cook, partially covered, until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken stock and 2 cups water and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and puree with an immersion blender. Return the soup to the heat, add the lentils, and cook for another 25 minutes, until the lentils are soft and broken down. Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste.
