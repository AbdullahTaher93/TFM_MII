Brisket Place the brisket and its accompanying vegetables and herbs in a pan and cover with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then straightaway reduce to a very gentle simmer, skimming constantly. This should take about 2½ hours to cook, but always check with a knife how giving the meat is. Allow the beef to cool in the broth. Chicken Place the chicken in a pan with its team of vegetables and herbs, bring to a boil, then place a lid on the pan and remove from the heat. Allow to cool in the stock. This will make for a moist chicken, necessary as it is to be cooked again. Remove the beef and chicken from their stocks and cut into pieces, not too small but just so it’s possible to eat them with a spoon. Strain both stocks, then add the beef stock to the chicken stock to taste. Remember, the beef stock will be quite salty, so be cautious—it may not take much. (A slight salt undertone is a good thing, though, as it plays very well with the sweet prunes we shall add at the end.) Finishing Now, in a pan large enough to construct your soup, sweat your sliced leeks in the duck fat or olive oil for about 8 minutes, so as to bring out their sweet leeky nature, but not to lose their crunch. Pour in the stock. Add the chopped chicken and beef, bring to a gentle simmer, and let the meat heat through thoroughly. Three minutes before serving add the prunes, just giving them time to puff up. Don’t pit the prunes. Serve in big bowls with much bread at hand. Warn your guests about the pits.
