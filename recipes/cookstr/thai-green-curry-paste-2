In a small skillet, toast the coriander and cumin seeds over medium heat for about 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind into a fine powder. In a food processor, combine the ground spices with the remaining ingredients and process for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture becomes a smooth, thick paste. Occasionally stop to scrape down the sides of the processor bowl. If needed, add a tablespoon or two of water to get the mixture moving. Store the paste in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week.
