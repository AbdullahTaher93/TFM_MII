Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes with their juices, clam juices, wine, and tomato paste. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover the pan and simmer for 10–15 minutes, until the sauce thickens, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Stir in the linguine, and cook according to the package directions, or until al dente. Drain the pasta, and shake to remove any excess water. When the pasta is almost done, add the clams and chopped parsley to the tomato sauce and continue to simmer for 1–2 minutes, until heated through. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the linguine to the sauce, and toss to combine all the ingredients, so the clams are well distributed throughout the pasta. Sprinkle with extra parsley and serve at once. 2.
