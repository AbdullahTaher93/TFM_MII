Put the bacon pieces in a pan just large enough to hold the chicken. Sauté the bacon until well browned and the fat has oozed out. Move the bacon to a small bowl, leaving the fat in the pan. Put the chicken pieces in the pan and sauté over medium heat, turning the pieces over from time to time, until lightly browned on all sides. Move to a bowl. Add the mushrooms to the pan and cook, stirring, until browned. Place in a bowl. Add the onions to the pan and cook until lightly browned. Move to the mushroom bowl. Stir the tomato paste and wine into the pan. The sauce can be made ahead up to this point. About 30 minutes before serving, add the chicken and bay leaf to the pan. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Stick a knife into the thick part of the chicken to make sure it is done; the juices should run clear. Add the onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook until the vegetables are warm. Stir in the parsley and thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the bacon.
