Whisk together the egg yolks and water in a large bowl, then whisk in the mix and the oils just until well combined. Heat up your waffle iron. Using clean beaters and a high-sided bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff, then gently fold them into the batter. When the iron is good and hot and ready to waffle, pour in the batter, following your waffle maker’s directions. Let the waffles bake in the griddle until done, 4 to 6 minutes. How can you tell when they’re done? Less steam is emitted from the waffle iron and they will smell done. Some waffle irons have an indicator light, gauge, or even a beeper that tips you off. Serve, hot from the waffle iron, with any or all of the accompaniments, if you like.
