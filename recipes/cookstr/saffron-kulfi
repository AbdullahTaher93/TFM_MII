In a small bowl, soak the saffron threads in 1 tbsp boiling water for 2 minutes. Chop the pistachios roughly, and reserve a few to scatter on the top. Finely chop the remaining pistachios. Mix the condensed milk and finely chopped pistachios together in a bowl. Stir in the saffron and its liquid. Whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Fold it into the saffron mixture until well combined. Fill the ice cube trays with the mixture. Freeze at least 4 hours, until completely set. When frozen, place the ice cube trays into zippered freezer bags and freeze until ready to serve. To serve, unmold the kulfi out of the ice cube trays onto chilled plates. Sprinkle with the reserved pistachios and serve immediately.
