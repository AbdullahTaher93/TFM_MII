Creating the Jar: Wash and thoroughly dry a 1-pint wide-mouth canning jar. Layer the ingredients in the jar, pressing firmly with a flat-bottomed object, such as a tart tamper or the bottom of a narrow glass, after each addition. Make the layers as level as possible. For best results, when adding the flour, add a little at a time, firmly tamping after each addition. Secure the lid and decorate as desired (see Notes). Attach the instructions for making the cookies found below.
