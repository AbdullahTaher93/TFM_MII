Quarter and core the cabbage and cut it into roughly 2-inch squares. Put in a large stainless-steel bowl with the daikon and scallions and set aside. In another large bowl or a half-gallon jar, combine the salt with 8 cups water, stirring to dissolve the salt. Pour the brine over the vegetables to just cover them, then put a plate on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Cover the container with a clean, heavy towel and let sit at room temperature for 8 hours, or overnight. Drain the vegetables, reserving the brine, and return them to the bowl. In a small bowl, combine the chile powder, ginger, garlic, and anchovies, mashing with a fork to make a loose paste. Add the paste and the scallions to the cabbage and daikon and toss to coat thoroughly. Pack the mixture tightly into a half-gallon glass jar. Pour in some of the reserved brine if necessary, pressing down on the vegetables to make sure they're just covered with brine. Stuff a resealable plastic bag into the mouth of the jar, pour in enough of the remaining brine to keep the vegetables submerged in the brine, and seal the bag. Let ferment at cool room temperature for about 1 week, until slightly sour and very tasty, then remove the bag and put a lid on the jar. Refrigerate and use as desired. The kimchi will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks, becoming gradually more sour.
