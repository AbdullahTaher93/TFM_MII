Mix the warm water and honey in the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer. Sprinkle in the yeast and let stand until the mixture looks foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the cool water, the oil, basil, oregano, granulated garlic, and salt. Attach the bowl to the mixer and fit with the paddle blade. Mix on low speed to dissolve the salt. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Change to the dough hook. Knead on medium speed until the dough is smooth, supple, and slightly sticky, about 5 minutes. Gather the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly oiled medium bowl, and turn to coat. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1¼ hours. Position the racks in the top third and center of the oven and preheat the oven to 450°F. Sprinkle two large baking sheets with cornmeal. Punch down the dough. Sprinkle a work surface with cornmeal, and pat and stretch out the dough into a 12 × 9-inch rectangle. Brush the top of the dough with water and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Using a pizza wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough lengthwise into ½-inch-wide strips. Place the strips (they will stretch) about ½ inch apart on the baking sheets. Immediately place in the oven and bake, switching the position of the racks from top to bottom after 6 minutes, until the breadsticks are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool completely. (The breadsticks can be wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at room temperature for up to 1 day.)
