In a large casserole or Dutch oven, heat the peanut oil over medium-high heat. Cook the onions until translucent, stirring, about 5 minutes. Add the beef and, once it turns color, add the tomato paste, water, cayenne, salt and black pepper, and thyme. Reduce the heat to low, covet, and cook for 1 hour. Add the cabbage, potato, turnips, and sweet potato. Cover and cook until tender, 2 to 2½ hours. Remove about ½ cup of the liquid from the casserole and stir into the peanut butter in a small bowl. Pour this sauce over the meat and cook for 5 minutes. Serve over plain rice.
