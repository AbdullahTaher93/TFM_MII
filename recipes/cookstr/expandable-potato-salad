Microwave the potatoes on high in their skins until done but still firm. Allow 2 to 3 minutes per potato, test for doneness, then add a little more time as needed. When cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes and cut into ½ - to ¾-inch chunks. Place them in a serving container. Combine the mayonnaise and mustard in a small bowl and stir together. Add to the potatoes, along with the celery and peas; mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Add any of the optional ingredients you’d like; mix well. Cover and refrigerate until needed or serve at once.
