Preheat the oven to 400Â°F and fill a muffin tin with paper cups. Measure out the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Pour all the liquid ingredients into a measuring cup. Mix both together, remembering that a lumpy batter makes the best muffins (although my children always over-mix as they argue over whose turn it is to stir next) then spoon into the waiting muffin cups. Sprinkle more chocolate chips on top then cook for 20 minutes or until the muffins are dark, risen and springy.
