Io To make the sauce, heat the sesame oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and saute for 5 minutes, or until soft and aromatic (be careful not to burn). Place the kuzu in a small bowl. Add the shoyu, vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of the water, and stir to dissolve the kuzu. Add the remaining water, mix well, then add to the saucepan with the garlic. Stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer 2 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. Stir the sesame seeds into the sauce, and set aside. To make the pancakes, whisk together the flour, salt, pepper, and baking powder (if using) in a large bowl. Slowly stir in the water to form a smooth pourable batter (it should be thinner than regular pancake batter). Add more water a little at a time, if necessary. Heat a little olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop the batter onto the skillet from a ¼-cup measuring cup. Generously cover the uncooked side of the pancake with scallions. Cook about 3 minutes or until the bottom is lightly browned. Flip the pancake over and press down lightly with the spatula. Cook another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the edges are brown and curl up slightly. Transfer to a heatproof plate or baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Continue making pancakes with the remaining batter. Drizzle the warm sauce over the pancakes and serve. Variations: • Substitute other flours, such as rice, chickpea, or buckwheat, for all or part of the pastry flour. • To make vegetable pancakes, substitute thinly cut julienned carrots, leeks, and/or daikon for part of the scallions.
