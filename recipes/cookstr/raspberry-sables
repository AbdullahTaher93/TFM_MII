Combine the flour, confectioner's sugar, butter, almond flour, egg yolk, and almond extract in a food processor and process to form a soft dough. Remove from the machine, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. (Or, beat together the sugar, butter, and egg yolk, then stir in the flour, almond flour, and almond extract.) Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly butter two baking sheets. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of 1/8 in (3mm). Using a 3in (7.5cm) round cookie cutter, cut out rounds and transfer to the baking sheet. Gather up the scraps and re-roll as needed, but do not overhandle the dough. Bake for 8–10 minutes, or until pale gold. Let cool slightly on the baking sheets, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Sandwich the cookies together, using about 1 tsp raspberry preserves for each pair.
