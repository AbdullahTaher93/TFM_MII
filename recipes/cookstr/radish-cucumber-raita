Sprinkle the cucumber with the salt and place in a colander to drain for 30 minutes. Rinse briefly under cold running water, drain, and transfer to paper towels. Pat dry. Combine the drained yogurt, cucumber, radishes, and garlic in a small bowl. Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the mustard and cumin seeds and cook until the mustard seeds begin to pop. Add the spice mixture to the raita, taste for salt, and season with cayenne. This is best used right away.
