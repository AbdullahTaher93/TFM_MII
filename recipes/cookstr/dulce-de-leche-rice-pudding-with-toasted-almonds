Mix together 2 cups of the milk, the rice, and the cinnamon stick in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer over medium-low heat until the rice is tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick and set the pan aside. Whisk the remaining ¼ cup milk with the egg yolks in a large bowl. Add a little of the rice mixture at a time, whisking constantly. When all the rice has been added, return the pudding to the pan and cook over low heat, stirring, until the temperature of the pudding reaches 160°F, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the dulce de leche and vanilla. Stir until incorporated. Pour the pudding into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours or overnight. Serve cold, sprinkled with almonds.
