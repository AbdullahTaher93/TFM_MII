Preheat the oven to 425°F. Take the puff pastry from the freezer and allow to lightly thaw (to not quite room temperature). Gently roll out the puff pastry to smooth any creases. Combine the egg and water in a small bowl. Place the puff pastry on a baking sheet and brush with the egg wash. Bake on the middle rack until the puff pastry is golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cut the puff pastry into 4-by-4-inch squares and set aside. Lower the oven temperature to 325°F. In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Add half of the beef cubes and dust with the flour. Shake off any excess flour. Add 1 tablespoon each of the olive oil and the butter to a 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add half of the beef cubes, being sure not to crowd the pan. Cook until the meat starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, turn the meat and cook for 3 minutes more. Transfer to a platter and repeat with another 1 tablespoon each of the olive oil and the butter to cook the remaining meat. Transfer to the platter. In the same pan, add another 1 tablespoon each of the olive oil and the butter and cook the mushrooms until they start to brown and release liquid. Transfer to a small bowl and reserve. Add the remaining olive oil and butter to the skillet, and cook the onion, carrots, and celery until the onions become translucent. Return the mushrooms to the skillet. Add the garlic, thyme, and oregano, and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the beef broth, Guinness, and Worcestershire sauce and stir. Add the beef cubes and gently mix in, coating well with the onion-mushroom mixture. Cover tightly with foil and/or a lid and place in the oven for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and season with salt and pepper. Serve the stew in warmed bowls, each sprinkled with cheese and topped with a puff pastry square.
