In a bowl, whisk together the flours, cornmeal, wheat germ, baking powder, cardamom, baking soda, and salt. In a small, deep bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft, glossy peaks form. In another bowl, beat or whisk together the egg yolks, buttermilk, milk, oil, and honey. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Fold in the egg whites. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat and grease lightly. For each pancake, spoon or pour about ¼ cup batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look dry, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute more. Serve immediately or transfer pancakes to a baking sheet and keep warm in a 200°F oven. Bake the remaining batter as directed. Top with yogurt and fruit or Sugar-Free Apple Spread.
