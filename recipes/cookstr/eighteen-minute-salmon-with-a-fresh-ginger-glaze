Place the salmon in a 13 by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish and set it aside. Place the soy sauce, honey, ginger, add garlic in a small mixing bowl and stir to combine. Pour the soy sauce mixture over the salmon, lifting it up with a fork so that the marinade can run underneath and coat the salmon well. If you have the time, cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for up to 2 hours. Or set the salmon aside while the oven preheats. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Uncover the salmon and bake it until the soy sauce mixture forms a glaze and the fish flakes around the edges, about 18 minutes. If the fillet is thicker in the center than at the edges, the center will cook less quickly; add a few minutes more baking time if needed. If you cut the salmon into pieces, the edges will be less likely to overcook. Remove the pieces of salmon from the oven as they test done. Or, do as we do in my house-cook the salmon all at once, saving the edges for the kids and the more rare center for the adults who prefer it that way. The salmon is also delicious served cold. 3.
