Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch pie pan with the crust and then bake the crust as directed in the recipe. To make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the egg yolks and the milk. Use a whisk or fork to mix them together evenly and well. Add the lime juice and salt, and stir well until you have a smooth, thick filling. Spoon the filling into the graham cracker crust. Place the pie on the middle shelf of the oven, and bake for 15 minutes, until the filling is set. Place the pie on a cooling rack or a folded kitchen towel and let cool to room temperature. Cover loosely and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and as long as overnight. To make the topping: Whip the cream in a medium bowl. When it thickens and increases in volume, add the sugar and vanilla, and continue beating until the cream is billowing and thick, able to hold soft peaks beautifully and easily. Pile the whipped cream onto the pie filling. Refrigerate for 1 hour or more before serving. Serve cold.
