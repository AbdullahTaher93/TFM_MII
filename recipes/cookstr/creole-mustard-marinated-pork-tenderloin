Place the tenderloins in a large sealable plastic bag. To make the marinade, whisk together all of the ingredients in a large bowl and pour over the tenderloins in the plastic bag. Marinate 4 to 8 hours in the refrigerator. For the meat, grill the pork approximately 15 to 25 minutes or until the temperature reaches 150°F in the center with a meat thermometer. Let the meat rest, uncovered, 10 minutes before slicing. Serve this with the Red Wine Cherry Sauce if you would like a sauce to accompany the meat. Variation: A 4-pound pork roast may be substituted (marinade is plenty) and cooked in the oven at 350°F with a thermometer inserted. The internal temperature should be approximately 155°F. Let it rest 10 minutes so the juices disperse. Pork chops or grilled steaks taste wonderful after marinating in this mixture as well.
