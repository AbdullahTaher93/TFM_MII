Mix all of the ingredients except the scallops, salt and pepper, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a bowl. Chill this mixture over an ice-water bath. Chill four small serving plates. Just before you are ready to serve, season the dressing with salt and pepper. Arrange the scallops on the chilled plates. Spoon the dressing over them. Sprinkle a drop of sesame oil and soy sauce on each plate, and serve immediately.
