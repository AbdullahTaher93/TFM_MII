Spray a small slow cooker with nonstick spray. Combine all the ingredients, except the vanilla, in the slow cooker. Cover the slow cooker and cook on high for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until a thermometer inserted into the mixture reads 220Â°F. Stir in the vanilla. Whisk until smooth. Unplug the slow cooker and let stand, covered, for 1 hour. Stir before serving. Serve warm.
