TO MAKE THE MEATBALLS: In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients except the pecorino for sprinkling and stir until the mixture is uniform. Let rest for 30 minutes. Make meatballs Â½ inch (13 mm) in diameter and place them on a baking sheet. Freeze for at least 2 hours (or overnight). Take the meatballs out of the freezer 5 minutes before cooking. In a medium (8- to 12-quart [7.6- to l1.4-L]) stockpot, warm the Vegetable Stock over medium heat. Once the stock is warmed through, put the frozen meatballs, several at a time, into the stockpot. Boil the meatballs for 7 to 8 minutes, until they are cooked through. With a slotted spoon, take the meatballs out of the stock and place them on a plate lined with paper towels. Transfer the meatballs to a serving platter and serve warm, sprinkled with the remaining pecorino.
