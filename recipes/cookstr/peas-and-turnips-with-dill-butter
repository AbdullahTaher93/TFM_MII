In a small bowl, mix together 6 tablespoons of the butter and 3 tablespoons of the dill to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (The dill butter may be made 2 days ahead if covered and refrigerated.) In a skillet, sauté the bacon, if using, over medium heat until brown and crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Let the bacon cool to room temperature. In a large nonstick skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Add the turnips and sauté for about 9 minutes, or until tender and golden. If you find the turnips taste sharp, add a little sugar. Add the peas and dill butter and cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes, or until the peas are heated through and the butter melts. Stir in the bacon, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl, garnish with the remaining tablespoon of dill, and serve.
