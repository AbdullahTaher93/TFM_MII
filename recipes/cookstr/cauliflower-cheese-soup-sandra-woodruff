For Easy-to-Chew and Soft Diets: Place the margarine or butter in a 3-quart pot and melt over medium heat. Add the onion or leek, cover, and cook for several minutes, or until the vegetable starts to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 30 additional seconds. Add the cauliflower, water, bouillon granules, marjoram, and pepper to the pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft. Stir the evaporated milk into the soup. Purée the soup with a hand-held blender until smooth. Add the cheese to the pot and, stirring constantly, cook over medium heat for a minute or 2, or just until the cheese has melted. Serve hot. For Smooth/Puréed Diets: Working in batches, purée the entire pot of soup in a standing blender until smooth (see Notes).
