Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a heavy baking sheet with parchment paper. Thaw puff pastry, if frozen. In a small bowl, mix the cinnamon and sugar. Peel, core, and cut the apples in half. Place one half, cut side down, on a cutting board. With a small sharp knife, thinly slice the apple half into about 12 slices. Do not move or separate the slices. Repeat with the remaining 5 halves. Leave cut side down. Place the puff pastry on a cold surface. Cut into 6 rectangles and place on the baking sheet. Pick up one apple half without disturbing the slices. Place on a pastry rectangle and apply slight pressure on the diagonal to fan out the apple slices until they nearly fill the length of the pastry rectangle. Leave a border of ¼ inch all the way around. Repeat with remaining rectangles of puff pastry and apple halves. Sprinkle each tartlet with the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Drizzle with the melted butter. Bake for 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden around the edges and the apples are softened. Drizzle each with 1 teaspoon maple syrup. Serve warm or at room temperature. These are best served the day they are made.
