In a large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil over high heat. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and sear 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and reserve. In the same pan, heat the remaining oil until shimmering, adding more, if needed. Saut√© the artichoke hearts until light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add the beans and thyme and toss to heat through. Add 6 tablespoons of the sherry vinaigrette and the shrimp and toss to heat through. Remove the pan from the heat. Toss the mesclun with the remaining sherry vinaigrette (or just enough to coat lightly). To serve, divide the mesclun among 4 plates or shallow bowls and place a few spoonfuls of the artichoke-shrimp mixture in the center of the greens. Variation: For sherry vinaigrette, substitute 4 tablespoons Lobster Vinaigrette combined with 2 tablespoons sherry vinaigrette.
