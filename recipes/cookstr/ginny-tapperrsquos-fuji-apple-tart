Preheat the oven to 370°F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and set aside. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together on medium speed, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla. Add the flours to the butter mixture, and mix on low speed until combined. Transfer the mixture to the prepared tart pan and press in evenly over the bottom and sides. Make the custard filling: In a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix the cream cheese and sugar on medium speed until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla, and mix until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Pour the filling into the tart shell. Make the apple topping: Peel, core, and finely slice the apples. (I like to slice the apples by hand, but Matthew’s grandma admitted to using a mandoline.) Toss in a bowl with the sugar and cinnamon. Arrange the apple slices in a single overlapping layer around the outer edge of the tart. Then make an apple rose center by arranging slices, on their edges, in the custard, overlapping, in a circle until completely filled in. Bake the tart for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the filling has puffed up and the apples’ edges have browned. Let cool. Melt the marmalade with the brandy in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until smooth. Strain the mixture into a small bowl, and apply it to the apples with a pastry brush. Store the tart, well wrapped, in the refrigerator. Allow it to come to room temperature for serving. To serve, carefully remove the sides of the tart pan and place the tart on an elegant serving plate.
