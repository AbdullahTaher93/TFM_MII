By Hand: Pour boiling water into a large mortar to warm it; discard the water and dry the mortar. Place the garlic and salt in the mortar and mash together evenly with a pestle to form as smooth a paste as possible. (The fresher the garlic, the easier it will be to crush.) Add the egg yolks. Stir, pressing slowly and evenly with the pestle, always in the same direction, to thoroughly blend the garlic paste and yolks. Continue stirring, gradually adding just a few drops of the oil, whisking until thoroughly incorporated. Do not add too much oil in the beginning or the mixture will not emulsify. As soon as the mixture begins to thicken, add the remaining oil in a slow and steady stream, whisking constantly. Taste for seasoning. Transfer to a bowl. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend. The mayonnaise can be stored, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days. In a food processor or a blender: Combine the garlic, salt, and egg yolks and process until well blended.With the motor running, very slowly add several tablespoons of oil, processing until the mixture thickens. With the motor still running, slowly add the remaining oil in a steady stream. Taste for seasoning. Transfer to a small bowl.Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend. The mayonnaise can be stored, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days.
