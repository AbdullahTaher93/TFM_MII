Cut the chicken into strips the size of a baby’s index finger. Pour the flour on a plate or in a small bowl. Dredge the chicken in the flour and shake off the excess flour. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy sauté pan over high heat until it is hot but not smoking. Gently drop the chicken in the pan, evenly distributing it around the pan. (Be careful; this can be dangerous because the oil is very hot. If you carelessly drop the chicken in, it’ll splatter on your arms and face.) Let the chicken cook, sitting in one spot. Check the underside of one piece. When it becomes medium brown, use the handle of the fry pan to toss the pan and flip the chicken pieces in the pan. It is really hard to flip every piece; just toss the pan a few times to get most of the chicken turned and then use tongs to turn the few remaining pieces so that all the brown faces up. Add the vegetables. Cut the noodles with scissors so they drop in the pan, and toss. Squeeze the juice of the lemon over everything, drizzle with soy sauce, and then add the chicken stock. Agitate the pan to coat the chicken and noodles with a sticky brown-black glaze and finish cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve in a stainless-steel Chinese dome set if you have one.
