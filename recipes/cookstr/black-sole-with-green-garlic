In a medium bowl, mix the butter and garlic shoots or chives together well with a wooden spoon. Put about half the butter mixture into a small bowl and set aside. Melt the remaining butter mixture in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches if necessary, fry the fillets, skin side up, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until just beginning to color. Turn the fillets over, quickly season with salt and pepper, then transfer to a warmed serving platter. Drizzle the melted butter and pan juices over the fish. Serve with the remaining butter mixture on the side.
