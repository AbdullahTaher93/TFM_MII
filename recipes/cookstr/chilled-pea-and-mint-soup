Pour the stock into a large bowl or pan and add the fresh mint stalks and the dried mint and leave to steep for 20 minutes to half an hour. If you’re using fresh peas, pour the stock along with the mints and pea pods directly into a pan and boil for about 10–15 minutes and then strain into a pitcher. Pour the oil into a large saucepan and warm over medium heat. Add the chopped scallions and turn in the warm oil for a few minutes until slightly softened and then tumble in the peas. If you’re using frozen ones, there is no need to defrost them first. Cook these, stirring with a wooden spatula all the while, over a low to medium heat until the peas have softened a little. Fish out the mint stalks from the stock and pour into the pan, or use the strained pod stock. It’s impossible, really, to say exactly how long it will take for the peas to be sufficiently soft, but think around 3–5 minutes. Leave to cool, and then blitz, in batches, in a blender or processor. Season to taste. If you’re making this at all in advance, it’s best to keep the pea purée creamless in the refrigerator until serving, at which time you should ideally blend it again with the sour cream. Pour into cups or bowls and sprinkle with the chopped, reserved mint leaves.
