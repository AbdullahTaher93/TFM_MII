Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Trim any fat or gristle from the pork with a sharp knife or a cleaver. Mix the Barbecue Sauce ingredients in a bowl. Add the pork and toss to coat. Place the pork on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until cooked through. Let cool. Cut the pork into slices about ¾ inch thick and 1½ inches long.
