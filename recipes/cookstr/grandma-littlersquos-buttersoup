In a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, combine lima beans, carrots, celery, tomatoes, and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour. In a small skillet over very low heat, melt all but 1 teaspoon butter. Add onion and parsley and cook until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour until smooth. Add to simmering soup, stirring constantly, until blended. In same skillet over high heat, melt the remaining butter and cook the pasta until golden, about 3 minutes. Add to the soup, season with salt and pepper, and simmer until the pasta is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
