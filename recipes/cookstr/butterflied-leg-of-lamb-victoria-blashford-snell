To prepare the lamb, place it on a work surface, skin side down. Make 3 deep cuts in the thickest parts of the lamb, being sure not to cut all the way through. Place a piece of plastic wrap over the lamb and pound heavily with a flat meat pounder to give the meat a fairly even surface. For the marinade, combine the wine, soy sauce, garlic, and mint in a large zippered plastic bag. Add the lamb, close the bag, and refrigerate at least 2 hours. For the salsa, heat the oil in a saucepan over low heat. Add the garlic and chile and cook 3 minutes, until the garlic starts to color. Add the tomatoes and marjoram and simmer for 30 minutes, until the tomatoes are softened. Add the peppers and cook for 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Build a medium-hot fire in an outdoor grill. Remove the lamb from the marinade and pat dry. Grill, turning occasionally, about 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the lamb reads 130째F ( 55째C). Let stand 10 minutes. Slice and serve with the sauce passed on the side. 4. Build a medium-hot fire in an outdoor grill. Remove the lamb from the marinade and pat dry.
