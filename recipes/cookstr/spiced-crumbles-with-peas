If the grounds are frozen, defrost completely. Turn the slow cooker to high. Put the defrosted crumbles, oil, and onion in the slow cooker and mix well. Allow to heat while you prep other ingredients. In a food processor, grind the ginger, garlic, and green chiles. Add this mixture to the slow cooker. Put the tomato puree into a bowl and add the boiling water. Carefully whisk until the paste dissolves. Add this mixture to the slow cooker along with the crushed cardamom seeds or pods, bay leaves, cumin, coriander, red chile powder, salt, turmeric, and garam masala. Mix well. Cook on high for 3 hours. Add the cilantro and peas. If the peas are fresh, cook them in boiling water for about 3 minutes before adding. You can add frozen peas without boiling them, but let the dish sit for about 10 minutes before serving to warm them up. Eat over basmati or brown rice with chopped, fresh onions on top. If you need a more comfort, drizzle a little more oil over the top. Try This! James, one of my most loyal taste testers, suggests taking large button mushrooms, cutting away the stems, and stuffing them with mock keema. Sprinkle some spicy cheese over the top and bake the stuffed mushrooms in the oven at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes. You can also use this “meat” in tacos.
