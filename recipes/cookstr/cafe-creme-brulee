In a small, heavy saucepan, combine sugar, 2 Tbsp. water, and salt; stir to combine. Cook without stirring over medium heat until mixture turns a deep golden brown. Immediately remove from heat. Stirring constantly with a long-handled wooden spoon, very gradually add remaining 1 cup water, being careful of spatters. Mixture will clump and harden. Return pan to medium heat and stir constantly until mixture is smooth. Add espresso powder, stirring to dissolve. Add cream; cook over low heat, stirring often, until mixture begins to simmer. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Taste and sweeten with sugar, if desired. Pour into warm mugs. If desired, garnish with a dollop of whipped cream, topped with an orange twist. Or simply drop the orange twist into the coffee sans whipped cream. Variations: Iced Café Crème Brûlée: After sweetening the finished drink, refrigerate until very cold, about 3 hours. Serve in tall, ice-filled glasses; top with a dollop of whipped cream, if desired. Café Crème Brûlée Frappe: (Serves 4) Increase espresso powder to ¼ cup. Refrigerate mixture until chilled. Combine mixture with 6 scoops of slightly softened coffee, vanilla, or chocolate ice cream in a blender. Cover and process at medium speed until smooth. Pour into tall glasses; top with whipped cream, if desired. Serve with straws and iced-tea spoons.
