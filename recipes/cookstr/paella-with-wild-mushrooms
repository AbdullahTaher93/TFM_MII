Prepare the sofrito. In a 16-to 18-inch paella pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil over medium-low heat. Add the tomatoes and 2 pinches of salt, and cook, stirring from time to time, until the tomato has darkened to a deeper shade of red and the sofrito is pasty, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a large sauté pan over medium-low heat and cook the mushrooms, garlic, and 2 more pinches of salt until the mushrooms have expelled their liquid, about 5 minutes. Drain and reserve the liquid. Increase the heat to high, and cook mushrooms and garlic for another 2 minutes. Transfer to a platter. When the sofrito is ready, sprinkle in the pimentón and saffron, letting the flavors meld for a few seconds while stirring constantly. Add the vegetable stock plus the reserved broth from the mushrooms, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Check for salt, adjusting the seasoning as needed. Sprinkle in the rice. With a wooden spoon, probe the pan to make sure this rice is evenly distributed. Do not stir again. Distribute the mushrooms evenly around the pan. Cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cook for an additional 8 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al punto, with just a bite to it. Remove the paella from the heat, cover with paper towels, and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
