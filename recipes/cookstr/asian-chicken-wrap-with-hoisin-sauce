For the chicken, mix the soy sauce, sherry, and cornstarch in a small bowl. Add the chicken strips and mix to thoroughly coat the chicken. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the chicken and cook, stirring almost constantly, until it turns white, about 3Â½ minutes. Transfer to a plate. For the vegetables, heat the oil in the same skillet over high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until they give off their juices and begin to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in the scallions and garlic, and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the coleslaw mix, broth, and soy sauce. Add the chicken. Cook, stirring often, until the coleslaw is wilted and heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir in the hoisin sauce. For each wrap, place one-fourth of the chicken mixture on a tortilla and roll up. Serve hot.
