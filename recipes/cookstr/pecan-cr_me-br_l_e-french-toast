EQUIPMENT: One 10-inch gratin dish In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup and cook over low heat, stirring, until the better melts and the ingredients are well mixed and just a bit bubbly around the edges. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the oil and chopped pecans. Pour the syrup into the gratin dish. Place the challah slices on top of the pecan syrup in the gratin dish, overlapping them slightly. Beat the eggs in a small bowl. Whisk in the milk and vanilla. Pour this mixture over the challah so the bread can soak up the liquid. Push the challah slices under the liquid until they have absorbed as much as they can. Sprinkle the pecan halves over the top, cover with aluminum foil, and place the dish in the refrigerator to chill overnight. The challah will absorb the maximum amount of liquid, creating a French toast that is evenly cooked. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Bake the dish for 30 to 35 minutes, until the egg mixture is set. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until the French toast is golden brown and crusty on the top. Serve warm.
