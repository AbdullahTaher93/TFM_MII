RInse the bones thoroughly, until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside. Combine the olive oil, garlic, diced onion, green onions, celery, and salt in a stockpot over medium heat, and stir. Simmer until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the fish bones and stir, simmering, for 5 minutes. Add the wine and lemon juice, cook for 1 minute, and add the cold water, peppercorns, bay leaves, parsley stems, and thyme. Bring the mixture almost to a boil, and skim off any impurities. Simmer for about 20 minutes, turn off the heat, and let sit for 10 more minutes. Strain the stock through a cheesecloth-lined sieve set over a container that fits well. Ladle the stock from the pot. Do not pour it and do not disturb the solid ingredients or you risk allowing impurities into the finished stock that can cloud the liquid.
