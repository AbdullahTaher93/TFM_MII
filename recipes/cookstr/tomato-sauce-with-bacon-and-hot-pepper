Drain the tomatoes, reserving their juice. Strain the captured juice to hold back the seeds. Using your fingers, push out the excess seeds from each tomato. Roughly chop the tomatoes and set aside with their juice. If using pancetta, cut it into thin strips. If using bacon, drop it into boiling water to cover and blanch for 30 seconds. Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain again. Cut it into thin strips. Combine the olive oil and the garlic in a cold saucepan. Place the pan over medium-low heat and sauté until the garlic begins to color, 3 or 4 minutes. Add the pancetta or bacon and continue to sauté over medium-low heat until it colors nicely, about 6 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes, the tomatoes and their juice, and the salt. Simmer uncovered over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. The sauce should be done in about 20 minutes.
