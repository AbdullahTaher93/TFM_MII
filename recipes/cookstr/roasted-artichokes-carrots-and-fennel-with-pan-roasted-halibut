Preheat the oven to 400°F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cut the lemons in half and squeeze the juice into the salted water. Drop in the shells. Add the artichoke hearts, carrots, and fennel. Cook until all the vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes. Drain and spread on a baking sheet to cool. Season the fish steaks on both sides with salt and pepper and then season each steak with ½ teaspoon of the herbs. Heat the olive oil in a heavy, ovenproof sauté pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the fish and sear for about 2 minutes on each side. Remove the fish to a plate. Replace the pan over medium-high heat and add the artichokes, carrots, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper and the remaining ¼ teaspoon herbes de Provence. Sauté until brown, about 3 minutes. Arrange the fish on top of the vegetables and place the pan, uncovered, in the oven to finish cooking, about 10 minutes. When cooked, remove the fish and vegetables to a warm platter and keep warm while you make the sauce. Place the sauté pan over medium-high heat and add the wine. Bring to a boil, stirring and scraping all the browned bits from the bottom and sides of the pan. Cook until reduced by about two-thirds (this is a brothy sauce). Stir in the fennel leaves and the butter, if using. Taste for seasoning and pour over the fish. Serve immediately.
