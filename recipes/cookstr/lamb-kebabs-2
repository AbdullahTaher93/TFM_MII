Crush the coriander seeds in a mortar and pestle. Place with the lamb, ¼ cup oil, 1 tsp honey, 2 garlic cloves, and the lemon zest in a bowl. Season with pepper and mix. Cover and chill for 2 hours. Whisk together the vinegar with the remaining ½ cup oil, 1 tsp honey, and 2 garlic cloves. Add the tomatoes and cilantro and mix. Preheat the broiler. Thread the meat onto the skewers. Season with salt. Broil, turning, about 7 minutes for medium-rare meat. Serve with the tomato vinaigrette.
