Marinate the shrimp. Break the achiote paste into a blender jar and add the garlic, half of the lime juice, the orange juice, vinegar and ½ teaspoon salt. Blend until smooth. Pour over the shrimp, stirring to coat well, cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Prepare the onions. In a small bowl, combine the onion, habanero (or as much of it as you think you’ll like), the remaining lime juice and 1 scant teaspoon salt. Cover and let stand until the shrimp is ready. (If working ahead, the onions may be stored in the refrigerator, covered, for several days.) Grill and serve the shrimp. Turn on a gas grill to medium-high or light a charcoal grill and let the coals burn until quite hot and covered with white ash. Thread the shrimp on skewers (if using bamboo skewers, it’s best to first soak them in water for a few minutes), leaving most of the marinade in the bowl. Scrape the leftover marinade into a small saucepan, bring to a simmer over medium heat, and stir until darker in color and thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in enough water to bring the sauce to the consistency of a light cream soup. Taste and season with more salt if you think necessary. Cover and keep warm over low heat. Spritz or brush the shrimp with oil, then lay on the hot fire and close the grill. After 2 or 3 minutes, when the shrimp are browned on one side, turn the skewers over and cook the other side: it usually takes a minute or so longer, depending on the exact heat of your fire, to cook the shrimp until just the slightest hint of translucency remains in the center of each piece. Lay the grilled shrimp skewers on a serving platter (or pull the shrimp from skewers before piling on the platter), drizzle with the sauce and sprinkle with chopped cilantro or parsley Serve with the spicy pickled onions.
