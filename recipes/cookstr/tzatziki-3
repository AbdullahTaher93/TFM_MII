Spread the salt on a chopping board and finely chop the garlic on top of the salt. Transfer the garlic and salt to a medium-size bowl, add the yogurt, and stir until creamy. Peel the cucumber and remove the seeds if they are large. Finely chop the cucumber. Squeeze it to remove some of the liquid, then add it to the yogurt. Stir in the mint or dill, if using, the pepper, and the vinegar. Mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
