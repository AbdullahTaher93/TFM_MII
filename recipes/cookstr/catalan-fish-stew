Prepare the fish broth as directed, increasing the water to 1½ cups. Meanwhile, place the clams and mussels in a skillet with ¾ cup water and the lemon slice. Bring to a boil and remove the clams and mussels as they open. Take the clam and mussel meat from the shells and cut the meat in halves. Reserve. Strain the cooking liquid and add to the fish broth. Place the oil and garlic in a shallow casserole, preferably Spanish earthenware. Heat over a medium flame until the garlic is golden on all sides. Transfer the garlic to a processor or blender. Fry the bread slices in the same oil until golden on both sides and transfer the bread to the processor. Add to the processor the almonds, parsley, saffron, and salt. Grind until a paste forms. Add the paprika, flour, and ¼ cup of the fish broth and beat until smooth. Gradually pour in the remaining fish broth. Return this mixture to the casserole. Bring to a boil. Add the fish pieces, wine, peas, salt, and pepper. Cover and simmer about 12 minutes. Stir in the clam and mussel pieces. Serve in soup bowls, and accompany with a Catalán white wine such as René Barbier.
