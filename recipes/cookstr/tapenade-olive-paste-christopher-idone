Place all the ingredients in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse on and off until the tapenade is grainy but not smooth. Place the mixture in a container, cover, and refrigerate. (If kept covered and refrigerated the tapenade should keep for up to 8 weeks, covered and refrigerated.) Serve with cold vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, or as a sandwich enhancer.
