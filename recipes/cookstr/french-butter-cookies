Preheat the oven to 375Â°F after placing the rack to the center of the oven. In a mixer place the butter, vanilla and sugar and whip with the paddle attachment until fluffy. Add the eggs and whip on medium speed for 3 minutes, scrap the bottom and the sides of the bowl to clear the bowl of unmixed batter. Add the flour and mix until just well blended, scrape the bowl again and turn the mixer on just until all of the flour is mixed in. Roll the dough into small balls and press the balls down into the cookie sheet. Bake until light brown, about 12-15 minutes. Cool on paper towels. Dip or drizzle in chocolate after completely cooled.
