Make the pastry dough: In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, curry powder, salt, and cayenne. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the shortening until it resembles coarse meal. Tossing with a fork, gradually sprinkle in the ice water, mixing just until the mixture is moist enough to hold together when pinched between your thumb and forefinger. (You may need to add more water.) Gather the dough and form it into a flat disk, wrap it in waxed paper, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Make the filling: Heat the butter in a large skillet. Add the ground beef, onion, chile pepper, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Then add the flour, curry powder, salt, thyme, and allspice, and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the tomato paste and water and cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and allow the filling to cool completely. Position a rack in the top third of the oven, and preheat to 400°. Lightly grease a baking sheet. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to form a 12- by 14-inch rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Cut it into eight 6- by 3-inch rectangles. Place about ¼ cup of the filling in the center of each rectangle, fold it over to enclose the filling, and press the edges with a fork to seal them. Transfer the patties to the prepared baking sheet, and brush them lightly with the beaten egg. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
