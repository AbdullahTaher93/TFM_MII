Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two large cool baking sheets with parchment paper. Dough: Sift the flour, baking soda, spices, and salt on a sheet of waxed paper; set aside. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter at medium-low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in the sugar at medium speed until creamy. Add the egg and beat just until fluffy, then gradually add the molasses until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Lower speed, gradually blend in the dry ingredients, and mix just until thoroughly combined. Using a 16-inch pastry bag fitted with a Â½-inch plain decorating tip (such as Ateco #6), pipe half teaspoons of dough 1 inch apart on cool baking sheets. Decoration: Using a damp pastry brush, flatten the cookies slightly to remove the tip left from piping. Generously sprinkle the sesame seeds over cookies. With another baking sheet, press down evenly on cookies to flatten them all at once. Bake, one sheet at a time, for 8 minutes, or until cookies are flat, feel slightly firm to the touch, and are cinnamon brown. Place baking sheet on a wire rack to cool. Lift cookies from parchment when cool. Stack in an airtight metal container at room temperature and store up to 1 week.
