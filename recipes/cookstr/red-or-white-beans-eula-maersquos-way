Heat the bacon drippings in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions, bell peppers, and celery and cook, stirring, until lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and salt pork and cook for 5 minutes. Add the beans and enough water to cover. Stir in the salt, black pepper, Tabasco, and bay leaves, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, partially covered, until the beans are tender and the mixture is creamy, about 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add more water or broth if the mixture becomes dry. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Serve hot, garnished with green onions and parsley, over rice.
