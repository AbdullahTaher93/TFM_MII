Place the beans in a large casserole or saucepan, cover with cold water, and bring to boil over high heat. Remove from the heat and allow to stand covered for 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse the beans in cold water, drain, and return them to the casserole with the carrot, closed onion, head of garlic, and one bouquet garni. Add water to cover by 1 inch (2 to 2½ quarts). Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until the beans are tender yet still firm, 1 to 1½ hours. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid, and discard the carrot, onion, head of garlic, and bouquet garni. Reduce the liquid over high heat until it thickens and only 1 cup remains. Pour this sauce over the beans and set aside. In a skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the butter over low heat. Add the chopped onions, cover, and cook slowly until soft, about 6 minutes. Add the tomatoes, chopped garlic, and remaining bouquet garni. Season with the salt and pepper, cover, and simmer gently until the tomatoes soften and a sauce forms, about 30 minutes. Remove the bouquet garni. Add the tomato sauce, which should not be watery, to the cooked beans. (At this point the beans may be stored in the refrigerator for several days or frozen.) Before serving, bring the beans slowly to a boil. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve hot.
