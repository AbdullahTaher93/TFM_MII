Discard soaking water and rinse beans well in a colander. Place beans in a 5-quart saucepan or Dutch oven. Cover with water; add baking soda and bring to a boil. Discard water and rinse beans again in a colander. Return beans to pan; add 8 cups water, the ham bone, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat, cover partially with a tilted lid, and cook about 1 to 1¼ hours or until beans are tender and liquid has evaporated. Taste and salt if necessary Heat oven to 350° F. Remove ham bone to platter; trim off any remaining meat and discard bone. Coarsely chop meat and stir back into beans. If using slab bacon, allow bacon to remain in beans. Turn beans into a shallow 2-quart baking dish; top with sliced bacon and bake, uncovered, 30 to 35 minutes or until bubbly and bacon has browned.
