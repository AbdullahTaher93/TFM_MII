Place the squash in one or two large kettles filled with cold water. Bring to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt per squash. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain. Cut each squash in half and remove the seeds. Remove the pulp fro the rind. Lightly puree the pulp in the food processor. Add the butter, salt and pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Serve hot.
