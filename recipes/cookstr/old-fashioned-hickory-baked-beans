Spread the beans on a baking sheet and pick through them, discarding any discolored beans or empty shells. Next, place the beans in a colander, rinse them, then transfer them to a medium pot. Add the water and soak 8 hours or overnight. When the beans have finished soaking, drain them and replace the leftover soaking water with an equal amount of fresh water. Add the kombu. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 300°F. To prepare the seasoning mixture, combine ½ cup water with 2 tablespoons sesame oil, the tomato paste, miso, barley malt syrup, mustard, and hickory-smoke flavoring. Add this mixture along with the onions to the beans and water. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of sesame oil in a heavy skillet, and pan-fry the seitan until it is crispy. Place the seitan and beans in a narrow-necked stoneware bean pot (or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting cover). Cover and bake the beans for 3-4 hours, stirring them periodically. Check often to make sure they don’t dry out. Add a little hot water to the pot as needed.
