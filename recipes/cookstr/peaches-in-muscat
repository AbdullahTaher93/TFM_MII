Over a bowl (to catch juices), cut each peach into slices. When all the peaches are sliced, pour in the Muscat wine and make sure the peaches are more or less fully immersed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 6 hours; sometimes it helps to be able to get stuff done in advance. Remove the peaches to a pretty glass bowl or to individual small glasses and serve — still chilled — with a pitcher of heavy cream or some vanilla ice cream alongside.
