Heat the oil over medium heat. Add the shallots, celery, garlic, anchovies, and hot pepper. Cook, stirring often, until softened. Stir in the tomatoes, wine, and clam juice, bring to a boil, then simmer for 20 minutes. Add the shrimp, scallops, lemon juice, and capers. Cook about 5 minutes, or until the seafood is opaque. Season with salt and pepper.
