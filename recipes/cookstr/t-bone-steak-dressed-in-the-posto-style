Pat the steaks dry and set aside to come to room temperature. Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels, crumble, and set aside. Discard all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat from the pan. Add the beans, sage, and rosemary and stir together. Cook the garlic in a small dry skillet until golden and crisp and add to the beans. Set aside. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1 tablespoon of the butter and the olive oil. Place the steaks in the skillet and sear until well-crusted on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn and sear the second side for 3 minutes. Turn again and cook 3 minutes more for medium-rare or 4 minutes more for medium. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Pour off the cooking oil, return the skillet to the heat, and add the wine. Bring to a boil over high heat and reduce by half, about 5 minutes. Add the broth and reduce 3 minutes more. Meanwhile, warm the beans over medium heat and season with salt and pepper. Carve the steaks and arrange the slices in the center of 4 warm plates. Top with a sprinkling of crumbled bacon. Pour the meat juices into the wine sauce and stir in the remaining Â½ tablespoon of butter. Spoon the fava beans around the steak and spoon sauce over all.
