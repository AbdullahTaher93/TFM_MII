Meanwhile, shell and devein the shrimp. In a large nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and green onions and sauté for 3 minutes or just until the shrimp turn opaque (do not overcook). Spread the shrimp mixture over the bottom of the partially baked shell. Toss the cheese with the flour and sprinkle over the shrimp. In a medium-size bowl, whisk the eggs, egg white, tarragon, salt, and pepper until frothy. Whisk in the milk until blended. Pour this mixture over the cheese mixture in the partially baked shell. Bake for 30 minutes or until puffed and golden. Let the quiche stand on a wire rack for 5 minutes before serving.
