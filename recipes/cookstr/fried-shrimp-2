Peel the shrimp, leaving their heads and tails attached. Cut off the very ends of the tails, about 1/8 inch, since this part contains water. Briefly rinse the shrimp in cold water. Drain the shrimp, and wipe them dry with a paper towel. Make a very shallow lengthwise cut on the back of each shrimp, and devein it. Make several shallow diagonal transverse cuts on the belly side, and bend the head and tail back to stretch the belly side. This prevents the shrimp from curling during cooking. Lightly salt and pepper the shrimp. Put the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs into three separate bowls. Dust each shrimp with flour, and coat it with egg. Return the shrimp to the flour, dip it into the egg again, and then coat it with the breadcrumbs. In a deep skillet, heat 3 inches oil to 330 degrees F. Cook the shrimp one or two at a time for about 3 to 4 minutes. At the end of the cooking, increase the heat to 355 degrees F to achieve a light golden color and crisp texture. Drain the shrimp on a rack. Serve the shrimp hot, with cabbage, tomato, and cucumber, with mayonnaise sauce in a saucer on the side.
