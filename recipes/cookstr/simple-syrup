Place the sugar and 4 cups of cold water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar has dissolved. Continue to boil for 5 minutes and remove from the heat. When the syrup is cool, refrigerate in a covered container. The syrup will keep for two weeks under refrigeration and can be frozen indefinitely.
