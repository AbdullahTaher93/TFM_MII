In a large saucepan over high heat, combine the potatoes with water to cover and bring to a boil. Add ¼ teaspoon of the salt, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well. Return the potatoes to the warm pan, add ½ cup of the half-and-half, and beat with an electric mixer or potato masher until smooth. Use additional half-and-half or milk if needed for desired consistency. Cut 2 tablespoons of the butter into small pieces and beat into the potatoes. Add the remaining ½ teaspoon salt and the pepper and fluff with a fork. Transfer to a warmed bowl, dot the remaining butter on top, and serve immediately. Variations: For horseradish mashed potatoes Add 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish sauce, or more to taste, to the mashed potatoes. For garlic mashed potatoes Cook 2 or 3 peeled garlic cloves with the potatoes and mash with the potatoes. For Dijon mashed potatoes Add 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard to the potatoes.
