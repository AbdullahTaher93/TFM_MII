To make the dough, sift the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a medium-size bowl twice. Place in a food processor and add the shortening. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the eggs and sour cream and pulse lightly until the dough gathers into a ball. Remove from the processor and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. To make the filling, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the ground beef Cook, breaking it up, until lightly browned all over, about 5 minutes. Add the dill and season with salt and pepper. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat mixture to a plate. In the same skillet over low heat, brown the flour in the leftover butter and fat. Add the water and stir until thickened, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Return the meat to the pan and coat with the sauce. Remove from the heat and set aside until you are ready to make the dumplings. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Roll out the dough as thinly as possible on a lightly floured surface and, using a cookie cutter or a highball glass, cut circles 3 inches in diameter. Place 1 teaspoon of the meat mixture in the center of each circle. Wet the edges of the dough with a little water, fold in half, and pinch the edges together to seal. Place on greased and floured cookie sheets, and brush with the egg wash. 6. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.
