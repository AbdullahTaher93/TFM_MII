Gradually add vanilla, confectionerâ€™s sugar and milk, mixing on low speed until it starts to cream together, about 3 minutes. Increase speed and beat until light and fluffy, for 2 minutes. Variation: Breakfast Roll Cream Cheese Drizzle: For a thinner icing, add an extra 1 1/2 tbsp (22 mL) milk to icing.
