Preheat the oven to 425° F. Prebake the pie crust until golden. Remove to a cooling rack. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°. Wash the rhubarb pieces and drain. In a non-aluminum saucepan, combine the rhubarb with the sugar and tapioca. Cover and simmer over moderately low heat until the rhubarb is tender, about 12 minutes. Turn the mixture into a bowl to cool to room temperature. When cooled, spread the rhubarb filling evenly in the pie shell. Prepare the meringue: With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until foamy.Gradually add the sugar, and beat until the whites are stiff and glossy. Place the meringue in a pastry bag fitted with a star tube and pipe the meringue in lattice fashion over the rhubarb mixture. Bake the pie for 10 minutes, or until the meringue is golden. Serve at room temperature.
