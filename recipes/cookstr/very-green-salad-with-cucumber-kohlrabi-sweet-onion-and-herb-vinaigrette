In a food processor, mince the garlic and shallot. Scrape down the sides, then add the parsley, tarragon, basil, and rosemary. Pulse to chop. Add the vinegar, agave nectar, salt, pepper, mustard, and 1 tablespoon water. Pulse again. With the machine running, slowly pour in the oil in a thin stream. Place the cucumber, lettuce, onion, and kohlrabi in a large bowl. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and toss to coat.
