Pour some salt onto a small plate wide enough to accommodate the rim of a beer glass. Moisten the rim of the glass with the lime wedge or wheel and coat it with the salt. Fill the glass about halfway with ice. Combine the lime juice, hot sauce, and Maggi in the glass, adding the beer last. Stir gently to combine. Garnish with the lime wedge.
