In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and stir 1 minute. Add the ground lamb and cook, stirring often, until the meat loses its pink color, about 5 minutes. Drain off any excess fat. Add the cinnamon, salt, cumin, curry powder, chili powder, pepper, and cloves, and stir for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let the lamb filling cool completely. Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, process the chutney and orange juice until smooth. Cover, and let stand at room temperature until ready to serve. Place a wonton skin on a work surface. Place about 2 teaspoons of lamb filling in the center. Moisten the edges of the wonton with water, fold it over diagonally to form a triangle, and press the edges to seal. Repeat the procedure with the remaining skins and filling. Preheat the oven to 200°. In a large skillet, pour enough vegetable oil to reach ½ inch up the sides. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it is hot but not smoking. (An electric skillet set at 350° works well.) In batches, fry the samoosas, turning once, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried samoosas to a paper towel-lined baking sheet, and keep them warm in the oven while frying the remaining samoosas. Serve the samoosas warm, with the chutney dip on the side.
