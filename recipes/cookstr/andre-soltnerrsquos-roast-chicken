Place 2 of the thyme sprigs, 2 of the tarragon sprigs, 2 of the parsley sprigs, and 1 onion inside each poussin cavity. Truss the birds. Remove the leaves from the remaining sprig of tarragon and set aside. Preheat the oven to 450°F. On the stove, heat a roasting pan over high heat. Add the peanut oil and brown the poussins on all sides. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place the pan in the oven. Roast, basting frequently with the pan juices, until a chicken leg registers 155° to 160°F on an instant-reading thermometer, 20 to 25 minutes. Carefully remove the poussins to a serving platter and keep warm. Drain the fat from the roasting pan. Place the pan over medium heat, add the wine, and using a wooden spoon, scrape the pan well. Add the chicken broth, the reserved tarragon leaves, and minced parsley. Simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Pour the sauce over the poussins and serve immediately.
