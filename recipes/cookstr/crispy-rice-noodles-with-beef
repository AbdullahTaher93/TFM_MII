Heat 2 in (5cm) oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Break the vermicelli into 7 or 8 portions. In batches, add to the hot oil and cook for a few seconds until they turn white and become crisp. Transfer to paper towels. Keep warm. Mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and 1 tbsp water. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok over high heat, stir-fry the beef for 2 minutes, until browned. Transfer to a plate. Add 1 tbsp oil, and stir-fry the garlic and ginger for 30 seconds. Add the asparagus and scallions, stir-fry for 2 minutes, then add the sauce and beef to the pan. Stir-fry until the sauce is thick and boiling. Divide the rice vermicelli among 4 plates. Pile the stir-fry on top, top with cashews, drizzle with sesame oil, and serve immediately.
