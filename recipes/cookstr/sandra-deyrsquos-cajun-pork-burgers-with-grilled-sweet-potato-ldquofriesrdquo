Using your hands, gently combine the pork, onions, garlic, salt, and black and cayenne peppers in a large bowl. Shape into 4 patties about 1 inch thick. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to grill. Combine the mayonnaise and Tabasco in a small bowl and mix well. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Parboil the sweet potato sticks in boiling salted water until almost tender but still firm, 4 to 5 minutes; drain. Brush with the olive oil on all sides. Light a charcoal fire or preheat your gas grill on high. Oil the grillâ€™s cooking surface. Let the coals bum down to a medium-hot fire or adjust the gas grill burners to medium-high. Place the pork patties and sweet potatoes on the grill and cook about 10 minutes per side, until the potatoes are tender and the pork is cooked all the way through. Remove from the grill and immediately sprinkle the potatoes with salt or sugar. Spread the buns with the mayonnaise and top with the burgers, tomato, and lettuce. Serve with the sweet potatoes on the side.
