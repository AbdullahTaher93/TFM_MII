Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two 9-inch-square pans with the 1 tablespoon of butter or margarine. Combine the dry ingredients in large mixing bowl. In a saucepan over low heat, melt the 2 sticks of butter or margarine and stir in the molasses. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until well blended. You can add a tablespoon or two of applesauce to help the ingredients hold together (loosely, rather than a sticky cookie dough). Spread two-thirds of the mixture in pans and press it flat with a fork. Bake for 20 minutes or until the edges start to brown. Remove the pans from the oven and spread the jam over the top. Pour the remaining mixture over the jam and press down very lightly with the fork. Return the pans to the oven until the jam bubbles around the edges and the top turns golden, about 20 minutes. Remove the pans and allow them to cool. Cut 8 bars from each pan, wrap them in aluminum, and store in the refrigerator.
