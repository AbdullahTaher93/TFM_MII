Soak the beans overnight in a large bowl or pot with enough room and water to allow the beans to double in size. Drain the beans in a colander and rinse well. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cumin, oregano, and chile powder. Stir to combine and simmer for about 1 minute. Add the beans, 8 cups cold water, the bay leaves and basil. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat so that the mixture simmers. Cover partially and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beans are tender. Add water as needed to maintain the water level ½-inch above the beans. Season with salt and simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves before serving.
