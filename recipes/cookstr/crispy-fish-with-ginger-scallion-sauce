To prepare the sauce, in a small saucepan over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Sauté 2 teaspoons ginger and the garlic. Add the chicken broth, vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Add the chopped green onions when ready to serve. Make 3 cuts across the fish almost down to the bone. In a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons ginger, 1/8 teaspoon sugar, and the sesame oil and rub the inside and outside of the fish. Marinate for 20 minutes (if longer, cover and refrigerate). Stuff the fish cavity with the sliced green onions and place on a baking sheet or platter. In a small bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, ¼ cup water, ½ tablespoon oil, and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt. Mix into a smooth batter and brush over the fish. Heat the vegetable oil to 375°F. In a wok or large, deep skillet. Deep-fry the fish until golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain well. Place on a platter. Serve with the ginger-scallion sauce on the side.
