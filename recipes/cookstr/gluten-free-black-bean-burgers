1.?In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the onion, bell pepper, and sundried tomatoes and sauté for 5 to 7 minutes, until the onion and peppers start to soften. Add the garlic and sauté for 2 minutes more, until the onion is translucent and the garlic is browning. 2.?Add the tomato paste to the skillet, using a whisk to thin it out. 3.?Add 3 cups (516 g) of the black beans and the water, egg replacer, cumin, onion powder, and red pepper flakes to the skillet. Stir or whisk vigorously until everything is combined. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed. Remove from the heat. 4.?Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 5.?Transfer the mixture in the skillet, along with 1 1/4 cups (231 g) of the quinoa, to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal "S" blade and process until the mixture has the consistency of a paste. 6.?Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl. Using your clean hands, toss the remaining 1 cup (172 g) black beans and the 1/4 cup (46 g) quinoa with the paste. 7.?Form the mixture into a series of 2-inch (5-cm) balls. Flatten them a bit into patties. Place the patties on the prepared baking sheet. 8.?Bake the patties for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven. Assemble on a platter, garnished with the vegan mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, and onion. Serve warm.
