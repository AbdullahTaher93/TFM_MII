Using scissors, cut cayenne pepper pods into small pieces. In the bottom of a small tagine, spice wok or skillet, combine pepper pieces with peppercorns, allspice, cumin, cardamom, fenugreek, cloves and cinnamon. Toast over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly colored and fragrant. Remove from direct heat just as the seeds pop; do not let the spices smoke and burn. Let cool. In a mortar (using pestle) or small electric grinder, pound or grind toasted spices until coarse or finely ground. Store in an airtight (preferably dark) glass jar with lid in a cool place for up to 3 months.
