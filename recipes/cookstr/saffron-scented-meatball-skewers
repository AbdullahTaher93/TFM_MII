Make the dipping sauce up to 1 day before forming and cooking the skewers. In a small skillet, warm the butter over medium heat and add the onion. Sauté the onion for several minutes until softened. Scrape the onion into a small bowl and stir in the remaining sauce ingredients, adding as much lemon juice as you wish for a tangy but not sour flavor. Cover and refrigerate. Add a little water to the sauce later if it thickens too much for dipping. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. In a large bowl, combine all the meatball ingredients and mix well. Form the mixture into ½- to ¾-inch meatballs. Thread four to five meatballs on each skewer. Transfer the skewers to the smoker. Smoke until the meat is cooked through, about 20 to 30 minutes at a temperature of 225° F to 250° F. Serve hot with the chilled dipping sauce.
