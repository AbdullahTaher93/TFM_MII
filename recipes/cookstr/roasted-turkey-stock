Bring the carcass, gizzard, heart, neck, and liquid to a boil in a large stockpot. Skim the fat. Lower the heat. Simmer for 6 hours or longer (I sometimes leave it for 12 hours or longer), skimming from time to time (see Notes). Partially covering the pot with a lid or using an otoshi-buta will mean less evaporation. Otherwise, more water may need to be added for the longer cooking times. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve. The stock can be refrigerated at this point and continued another day. Skim off the fat from the stock. Return to the pot and boil to reduce the liquid to 10 cups (2.5 l). Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for 3 hours. Remove the fat from the top of the and the sediment from the bottom (see Notes). Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze.
