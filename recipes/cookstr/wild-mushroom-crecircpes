Prepare the crêpes. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and sauté the shallots or onions for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and quickly heat through, about 1 minute. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl and let cool. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and mix in the ricotta, goat, or cream cheese, Gruyère cheese, garlic, tarragon, salt and pepper to taste, and sautéed vegetables. Spoon ½ cup of filling in a ribbon down the center of each crêpe, and roll up to enclose. Arrange in a greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish, brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese. Bake in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until heated through. Serve at once.
