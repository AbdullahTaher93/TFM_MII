Cut the artichokes in half length wise, remove the hairy choke, and trim 1 inch of bracts (leaves) from the top. To make the filling, combine the beef, 1 egg, allspice, and salt in a medium mixing bowl and mix well. Fill the cavity of each artichoke with the filling. Put the remaining egg in a shallow dish and beat it; put the matzoh meal in another. Dip each artichoke in egg and then dredge in the matzah meal. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Fry the artichokes, filling-side down, for 2 minutes, or until the breading is golden brown. Place the artichokes in a large skillet in a single layer. Do not stack. To make the sauce, combine the tomato sauce, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and 1 cup water. Mix well. Drizzle the olive oil into a medium ovenproof saucepan. Place the fried artichokes in the saucepan, filling-side up. Sprinkle the artichokes with salt. Cook over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until the artichokes begin to sweat. Pour the sauce over the artichokes. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the artichoke hearts are fork-tender.
