In a blender or food processor, combine 1 tablespoon of the oil, the garlic, ginger, brown sugar, coriander, cumin, mustard, cayenne, turmeric, and vinegar; process until smooth, and set aside. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and carrots, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion and carrot mixture to a 4-quart slow cooker and turn it on Low. Add the spice paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the bell pepper, cauliflower, zucchini, and kidney beans. Pour in the tomato paste mixture, season with salt and pepper, cover, and cook on Low for 6 hours. A few minutes before serving, stir in the peas and allow to heat through for about 10 minutes.
