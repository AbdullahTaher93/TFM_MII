In a large saut√© pan, combine 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, the sausages, and 1/3 cup water. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook for 7 minutes. If any liquid is left, uncover the pan, increase the heat, and cook to evaporate it. Cut each sausage into 4 small pieces and return them to the pan. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil to the sausages, along with the bell peppers and the onions, and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook, tossing often, until the meat and vegetables are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for another 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the oregano, tomatoes, and sugar, and stir to blend. Bring the mixture to a boil. Then reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the red pepper flakes, and serve.
