Place the farro in a pot, cover it with cold water, and add 1 teaspoon salt. Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the farro is just tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. In the meantime, heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft, about 8 minutes. Add the carrot and leek and another pinch of salt and continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 10 minutes. Move some of the vegetables to one side of the pot and add the garlic and chile to the open space. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Mix the garlic into the vegetables and add the tomato paste. Cook until the tomato paste begins to caramelize and become sweet, about 5 minutes. Add the greens, season with salt, and stir to combine. Cook until the greens wilt and release some of their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add about 2 cups of the stock and bring to a simmer. Add the farro and its cooking liquid along with enough of the remaining stock to cover the ingredients. Simmer for 20 minutes, adding more stock if necessary to keep the ingredients covered with liquid. When all of the vegetables are tender and the flavors have combined, adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and cover the pot. Let stand for 10 minutes. Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Offer the cheese for grating on top if desired.
