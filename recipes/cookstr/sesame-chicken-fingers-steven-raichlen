Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Wash and dry the chicken breasts and trim off any fat. Cut the breasts on the diagonal into strips the size of your baby finger. Combine the ingredients for the marinade in a mixing bowl. Add the chicken fingers and stir to mix. Marinate the chicken for 3 hours, stirring once or twice. Drain the chicken fingers in a strainer and blot dry with paper towels. Place the egg white in a shallow bowl and lightly beat with a fork. (Beat enough to break up the white, but not so much that it becomes foamy.) Combine the sesame seeds in another shallow bowl and stir to mix. Lightly spray a nonstick baking sheet with oil. Using two forks, dip each chicken finger in the egg white, letting the excess drip off, then in the sesame seeds, taking care to coat all sides. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake until cooked, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once. Serve at once with the dipping sauces.
