Cook the tomatoes down over medium low heat for a half hour or until they are fairly thick. Break them up with a wooden spatula or spoon. Stir in the butter and flour, kneaded together, and continue to stir until slightly thickened. (If you like, strain the soup before adding the thickening.) Add the soda, and let it cook with the tomatoes for a few minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add some of the tomato mixture to the heavy cream, which should be heated in advance. Slowly stir this back into the rest of the tomato mixture. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Serve with a dash of chopped parsley.
