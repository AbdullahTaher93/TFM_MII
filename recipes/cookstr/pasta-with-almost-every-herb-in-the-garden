Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Meanwhile, place the olive oil in a large saut√© pan. Add the garlic and red pepper and warm over low heat until the garlic is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add all the herbs, the capers, and salt to taste and stir gently. Let the herbs warm over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, at which time the sauce should be quite aromatic. Drain the pasta and, off the heat, toss with the sauce, adding more olive oil as needed. Serve sprinkled with a few spoonfuls of pecorino.
