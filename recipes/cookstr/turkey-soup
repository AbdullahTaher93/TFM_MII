Put all the ingredients with 10 cups of the water in a large soup pot over medium heat, bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Stir to break up all the clumps of stuffing, and mix well. Let the soup simmer for about 1½ hours. Add the remaining 1½ cups of cold water and let simmer for 10 more minutes. Taste for salt and adjust the flavoring if necessary. Serve hot.
