Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Pour 3 cups of water and the salt, if using, in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the rice, cover the pan, and reduce the heat to low. Let the rice simmer until done, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes and olives in half. Toast the pine nuts: Place them in a pie pan and bake them until they are golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer the cooked rice to a shallow bowl and fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Let cool 5 minutes. Pour the pesto over the rice and stir to combine well. Fold in the tomato and olive halves. Transfer the salad to a serving platter and top it with the toasted pine nuts. Serve warm.
