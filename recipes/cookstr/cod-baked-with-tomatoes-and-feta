Cut cod into serving-size portions; pat dry. Dredge lightly in flour. In large skillet, heat half of the oil over medium-high heat; brown cod lightly on both sides. Arrange in 8-inch (2 L) square baking dish; sprinkle with feta. Set aside. Pour remaining oil into skillet; cook onion, garlic and green pepper, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, crushing with fork; stir in olives, oregano, hot pepper flakes and sugar. Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Add parsley; season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon over fish. (Dish can be prepared to this point, cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 8 hours. Add 5 minutes to baking time.) Bake, uncovered, in 375°F (190°C) oven for about 15 minutes or until bubbly.
