If you’re not using leftover chicken, preheat the grill per the Master Instructions for gas or charcoal (see Notes). Brush the chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of the oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the chicken on the cooking grate directly over the heat and grill until no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside and, when almost ready to use, cut into ¼-inch-thick strips. Rollout and shape the dough, then grill the first side of the crust per the Master Instructions (see Notes). Use tongs to transfer it from the grill to a peel or rimless baking sheet. Flip the crust to reveal the grilled side. Spread the entire surface with the garlic paste, then top with the chicken and sprinkle with the Fontina. Finish grilling the pizza per the Master Instructions (see Notes). Just before the pizza is done, toss the romaine with the dressing and 1 tablespoon of the Parmigiano in a medium bowl. Remove the pizza from the grill and immediately top with dressed romaine. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmigiano and season with salt and pepper. Slice and serve immediately.
