In a large plastic bag, add the chicken in with the flour and toss to coat. In a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the butter and add the shallots, mushrooms and garlic. Once the shallots are translucent, about 3 minutes, add the wine or apple brandy and cook until reduced by half. Add the chicken and sauté. Turn heat to medium low and add the stock and thyme. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and add cream and mustard. Cover and simmer 30 to 40 minutes until meat is very tender. Whisk in the butter-flour mixture and continue whisking until desired consistency is reached. Season with salt and pepper and serve with rice. Variations: You may use boneless beef chuck or thinly sliced pork tenderloin to change this recipe. Herbs, spices and onions (red or green onion) can be interchanged to create variations of this meal. Beef broth can replace chicken broth and for pork I like to do half chicken and half beef broth. If the sauce is too creamy for your taste, add a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to enhance the beef flavor. 3 slices of bacon, diced and cooked may be added. Use the grease from the bacon to cook the onions and mushrooms. Top the dish with minced fresh chives. ¼ teaspoon Marjoram and 1 tablespoon of sweet Hungarian paprika can be substituted for other spices in the recipe. A favorite combination of ours came from our good friend Joe Graber. Joe does a version of this and adds 2 teaspoons ground green peppercorns or rinsed, drained and brined green peppercorns to the sauce. The mushrooms in this recipe are optional. When we just need a quick family meal, we make this without mushrooms and everyone loves it!
