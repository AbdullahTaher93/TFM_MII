Mix the flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl. Make a well in the center and add the water and oil. Stir to make a soft dough. Knead on a lightly floured work surface 8-10 minutes. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat the dough with oil, and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place for 45 minutes, until doubled. Briefly knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cut into 8 equal pieces. Flatten each into a round about Â½ in (1cm). Use a rolling pin to make them a little thinner. Place on lightly floured baking sheets, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand about 10 minutes, until puffy. Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. One at a time, add a flatbread. Cook about 3 minutes, until the underside is browned. Turn and cook about 2 minutes to brown the other side. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm.
