In the bowl of an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat together the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla until very smooth. Add 2¼ cups of the confectioners’ sugar and beat well. Add the remaining 2¼ cups sugar and beat until creamy and spreadable. If too thick, add a bit more butter. If too thin, add a little more confectioners’ sugar. Store in an airtight container, in the refrigerator, for up to 3 days.
