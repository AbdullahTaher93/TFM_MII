Cook rice or use cold rice from the night before. In a large bowl, put drained beans and mash them with a fork or a masher. Add all the other ingredients. Mix with a large spoon or fork, or use your hands. Form mixture into patties. Cook until nicely browned in a nonstick frying pan or heavy frying pan (lightly greased). Add a shake of dried dill to the mayonnaise you spread on your burger.
