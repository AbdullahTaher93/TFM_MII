In a medium saucepan, bring the broth, bones, and onion to a boil. Lower the heat slightly. Cook at a low boil for 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Skim the fat. Return the broth to the saucepan. Sprinkle the gelatin over Â½ cup cold water and let sit for 2 minutes. With a spatula, scrape the gelatin into the broth. Heat the broth over medium heat, stirring, until the gelatin is completely dissolved.
