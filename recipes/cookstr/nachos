Position the broiler rack about 8 in (20cm) from the source of heat and preheat. Spread the tortilla chips on a large heatproof platter. Sprinkle the tomatoes, scallions, jalape√±os, and cheese over the chips. Broil for about 4 minutes, until the cheese is melted. Sprinkle with avocado and cilantro. Serve hot, with sour cream passed on the side.
