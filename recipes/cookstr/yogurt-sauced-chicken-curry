In a medium bowl, sprinkle the chicken breast with the lemon juice; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Combine the flour, salt, and pepper on a plate. Dredge the chicken breasts in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. With tongs, transfer the chicken breasts to a plate and set aside. Add the onion and apple to the skillet and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, curry powder, and cardamom, reduce the heat to medium, and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the chicken broth and raisins. Return the chicken to the skillet and bring to a simmer. Cook, covered, until the chicken breasts show no sign of pink at the bone when prodded with the tip of a sharp knife, about 20 minutes. Add the banana and yogurt, and stir constantly just until heated through, about 1 minute. Do not boil. Serve immediately, sprinkled with the cashews.
