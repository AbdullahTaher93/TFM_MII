Advance Preparations: Prepare Streusel. Store in a sturdy container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 1 month. Prepare Butter Pastry as directed. Baking Preparations: Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 400°F. Preparing the Pineapple: One hour before baking the galette, peel the pineapple. Cut it into ¼-inch-thick slices; then cut slices into halves or quarters and remove core. Place on paper towels to absorb some of the juice. Roll out the pastry to a 15- to 16-inch circle 1/8 inch thick. Trim it even with a pastry wheel (or sharp-edged chef’s knife), forming a 14½- to 15-inch circle. Roll it loosely onto the rolling pin and transfer to the ungreased baking sheet or a 12-inch pizza pan. Arrange the pineapple slices over the pastry in concentric circles, overlapping them slightly, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. When you are finished, lift the pastry border and fold it over the edges of the pineapple slices all around the galette. Sprinkle the streusel over the top. Baking and Glazing the Galette: Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and sounds and feels crisp when pierced with a metal skewer in several places. When the galette is finished baking, remove it from oven and brush the warm apricot glaze over the pineapple slices. Serve lukewarm or at room temperature the same day.
