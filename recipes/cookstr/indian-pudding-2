In a medium-size saucepan, heat 2¾ cups of the whole milk over medium heat. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ½ cup of milk with the cornmeal and whisk until smooth. Pour the cornmeal mixture into the hot milk, whisking constantly. Cook until it begins to thicken, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Whisk in the molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, salt, and vanilla. Beat the whole egg and yolk together in a small bowl; add a spoonful of the hot cornmeal mixture and beat well to avoid curdling. Add another spoonful of the hot mixture, stir, then pour the egg mixture into the saucepan and whisk to combine. Remove from the heat. Grease the slow cooker with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Pour the cornmeal pudding mixture into the cooker and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter until melted. Pour in the light cream in a circular motion; do not stir. Cover and cook on LOW until the pudding is set, 8½ to 9 hours. Serve warm, spooned into individual bowls.
