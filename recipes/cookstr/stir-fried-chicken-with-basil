Arrange the chicken breast flat on a cutting board. Holding the blade of your knife horizontal with the board, cut the chicken into thin slices on the diagonal and put them in a bowl. Add the Marinade ingredients and toss the chicken lightly to coat. Heat a wok or large skillet, add 2 tablespoons of the oil, and heat until very hot, about 30 seconds. Add the Seasonings, and stir-fry over high heat about 1½ to 2 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Push to the side of the pan. Add the remaining 1½ tablespoons oil, and heat until very hot. Add the chicken, stirfrying over high heat about 2 minutes, or until the meat changes color and is cooked. Give the premixed Sauce another stir and pour it into the pan. Bring to a boil. Add the fresh basil and mix. Scoop the chicken onto a serving platter and serve with rice and a vegetable, if desired.
