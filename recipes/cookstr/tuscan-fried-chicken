Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice. Cover and marinate for 1 hour at room temperature. Fill a frying pan large enough to hold all of the chicken halfway with the peanut or vegetable oil. Heat to 375° F on a deep-fat thermometer. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in the flour, then dip it in the beaten eggs. Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil, but don't overcrowd the pan. The temperature of the oil will drop when you add the chicken. Fry the pieces for 15 to 20 minutes at a temperature between 325° and 350°. If all the chicken does not fit in the pan at one time, start with the larger pieces, remove a few when cooked to drain on paper towels, and proceed to fry the smaller pieces. During the last two minutes of cooking time, add the thyme, sage, rosemary, and garlic and fry until crisp. Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Serve the chicken topped with the fried herbs and garlic.
