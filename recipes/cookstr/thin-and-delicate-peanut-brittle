Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 17 × 11-inch baking pan with parchment, aluminum foil, or a nonstick baking pad. Cook the caramel (see the Note on cooking caramel successfully): In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan combine the sugar, 1/3 cup water, and the cream of tartar. Cover and cook over high heat until the syrup comes to a very rapid boil. Remove the cover and continue to cook on medium-high heat until the sugar has turned a golden brown caramel color. Pour the caramel onto the prepared baking pan and let cool. Grind the caramel: When the caramel is cool, break it into 1-inch pieces. Place the pieces in a food processor or coffee grinder and grind to the consistency of granular sugar. Stir in the ground nuts. Bake and shape the brittle: Reline your baking sheet with parchment paper, aluminum foil, or a nonstick baking pad. Spread the caramel and nut mixture onto the baking sheet in an even layer, approximately 1/8 inch thick. Bake until the caramel melts and begins to bubble, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle the salt evenly over the melted caramel. When the brittle is cool, break it up into small pieces and serve.
