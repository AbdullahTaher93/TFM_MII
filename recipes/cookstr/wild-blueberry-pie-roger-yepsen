Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the oil, milk or yogurt, and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir in the flour to form a ball of dough, adding a little oil and milk or yogurt if necessary to keep the ball together. Separate the dough into two balls and place them in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. In another mixing bowl, combine the filling ingredients - the berries, sugar, lemon juice, and nutmeg. Dissolve the cornstarch in the 4 tablespoons of water and stir well into the other ingredients. Roll out the chilled dough into bottom and top crusts for an 8- or 9-inch pie pan. To prevent sticking, place the dough discs between sheets of wax paper. Roll from the center to the perimeter, turning them over a few times, so that the discs will be formed evenly. Peel off the paper. Place the bottom round in the ungreased pie pan and trim off the dough along the rim. Spoon in the filling and top it with pats of the butter. Put the top in place, pinching along the perimeter. To help the crust develop a good color, brush the 2 tablespoons of milk or yogurt over the top and sprinkle the tablespoon of sugar. Make a few cuts in the top to let the steam our. Bake initially at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 375 degrees and cook for another 35 minutes or until the crust shows good color.
