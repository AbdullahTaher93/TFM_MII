To make the salmon: Put the soy sauce, cilantro, ginger, and chile in a blender and purée until the mixture is blended, but still chunky. Transfer to a shallow bowl, submerge the salmon completely in the brine, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 20 hours. Remove the salmon from the brine and rinse thoroughly in cold water. Pat dry with paper towels and cut crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices. To make the sauce: Put the crème fraîche, scallions, cilantro, lime zest, and chile in a small mixing bowl and mix well. Stir in the lime juice and salt. Spoon a pool of the sauce onto each serving plate. Decoratively lay the salmon slices on top of the sauce and garnish with the Asian pear and lime zest. Serve immediately.
