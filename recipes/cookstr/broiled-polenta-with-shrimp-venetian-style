To make the polenta, bring 3 cups water to a boil with a good pinch of salt and slowly pour in the polenta. Mix with a whisk until it thickens, then stir periodically with a wooden spoon for 40 minutes over a gentle heat until cooked. Follow manufacturerâ€™s instructions if using instant. Pour onto a flat plate and leave to cool. Just before serving, heat a griddle. Cut the polenta into strips or triangles and lightly smear the pieces with olive oil. (You might not need to use all the polenta.) Cook on a high heat on both sides until the polenta lifts off easily. Keep warm. Cook the fava beans and peas separately in boiling water until tender. The pale outer skin of large fava beans can be quite tough, so remove it, revealing the darker inner bean. This will reduce the final quantity, so perhaps remove the skins for just half the beans or only the large ones. Set aside. Cook the onion in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil for 5 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and cooked fava beans and peas. Season with salt and pepper and mix briefly. Add the diced tomatoes and cook until they reduce into a thick sauce. Add the vermouth and cook a minute more. Add the basil, then transfer to a bowl. Rinse the pan, add the remaining olive oil and cook the shrimp on a medium-high heat for about 3-5 minutes on both sides, depending on their size, until golden brown. Add the bean mixture and mix briefly. Place the broiled polenta on serving plates with the shrimp mixture and serve right away.
