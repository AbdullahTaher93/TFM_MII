Combine all the ingredients in a 5-quart kettle or Dutch oven, cover with water by about 1Â½ inches, and bring slowly to a simmer over medium heat. Skim off the foam that rises to the top during the first 10 minutes with a large, flat spoon. Simmer the stock gently for 2 hours, skimming the fat and foam occasionally. If you want the final stock to be clear, make sure that the liquid never rises above a slow simmer. Strain the stock through a colander into a bowl and discard the solids. For a clear stock, strain again through a double thickness of slightly dampened cheesecloth. Refrigerate the stock until cold. Remove the layer of fat that rises to the top before using the stock or freezing it in smaller quantities.
