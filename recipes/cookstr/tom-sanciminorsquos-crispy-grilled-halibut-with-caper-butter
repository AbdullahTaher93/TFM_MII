Combine the red pepper, garlic salt, and sea salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle liberally over one side of each of the fillets and pat it in so it adheres. Light a charcoal fire or preheat your gas grill on high. Oil the grill’s cooking surface. You’re going to want to cook over a very hot fire. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the lemon juice and capers, and stir to combine. Keep warm. Place the halibut, seasoned side down, on the grill. Cook for about 4 minutes; turn and cook until just opaque in the center, about another 4 minutes. Transfer the fillets to a platter, pour over the caper butter sauce, and serve immediately.
