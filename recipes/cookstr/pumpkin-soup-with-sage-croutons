Now: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the carrot, onion, celery, bay leaf, and sage. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the pureed pumpkin, and add the broth, 1 cup at a time. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes more. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Puree the soup using an immersion blender, or puree it in batches in an upright blender or food processor. Allow the soup to cool. Transfer to an airtight container, and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Later: Return the soup to a large pot, and bring it to a boil on medium-high heat. Stir in enough of the broth to obtain your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. While the soup is heating, cut both slices of bread into 4- squares, and halve them on a diagonal to form triangles. Place the triangles on a baking sheet, and sprinkle them with the dried sage. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Top each serving of the soup with the sage croutons and a fresh sage leaf.
