Place the lentils, carrot, shallot, thyme, and bay leaf in a saucepan with 5 cups of water. Simmer for 15â€“20 minutes or until the lentils are tender. Drain the lentils well, transfer to a serving bowl, and remove the thyme and bay leaf. Cool until lukewarm. Add the olives, goat cheese, and olive oil, and stir together. Season with salt and pepper and serve warm. Variation: Dressed Lentils Leftovers are good served as a salad. Splash with balsamic vinegar, add extra olive oil, and sprinkle with lots of chopped parsley. If you wish, add sliced anchovy fillets.
