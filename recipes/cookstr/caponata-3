Preheat the oven to 300°F. In a large ovenproof saucepan or casserole, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat until shimmering. Sauté the garlic, onion, and red onion until the onions are transparent, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, thyme, and stock and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper and continue simmering. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil and sauté the carrots and bell pepper until just tender, 3 minutes. Season them with salt and pepper and add to the simmering tomato mixture. Add another 2 tablespoons of the oil, heat until smoking, and sauté the eggplant until just tender, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add to the simmering tomato mixture. In the same skillet you used for the eggplant, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat until shimmering. Add the zucchini and yellow squash and sauté until tender, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add to the simmering tomato mixture. Add the olives and capers and mix well. Cover and bake 1 hour. Add the vinegar, taste, and season with salt and pepper, if necessary.
