Rinse the chicken bones under cold running water to remove any blood, which would cloud the stock. Place the bones in a stockpot and add just enough cold water to cover by 2 inches, about 1 gallon. Place the pot over medium-low heat and slowly bring to a simmer, uncovered, skimming any foam and impurities that rise to the surface. Add the onions, celery, carrots, parsley, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns, and coriander. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for about 2 hours, skimming occasionally to keep the stock clear. Remove from the heat and pass through a fine-mesh strainer into a large container, discarding the solids. If not using the stock immediately, place the container in a sink full of ice water and stir frequently to cool the stock. When cold, remove any fat that has solidified on the surface. Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 1 month.
