In a mortar using a pestle or in a food processor, combine all the ingredients except the oil and water and pound or process until coarsely pureed. Add the oil and pound or process until a fairly smooth paste forms. Add the water 1 tablespoon at a time if the paste is too dry to process. Will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
