In a bowl, combine the lobster meat with the mayonnaise, lemon juice, celery, pepper, and tarragon, if using, and gently stir to combine. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight. When ready to eat, split the bun open, butter it lightly on the inside, and toast it in a toaster oven, then pile on the lobster salad.
