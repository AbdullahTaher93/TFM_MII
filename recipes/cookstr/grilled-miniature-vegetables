Prepare the grill. When the coals have reached a dusty red glow, grill the vegetables in the following manner: Thinly slice the larger eggplants up to the stem and fan out the slices. The smallest eggplants can be grilled whole. Halve the peppers and remove the stems, seeds, and veins. Cut a small slice off the stem and root ends of the garlic. Cut the bulb horizontally in half. Remove the silk but leave the baby corn in their husks. Brush all of the vegetables with olive oil and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the vegetables on the grill, browning on each side until tender.
