Season the veal with salt and pepper. Dredge in the flour and shake off any excess. Melt the butter with the oil in a large flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. Add the veal and cook, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes, or until browned all over. Transfer to a plate. Add the onion and garlic to the casserole and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until softened but not colored. Stir in the stock and tomato paste, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Return the veal to the casserole. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer for 1Â½ hours or until the veal is tender. Check the stew occasionally, and if the cooking liquid has reduced too much, add more stock. The finished cooking liquid should be quite thick. Stir the parsley, anchovies, and lemon zest into the casserole, Adjust the seasoning and serve immediately.
