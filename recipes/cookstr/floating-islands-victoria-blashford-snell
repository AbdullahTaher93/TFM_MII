To make the custard, dissolve the cornstarch in ¼ cup milk in a large saucepan. Add the remaining milk, the cream, and sugar and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring often. Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl and whisk in the hot milk mixture. Return to the saucepan and stir over medium heat, cooking just until the custard coats the back of a wooden spoon. Do not boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Strain the custard into a bowl. Top with a piece of plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface of the custard and pierce a few slits in the wrap. Let cool, then refrigerate at least 2 hours, until chilled. To make the meringues, bring the milk and 1¼ cups water to a boil in a large frying pan over high heat. Reduce the heat to very low so it is below a simmer. Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Gradually beat in the sugar until the peaks are stiff and glossy. Using two large soup spoons, shape ovals of the meringue and carefully transfer them to the hot milk mixture. Do not add more than 4 meringues at once, as they will expand. Cook for 1 minute, then turn and cook for 30 seconds more, just until set. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a clean kitchen towel to drain. Repeat with the remaining meringue. Let cool. Divide the custard among shallow bowls and top with the meringues. Grate the chocolate over each and serve immediately.
