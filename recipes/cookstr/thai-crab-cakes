Flake the crabmeat into a bowl, picking it over carefully to remove any small, sharp pieces of shell. Add the green beans, chile, fish sauce, chives, and lime leaves, and mix together. Add the egg white, stirring to bind the mixture. Dust your hands with flour and shape the mixture into 18 small balls. Flatten them slightly into cakes. Place on a floured baking sheet, spaced slightly apart so they don't stick together, and refrigerate for 1 hour or until firm. Preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C). Pour enough oil into a large, deep frying pan to come about 1 in (2.5cm) up the sides, and heat to 325°F (160°C). In batches, dredge the crab cakes in flour, shaking off the excess. Fry for about 3 minutes, until golden. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels, and keep warm in the oven. 3. Preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C).
