Combine the dried apricots with the rum in a small pot with a tight-fitting lid. Bring this to a boil, and simmer over low heat for 1 minute. Cover, and let the apricots cool in the covered pot. Place the pumpkin in a mixing bowl; whisk in the melted butter, sugar and spices; stir in the chopped nuts. When the apricots are cool, cut them into ½-inch pieces and stir them–and any remaining liquid in the pot–into the mousse. Chill. While the mousse is chilling, whip the heavy cream until it is very stiff. Fold most of it into the mousse, reserving some for decoration. Chill until ready to eat.* Just before serving, spoon the mousse into large wine goblets and pipe some whipped cream in the center of each mousse, with a pastry bag.
