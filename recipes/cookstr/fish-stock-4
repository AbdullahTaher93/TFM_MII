Cut away all traces of the liver and the gills from the bones and fish heads. If you have time, soak the bones and fish heads in ice water for at least 20 minutes to extract any remaining blood. In a large saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, mushrooms, and parsley and gently saut√© over medium heat until the onion is softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add the fish heads and bones, cover, and cook for 15 minutes. Add the wine, increase the heat to high, and reduce the liquid, uncovered, by half, about 3 minutes. Add the water, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Strain the stock and allow it to cool uncovered before refrigerating.
