Combine all of the ingredients for the stock in a large pot and add water to cover (8 to 10 cups). Bring the mixture to a boil. Skim off the foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat and gently simmer the stock, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours. Add cold water as necessary to keep the bones covered and skim the stock often to remove any fat or scum that collects on the surface. Do not let the stock boil, or it will become cloudy. Strain the stock through a strainer lined with several layers of cheesecloth into a large bowl, and let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate. Remove any fat that congeals on the surface. I like to freeze stock in 1-cup containers, so Iâ€™ll always have the right amount on hand.
