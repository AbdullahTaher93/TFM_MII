Spray a 5×9-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and coat with flour. Mix ½ cup flour, the whole wheat flour, oats, baking powder, nutmeg and salt. Combine the honey and butter in a large bowl and beat until fluffy. Add the vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the dry ingredients alternately with the banana, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the walnuts. Spoon into the prepared pan. Bake at 325 degrees for 50 to 55 minutes or until a wooden pick comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove to the wire rack to cool completely.
