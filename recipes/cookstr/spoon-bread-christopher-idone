Generously butter the souffle dish. Preheat the over to 350° F. In a heavy medium saucepan, scald the milk. Do not let it boil. Combine the cornmeal, salt and sugar, and slowly stir into the milk. Add the butter and stir constantly over moderate heat for 10 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the egg yolks and baking powder. Let cool. In a bowl, beat the egg whites with a dash of salt until they form soft peaks. Thoroughly blend about ½ cup of the egg whites into the cornmeal mixture to lighten it. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites, do not overblend. Pour the mixture into the buttered mold and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until golden.
