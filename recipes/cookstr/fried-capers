Drain the capers and put them on a paper towel to dry them as much as possible. In a small, deep saucepan, heat ½ inch olive oil until it shimmers (350°F on a frying or candy thermometer). Add the capers to the hot oil and fry for 1 to 2 minutes until they begin to crisp. Fry in batches if doing a lot; otherwise you’ll cool the oil down too much. Drain carefully and put on paper towels to absorb excess oil. The capers can be made 3 to 4 hours ahead; keep them uncovered at room temperature.
