In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the leeks, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the potato and 4 cups stock, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the potato is very soft, about 20 minutes. Add the sorrel and cook for a minute or so. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, ladle into warmed bowls, garnish with the chives, and serve hot. Or, after adding the sorrel and cooking for a minute or so, let the soup cool slightly and, working in batches if necessary, puree in a blender or food processor until smooth. If serving hot, pour the pureed soup into a clean pan and reheat until piping hot, adding stock if needed to achieve a good consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, ladle into warmed bowls, and garnish with the chives. To serve chilled, pour the pureed soup into a bowl, thin with a little stock if needed to achieve a good consistency, let cool completely, cover, and refrigerate until well chilled. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, ladle into chilled bowls, and garnish with the chives.
