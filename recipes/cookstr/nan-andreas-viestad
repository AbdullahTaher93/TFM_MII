In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Combine the yogurt and milk in a small pot and heat until the mixture reaches about 110 degrees F—no more than 120 degrees F, or you risk killing the yeast. Stir the yogurt mixture into the flour, then knead the dough for 1 to 2 minutes: let the dough rest for a couple or minutes, and repeat the kneading and resting two or three times, until the dough is smooth and soft. You may need a little more flour, but make sure not to “feed” it too much, or the nan will be hard and tough. Cover and allow to rise for about 1 hour. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, raisins, and 2 teaspoons cumin seeds and sauté for 10 minutes, or until the onions are brown, Season with more cumin to taste, if desired. Remove from the heat. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Knead the onion mixture into the dough (alternatively, divide and roll out the dough, divide the onion mixture among the dough rounds, and fold each one over into a half-moon shape), Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Using your hands or a rolling pin, pat or roll out the dough to flat rounds (they don’t have to be perfect rounds), Rub your hands and the rolling pin generously with oil as necessary to prevent sticking. Place 1 or 2 breads at a time directly on an oven rack and bake until puffed up and with some dark brown patches, about 3 to 5 minutes. Pay close attention so the breads do not burn. Variations: Nan with Spicy Ground Meat: Sauté ground meat, preferably lamb, with onions, chiles, cardamom, cinnamon, and turmeric. Divide the dough into 6 pieces, roll out, and fill and bake as directed, Nan with Dried Fruits: Sauté onions, mixed dried fruits, and cinnamon (to taste) in oil until the onions are soft and slightly caramelized. Divide the dough into 6 pieces, roll out, and fill and bake as directed, Nan with Sesame Seeds: Sprinkle the plain nan dough, or any of the other variations, with sesame seeds before baking.
