Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the smoked haddock in a baking dish with 3 tbsp water. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 15 minutes, until heated through. Uncover and let cool, then flake into pieces. Mix the flaked haddock, mashed potato, scallions, parsley, lemon zest and juice, and mustard together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture into 12 cakes. Place the flour in a small dish, the beaten egg in another, and the bread crumbs in a third dish. Roll each fishcake in the flour, then dip into the egg, and coat with the bread crumbs. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. In batches, add the cakes and cook about 5 minutes, turning once, until golden brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve hot.
