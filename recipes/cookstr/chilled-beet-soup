Trim the beets, leaving 2 inches of the stems and the roots ends attached to prevent bleeding. Reserve the leaves. Wash the beets and leaves thoroughly. Place the beets and leaves in a soup kettle and add the remaining soup ingredients. Pour in 1 quart of water. Bring a boil over high heat and reduce the heat to low. Simmer about 45 minutes or until the beets are tender and cooked through. Remove the beets and turn off the heat. Under cold running water, slip off the skins and stems. Cut the beets into fine julienne. Strain the broth, discarding the solids, and add the beet julienne to the soup. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Serve with a spoonful of sour cream with a little chopped dill and grated lemon zest.
