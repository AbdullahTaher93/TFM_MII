To make the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the leek, mushrooms, and celery and cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes, until softened. Remove from the heat and stir in the bread crumbs, egg, parsley, lemon juice, and ground coriander. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Oil a 13 × 9in (33 × 23cm) baking dish. Cook the cabbage leaves in boiling water for 2 minutes, until pliable. Drain and rinse under cold water. Pat dry. Lay each leaf flat and divide the stuffing among the leaves. Roll up each leaf, folding in the sides to enclose the filling in a neat parcel. Place the rolls, seam side down, in the dish. Pour in the stock. Bake for 45–55 minutes, until tender. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes, until softened. Stir in the crushed tomatoes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer about 10 minutes, or until lightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Using a slotted spoon, serve the cabbage rolls on dinner plates, with the remaining tomato sauce passed on the side. Variation: German Cabbage Rolls In place of the mushroom filling, mix together 9oz (250g) ground pork or beef, ½ cup fresh bread crumbs, and 1 egg; season with salt and pepper. Use to stuff the cabbage leaves, and tie up each roll with kitchen twine. Place in a single layer in a flameproof casserole. Add 4oz (115g) chopped bacon, lightly fried, and the tomato sauce, adding water if the sauce doesn't cover the rolls. Simmer, covered, over low heat for about 40 minutes until tender.
