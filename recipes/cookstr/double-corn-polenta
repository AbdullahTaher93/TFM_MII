To Make the Fresh Tomato Salsa: In a medium bowl, stir together all ingredients. Cover and let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour to allow flavors to blend, then cover and store in refrigerator until ready to use. Drain, if necessary, before using. Homemade salsa is best eaten the same day as prepared. To Make the Double Corn Polenta: Preheat oven to 350°F. In a bowl, combine melted butter, eggs, cheese, corn, cornmeal, 1 cup sour cream, sugar, salt, and chiles and mix well. Place in a lightly sprayed or oiled 7½-by-11¾-inch glass baking dish. Bake, uncovered, until firm, about 40 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake 5 minutes longer. Serve with salsa and additional sour cream.
