Scrub the potatoes and halve the large ones. Place the potatoes in a steamer and place the steamer in a pot. Add about an inch of water to the pot or as much water as you can without having the bottom of the steamer come in contact with the water. Place the pot over medium heat. When the water comes to a boil, cover the pot, reduce the heat a bit, and steam until the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile place the olive oil or butter in the bottom of a serving dish. Mince the chives, scallions, or parsley and add it to the dish. When the potatoes are tender, place them in the serving dish, halving or quartering them as you go. Toss the potatoes with olive oil and herb right in the bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Variations: • The more carefree way of cooking new potatoes is to boil them, but they won’t be as flavorful as steamed and they might be waterlogged if you boil them too long. Nevertheless, here’s how: After you scrub and halve the potatoes, place them in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring the water to a boil and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well and proceed as directed. • Substitute chopped basil or jarred roasted peppers for the chives and mix with olive oil (not butter).
