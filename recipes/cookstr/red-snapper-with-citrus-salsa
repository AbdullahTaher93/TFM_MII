Prepare the salsa: Cut a thin slice off the top and bottom of the grapefruit and the oranges. With the fruit standing on a flat end, carefully slice off the remaining peel, from top to bottom, taking as much of the white pith as possible. Carefully slice between the membranes to section the fruit. Place the sections and any juice in a bowl, and then squeeze the grapefruit and orange halves over the bowl to extract any remaining juice. Fold in the remaining salsa ingredients; Set it aside. Position a rack 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Lightly oil a broiler pan with vegetable oil. Place the fish, flesh side up, in the broiler pan, and brush the fillets with the olive oil. Drizzle the lime juice over them, and season with salt and pepper. Broil until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily when tested with a fork, 7 to 8 minutes. Place a snapper fillet in the center of each dinner plate, and spoon the salsa over them. Garnish each portion with a basil sprig, and serve immediately.
