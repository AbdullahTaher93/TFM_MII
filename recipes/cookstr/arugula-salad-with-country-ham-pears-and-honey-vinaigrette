Sprinkle the walnuts around a dry skillet set over medium-low heat, Leave them alone a couple minutes, then stir well and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, just until splotchy brown and fragrant. Pour them out onto a cutting board, cool for a few minutes, then chop into little bits. Mix the arugula, ham, and pear pieces in a large bowl. Whisk the lemon juice, vinegar, honey, and mustard in a small bowl, then whisk in the oil in a slow, steady stream until youâ€™ve got a creamy, somewhat thick dressing. Pour the dressing over the arugula mixture, then sprinkle the toasted walnut pieces on top.
