Place the mixing bowl and wire whip attachment from a standing mixer in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes to chill. Sift the confectionersâ€™ sugar to remove any lumps. Combine all of the ingredients in the chilled bowl and whip on medium to medium-high speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until medium peaks form. Remove the bowl and lightly whip by hand with a whisk to the desired stiffness.
