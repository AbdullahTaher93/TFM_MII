Peel the oranges and two of the lemons, and cut the peel into very thin slices. Seed the oranges and cut up the pulp. Save the pulp of the two lemons for another use. Put the fruit and water in a pot. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand overnight in a cool place. Measure the fruit and liquid and, depending on your taste, add about ½ cup sugar for each cup fruit (you must add enough sugar to make the jam jell). Stir the sugar into the fruit and put the pot back on the stove over medium heat. Stirring often, let the jam cook about 30 minutes. Test for jell point by spooning a little jam onto a saucer and placing it in the refrigerator or freezer for a minute or two. If the jam jells it is ready to put into jars. I use the last lemon at this point. Peel the remaining lemon and slice the zest into very thin slices. Cut the pith away from the lemon and discard. Chop the lemon pulp into small pieces, remove any seeds, and add it and the zest to the jam. Pour into three 8-ounce jars. If you seal the jars with paraffin, do so as follows. Leave ½ inch head space in the jar. Pour one thin layer of paraffin over the hot jam. Let this layer set until it is firm, and then pour on one more thin layer.
