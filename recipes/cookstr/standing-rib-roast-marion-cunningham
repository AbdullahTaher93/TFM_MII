Preheat the oven to 325°F. Place the meat, fat side up, in a shallow open pan and allow it to come to room temperature. Roast for approximately 20 minutes to the pound. Insert a meat thermometer toward the end of the estimated cooking time: the meat is rare at 130°F, medium at 140°F, and well done at 160°F. Remove from the oven when the thermometer registers 5 degrees lower than the desired temperature, and let the roast sit on a carving board while the Yorkshire pudding bakes, if you are making it, and while you make a simple gravy: the roast will continue to cook and become easier to carve. Drain off most of the fat and place the roasting pan over a burner. Add the broth or simply ¼ cup water, and stir and scrape with a large kitchen spoon, loosening the brown glaze on the bottom of the pan. Add more liquid if you wish and salt and pepper to taste, and cook over low heat until well blended, about 2 minutes. Spoon over slices of carved beef. Rolled Rib Roast. Place meat in a V-shaped rack and increase cooking time to approximately 30 minutes to the pound. Allow 1/3 pound per serving.
