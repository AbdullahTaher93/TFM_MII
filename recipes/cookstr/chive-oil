Combine 2 quarts water and the salt in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the chives and blanch 15 seconds, or until they turn bright green and wilt; use a skimmer or slotted spoon to retrieve the chives, then plunge them into a bowl of ice water. Drain the chives, wrap in a kitchen towel, and gently squeeze out as much water as possible. Place in a blender with the oil and blend until smooth. Strain through a chinois or fine strainer.
