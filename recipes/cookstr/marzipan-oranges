Mix the marzipan and food coloring in a bowl until combined. For each orange, roll 1 oz (25g) of the mixture into a ball. Roll the ball over the coarse, star-shaped side of a box grater. Push a clove into the top. Use the blunt edge of a knife to make crease marks around the clove. Variations: Pear Marzipan Fruits: Color the marzipan pale green. Form into pear shapes. Push cloves into the bottoms and stand on end. Color a small amount of marzipan brown and use to create stalks. Banana Marzipan Fruits: Color the marzipan yellow. Form into sausage shapes with tapered ends. Bend toward you, then flatten the sides slightly with the back of a knife. Use thinned down brown food coloring to paint in a few streaks.
