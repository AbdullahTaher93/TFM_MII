Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter a 9 × 5in (23 × 13cm) loaf pan and line the bottom with wax paper. To make the cake, beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer until pale and creamy. Beat in the honey. One at a time, beat in the eggs, beating well after each addition. Add a little flour if the mixture begins to curdle. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and cinnamon. Stir into the butter mixture. Spread in the pan and smooth the top. Bake for 50–60 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the loaf is browning too quickly, tent with foil. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert and unmold onto the rack, peel off the paper, and let cool. To make the icing, mix the confectioner's sugar and honey, then stir in enough hot water to make a fluid icing. Drizzle the icing over the cake, letting it drip down the sides.
