In a medium sauté pan or skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the carrot, celery, onion, shallot, minced garlic, chiles, and anchovies and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is beginning to soften but not brown, about 6 minutes. Pour in the wine and bring to a boil; cook until the wine is reduced by half, then scrape the vegetable mixture into a 4- quart slow cooker. Stir in the stock, tomatoes, and tomato paste, and add the bay leaf and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Cook, covered, on the low setting for 3 to 4 hours, until the carrot and celery are soft. Stir in the parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper as necessary. Arrange the fish and shellfish over the tomato stew (put squid and octopus [if using] in first, then whole fish and fillets, then crab legs and shellfish), turn the cooker to the high setting, and cook, covered, without lifting the lid, for 30 minutes, or until the shellfish shells open (discard any clams or mussels that do not open after 30 minutes) and the fish flakes easily with a fork. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F. Slice the baguette into 3-inch lengths and split each in half horizontally. Brush the cut sides with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and rub with the cut sides of the halved garlic clove. Bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and crisp. Ladle the stew into shallow bowls and serve with the toasted baguette on the side.
