Combine the stuffing ingredients and set aside. Trim the excess fat from the pork chops. With a small sharp knife, make a horizontal slit through the fat side of each chop, cutting through the meat almost to the bone to make a pocket. Divide the stuffing evenly among the chops, tucking it firmly into the pockets. Secure with wooden toothpicks. Preheat the broiler. Place the pork chops on a baking sheet, brush with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Broil for 6–8 minutes on each side, depending on thickness, or until golden brown and the juices run clear. Remove the toothpicks and serve. 4. Preheat the broiler. Place the pork chops on a baking sheet, brush with oil, and season with salt and pepper.
