Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter an 8-by-8-inch baking pan and set aside. Combine the cookie crumbs with the brown sugar and nutmeg. Scatter about one-third of the crumb mixture on bottom of baking pan. Place half the pears on top of that; sprinkle half the Cognac on pears, and dot with half the butter. Repeat with half the remaining crumbs and all the remaining ingredients, in above order. Cover with the remaining crumbs. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pears are tender. Serve with a spoonful of sour cream for each person.
