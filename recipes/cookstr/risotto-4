In a heavy saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook onion and leek, covered, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in rice and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes Stir in bay leaf, wine (if using), salt, pepper and saffron Gradually stir in chicken stock, Â½ cup (125 mL) at a time, stirring until all the stock is absorbed before adding more. Risotto is done when mixture is creamy and rice is just tender but slightly firm in the center. (Total cooking time will be 15 to 20 minutes.) Discard bay leaf and stir in calcium greens, almonds and lemon zest. Spoon into serving bowls and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if tolerated.
