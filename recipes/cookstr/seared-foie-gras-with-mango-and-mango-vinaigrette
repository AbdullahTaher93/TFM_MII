The vinaigrette: The vinaigrette: Place all of the ingredients except the water in a blender and puree on high speed until smooth. If the puree seems too thick, thin it with a few drops of water and puree to incorporate. Keep adding water (a few drops at a time) until the puree has a sauce like consistency. Adjust the seasoning if needed. It should be both sweet and slightly tart.Reserve and serve at room temperature. The Foie Gras: The Foie Gras: Remove the foie gras from the refrigerator and cut into four 1½-inch-thick slices (they should weigh about 3 ounces each). Set aside at room temperature for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the diced mango, shallot, thyme, sugar, rice wine vinegar, olive oil, chives, and salt and pepper in a small mixing bowl. Toss gently and reserve. Place hazelnuts in a small sauté pan and toast over high heat until lightly browned and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crush the hazelnuts using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. (Or place them on a cutting board, cover them with the bottom of a saucepan, and crush them by pressing down firmly.) Season the foie gras with salt and pepper. Place two pieces of foie gras in each of two unheated sauté pans. Set the sauté pans on the stovetop over high heat and cook the foie gras until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour off any excess fat given off by the foie gras, gently flip each piece, and reduce heat to medium. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, remove from heat, and let foie gras pieces remain in pans for another minute. Transfer the foie gras to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb some of the excess fat. Place 1 spoonful of the mango salad in the center of four dinner plates. Arrange one piece foie gras on the top of each salad. Spoon Mango Vinaigrette in a circle around the salad and drizzle a bit over the foie gras. Garnish with crushed toasted hazelnuts, and serve.
