Place the mustard seeds in a spice mill or coffee grinder and process until finely ground. Combine the mustard and vinegar in a bowl and stir to mix. Allow the mixture to sit for 15 minutes. Place all of the ingredients in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Spoon the mustard into a sterilized jar, cover, and refrigerate for 1 week before using. Mustard will keep in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 6 months after opening.
