In a medium bowl, sift together the sweet rice flour and salt. Add Â½ cup hot water, a spoonful at a time, stirring constantly until the mixture has the consistency of cornmeal. Dust your hands with a little bit of rice flour and knead the mixture into a soft dough. Divide the dough into 24 little balls. In a large stockpot, bring about 1 gallon of water to a boil. Drop the balls into the boiling water, one at a time, and cook for about 7 minutes. The balls will float to the top and become slightly translucent. While the balls are boiling, prepare a cooling bath by adding ice to a medium bowl of water. As the balls are cooked, place them in the ice water to stop cooking. Serve coated or add to soups and porridges.
