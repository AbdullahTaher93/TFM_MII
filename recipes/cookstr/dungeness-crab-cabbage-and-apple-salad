Place 4 endive leaves arranged in a square in the center of each plate. In a medium bowl, combine the cabbage, apple, and pistachios and toss with a couple of tablespoons of the Walnut Oil Vinaigrette. Mound in the center of each endive square. Toss the crabmeat with a bit of the vinaigrette and put on top of the cabbage along with a claw-meat portion on top. Drizzle a bit more vinaigrette over all and top with a teaspoon of the caviar and a few sprouts.
