Preheat the oven 425Â° F. Beat the eggs, milk, and butter together in a bowl until smooth. Stir together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, the chipotle paste, and cumin in another bowl to combine well. Pour the egg-milk-butter mixture into this mixture, stirring to incorporate and avoid lumps. Pour the batter into the wells of a nonstick 15-muffin tin, filling each well three-quarters of the way up its side. Bake the muffins until they rise and are golden brown, about 35 minutes. Transfer the muffins to a linen napkin-lined basket and serve warm from the oven.
