Prepare ahead Boil the potatoes in lightly salted water about 20 minutes, until tender. Drain and mash with the butter and nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper. Stir over low heat about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Beat in the egg yolks. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a ½ in (1cm) plain tip. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Bring the scallops, 2/3 cup water, the wine, celery, thyme, peppercorns, bay leaf, and a large pinch of salt to a boil over low heat. Cover and simmer for 1-2 minutes, just until the scallops look opaque on the outside. Strain over a bowl and reserve the cooking liquid. Simmer the mushrooms and lemon juice in a small covered saucepan over medium-low heat about 5 minutes, or until tender. Season with salt and pepper. Uncover and boil over high heat until the liquid is evaporated. Add to the scallops. To make the sauce, melt 1 tbsp of the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Whisk in the reserved liquid and whisk until simmering and thickened. Simmer, whisking often, until slightly reduced. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream and ¼ cup of the Gruyére. Cut each scallop into 2 or 3 pieces and stir into the sauce with the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture into each shell or ramekin and sprinkle the remaining Gruyére on top. Pipe a generous border of potato around the edges of each shell. Dot with the remaining butter. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until golden. Serve hot.
