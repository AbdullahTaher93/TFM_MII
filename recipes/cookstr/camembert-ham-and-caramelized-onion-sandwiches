Put the currants and hot water in a small heat-proof bowl. Let sit for at least 15 minutes or as long as 1 hour, then drain. Set aside. In a medium-size saut√© pan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, or until soft. Add the vinegar, currants, salt, and pepper to taste and cook for 10 more minutes. Let cool. To assemble: place a few onions and some currants on the bottom half of the bread. Top with the ham, cheese, and other bread half. Serve right away.
