Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter the bottom and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans. Line the bottoms with rounds of wax or parchment paper, and butter the paper. Dust the bottoms and sides of the pans with flour, tapping out any excess. Set the pans aside. Prepare the cake: Using an electric mixer, cream the butter until it is pale yellow, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and mix until just blended. Add’ the orange zest and juice. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans. Bake until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 minutes. Allow the cake layers to cool in the pans on a wire rack for about 20 minutes. Then invert the layers onto the wire rack, carefully peel off the wax paper, and let them cool completely. (The cake layers can be baked 1 day ahead. Wrap them in aluminum foil and refrigerate them.] About 4 hours before serving, prepare the filling: Set aside the 12 best strawberries for garnish. Quarter the remaining strawberries and toss them in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours for the juices to form. About 2 hours before serving, combine the cream, vanilla, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in a bowl, and whip until it holds soft peaks. Place a cake layer, right side up (level it off with serrated knife if it is uneven), on a pedestal cake stand. Spoon half of the quartered strawberries over the cake. Spread half of the whipped cream over the strawberries. Cover with the remaining cake layer. Spoon the remaining quartered strawberries over the cake, and then cover with the remaining whipped cream. Arrange the whole berries decoratively on top. Serve the cake immediately, or keep it in the refrigerator for up to 4 hours before serving. It’s best eaten right away.
