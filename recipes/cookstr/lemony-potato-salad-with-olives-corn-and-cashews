Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes, reduce the heat, and simmer the potatoes for 12 to 15 minutes, or until just tender. Don’t overcook; the potatoes should be firm but cooked through. Drain the potatoes in cold water and when cool enough to handle, cut into quarters. In a large bowl, put the quartered potatoes and gently mix in the com, olives, cashews, and parsley along with the Lemon Dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Don’t overmix or the potatoes will break apart. Can be made a day ahead and stored covered in the refrigerator. Best served at room temperature. For the Dressing: In a medium, nonreactive bowl, combine the lemon zest, lemon juice, mustard, tarragon, and green onions and whisk thoroughly. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking. Season with the red pepper flakes and salt to taste.
