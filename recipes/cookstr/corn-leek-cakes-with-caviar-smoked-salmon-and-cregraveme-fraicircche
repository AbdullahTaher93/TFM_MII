Place the corn kernels in a food processor and pulse just until coarsely chopped. Set aside. In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt ¼ cup of the butter. Pour off 2 tablespoons and reserve. Add the leeks to the skillet and sauté until softened, about 10 minutes. Set aside. In a blender, combine the half-and-half, eggs, reserved melted butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Blend until mixed. Add the cornmeal and flour and blend until a smooth batter forms. Add the coarsely chopped corn and sautéed leeks and blend just until mixed. Melt the remaining ¼ cup butter in a large nonstick skillet or on a griddle over medium heat. Using a small ladle or measuring cup with a pouring spout, pour about 1 tablespoon of the batter into the skillet for each cake. Do not crowd the pan. Cook until the cakes bubble and are just set, about 2 minutes. Then flip the cakes and cook for another minute. Turn out onto a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to absorb any excess oil. Keep warm. Repeat until all are cooked. To serve, place the cakes on a large serving platter and garnish each with a dollop of crème fraîche, caviar, a small piece of salmon, and a small sprig of watercress or dill. Serve immediately
