Preheat oven to 375 degrees. With 1 tablespoon of butter, lightly grease an 8-inch pie plate. Brown the bacon in a 10-inch skillet. While the bacon is browning, wash and slice the leeks into ½-inch rounds. When the bacon is brown, remove most of the bacon fat, then add the leeks and water to the skillet. Cover and simmer, over low heat, for 20 minutes, or until the leeks are tender and have absorbed the water. Evaporate any remaining water over medium heat, uncovered. Be sure to stir the leeks every now and then as they cook, to be sure they do not burn. Remove the leeks and bacon to the bowl of a food processor or blender. Add the eggs, cream, nutmeg, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Process or blend for a few seconds until the bacon is chopped up. (Do not overdo this step or you will end up with baby food.) Pour this mixture into the prepared pie plate. Sprinkle grated cheese and pieces of the remaining tablespoon of butter on top. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the custard has set. Serve warm or tepid.
