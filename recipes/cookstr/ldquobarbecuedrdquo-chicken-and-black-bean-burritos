If the chicken is frozen, run it under hot water so you can remove the packaging. Place the chicken on a microwave-safe plate and microwave, uncovered, on high power for 3 minutes to partially defrost. Meanwhile, peel and dice the onion and set it aside. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. While the oil is heating, cut the chicken (fresh or partially defrosted) into bite-size pieces, adding them to the pan as you cut. When all of the chicken has been added, cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and onion to the skillet. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes more. Meanwhile, rinse and drain the beans. When the chicken is cooked through, add the beans and barbecue sauce to the skillet and stir well to coat the chicken with the sauce. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the mixture and continue to cook, without stirring, until the cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, stack the tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and microwave until warm, following the package directions, 3 to 5 minutes. To serve, spoon some of the chicken mixture onto the center of each tortilla and add a dollop of sour cream, if desired. Tuck in one end and roll up the tortillas burrito-style. You can use 2 cups Perfect Poached Chicken, Poached Chicken Thighs, or Great Grilled Chicken Breasts, defrosted if frozen. Add in Step 6. Or use 2 cups Chunky Seasoned Chicken, defrosted if frozen. Omit the onion, oil, and garlic. Begin the recipe at Step 5, adding the Chunky Seasoned Chicken with the beans and barbecue sauce in Step 6; cook until heated through.
