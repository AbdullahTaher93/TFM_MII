Preheat oven to 375° (190°C) Fruit Layer: In baking dish, stir together rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, ginger and flour. Set aside. Topping: In a food processor, combine flour, 2 tbsp (25 ml) sugar, baking powder and salt; process until combined. Add butter; process until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add sour cream; process until a soft sticky dough forms. Drop dough in 6 spoonfuls evenly over fruit in baking dish (Fruit will not be completely covered.) Sprinkle evenly with remaining sugar. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until topping has risen and is golden brown, and fruit is bubbly. Serve warm with Ginger Crème Fraîche. Ginger Crème Fraîche: Place a medium bowl and the beaters of electric mixer in the freezer; chill for 15 minutes. Pour whipping cream into chilled bowl; beat with electric mixer at high speed until soft peaks just start to form (cream should still be slightly runny). With a large spoon or rubber spatula and using a gentle, cutting motion, fold in sour cream and ginger syrup until well combined. Refrigerate until ready to serve. To freeze: When cobbler has cooled, wrap baking dish with heavy foil. Transfer cooled sauce to freezer container. Date, label and freeze for up to 2 months. To serve: Thaw cobbler and sauce in refrigerator overnight. In a saucepan, gently warm Ginger Crème Fraîche before serving. From Julia Aitken: Easy Entertaining
