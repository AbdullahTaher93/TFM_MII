Place all the peppercorns in a clean towel, wrap the towel around them, and pound them with a hammer to coarsely crush. Gently press the mixture into both sides of the skirt steak. Combine all the ingredients for the marinade in a bowl and stir to mix. Place the steak in a nonreactive dish or heavy, resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over it. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight. Heat the grill to hot, brush the onions with vegetable oil, and grill until soft. Grill the steak over a hot fire until medium-rare, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the steak from the grill and slice thinly against the grain. Quickly heat each tortilla on the grill. Serve the steak wrapped in a tortilla and topped with a grilled onion, with bowls of the condiments on the side.
