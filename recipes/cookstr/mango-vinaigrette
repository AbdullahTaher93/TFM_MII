Place all of the ingredients except the water in a blender and puree on high speed until smooth. If the puree seems too thick, thin it with a few drops of water and puree to incorporate. Keep adding water (a few drops at a time) until the puree has a sauce like consistency. Adjust the seasoning if needed. It should be both sweet and slightly tart. Reserve and serve at room temperature.
