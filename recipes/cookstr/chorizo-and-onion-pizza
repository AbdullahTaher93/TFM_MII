Make the dough: In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the sugar and 1 cup warm water. In a large mixing bowl, stir together 2½ cups of the flour and the salt. When the yeast begins to foam, make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of the oil. With a your hands or a wooden spatula, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Knead the mixture, gradually adding more flour, if needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into 4 to 6 equal portions. Generously oil 4 to 6 metal pie pans, 8 to 9 inches in diameter. Roll out the portions of dough into rounds about ¼ inch thick and large enough to line the bottoms of the pans. Place the dough rounds in the pans and cover the pans with clean kitchen towels. Set aside in a warm, draft-free area to rise for 30 to 40 minutes. Top the pizzas: Preheat the oven to 425°F. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce on each dough round. Add a layer of chorizo and a layer of onion. Top with 2 to 3 more tablespoons of tomato sauce and about ½ cup of the cheese. Bake the pizzas on the middle shelves of the oven until the crust is golden brown and the topping is hot and bubbling, about 15 minutes.
