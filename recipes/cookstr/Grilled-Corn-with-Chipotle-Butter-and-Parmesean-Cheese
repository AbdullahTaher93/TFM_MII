Preheat a barbecue grill to high heat. While the grill is heating, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ears of corn and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the corn and dry with a towel. Set aside. Stir the butter and the chile powder together in a small bowl, and set it aside. Oil the grill grate well, and spread the olive oil over the ears of corn. Arrange the corn on the grate and grill, turning the ears, until they have nice grill marks, about 3 minutes. Transfer the ears of corn to a plate, and brush the chipotle butter over them. Sprinkle on the Parmesan cheese, and serve immediately.
