Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Using kitchen twine, tie the chicken drumsticks together. Tie twine across the breast to secure the wings down. Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole over medium heat. Add the chicken and brown on all sides. Transfer to a plate. Sprinkle flour into the casserole and stir for 2 minutes over low heat until barely browned. Stir in the cider and stock, and bring to a boil. Return the chicken to the casserole, breast-side up. Add the bouquet garni and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and bake for 1¼ hours. Add the carrots, potatoes, and leeks. Return to the oven and bake for about 40 minutes more, or until the juices run clear when pierced. Transfer the chicken to a carving board. Let stand for 10 minutes. Discard the bouquet garni. Carve the chicken, return to the pot, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve hot. 2. Return the chicken to the casserole, breast-side up. Add the bouquet garni and salt and pepper to taste.
