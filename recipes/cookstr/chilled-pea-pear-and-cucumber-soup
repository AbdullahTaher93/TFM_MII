Melt the butter in a roomy pan and add the onion. Allow to stew quietly for 5 minutes or so and then add the cucumber. Stir in and cook both until limp and tender. Tip in the peas and stock and bring to a boil. Skim off any resultant scum that forms on the surface, season, and simmer for 20 minutes. Puree with the pears in a blender and then pass through a sieve into a bowl. Allow to cool to room temperature and then stir in the cream. Adjust the seasoning once more if necessary and place in the fridge, covered, until really cold; there is nothing worse than a tepid cold soup. Ladle into chilled soup bowls and sprinkle with mint.
