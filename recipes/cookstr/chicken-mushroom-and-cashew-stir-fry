In a large bowl, whisk together hoisin sauce, soy sauce, water, and cornstarch. Add chicken, toss to coat, and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. In a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, warm 2 tablespoons oil. When oil is hot, add garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Remove garlic and ginger and discard. Remove chicken from marinade with a slotted spoon and add to wok. Reserve marinade. Stir-fry until chicken turns white, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the wok. When oil is hot, add mushrooms, bell pepper, and green onions and stir-fry until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to wok along with the reserved marinade and stir-fry until heated through and sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cashews and serve immediately with noodles.
