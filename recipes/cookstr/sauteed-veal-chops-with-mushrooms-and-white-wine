Wash the fresh mushrooms rapidly under cold running water, then cut them into very thin slices. When the dried mushrooms have finished soaking, lift them out of the water with your hand or a slotted spoon. Line a strainer with a paper towel and filter the water the mushrooms soaked in by pouring it through the strainer into a bowl or beaker. Set it aside. Wash the porcini mushrooms in several changes of cold water until they are free of all grit, then cut them up into large pieces. Set aside. Put the butter and sage in a saut√© pan and turn on the heat to medium high. When the butter is hot, slip in as many chops at one time as will fit without overlapping. Brown them well on one side, then turn them and brown the other side. Continue to cook them, turning them once or twice more, for 3 to 4 minutes, until the meat is done. It should be pink and moist, but not raw. Add the wine, let it bubble for about half a minute, then transfer the chops to a platter, using a slotted spoon or spatula. Continue to let the wine bubble until it has evaporated completely, scraping the bottom of the pan meantime with a wooden spoon to loosen any browning residues. When the wine has evaporated, add the reconstituted dried mushrooms and their filtered liquid to the pan. Stir from time to time as the liquid evaporates. When all the liquid has boiled away, add the sliced fresh mushrooms and the chopped parsley. Stir well, add salt and several grindings of pepper, stir again, then lower the heat to medium and cover the pan. As the fresh mushrooms cook they will shed liquid. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has evaporated. Add the heavy cream, leave the pan uncovered, and cook the cream down until it is more creamy than runny. Sprinkle the chops on both sides with a little salt and ground pepper and return them to the pan. Keep them in the pan just long enough to heat them through and through, turning them once or twice. Serve promptly when they are done.
