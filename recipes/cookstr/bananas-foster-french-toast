Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the milk, eggs, and sugar. Soak each slice of brioche in the mixture, making sure the entire surface is submerged. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok over medium-high heat, swirling it to evenly coat the cooking surface. Lay as many slices of bread in the wok as will fit. Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the slices and fry on the other side until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the French toast to a baking sheet and place in the preheated oven to keep warm as you fry the remaining bread. Wipe the wok with a paper towel to remove any bread crumbs (careful-it way still be quite warm). Combine the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and rum in the wok, and heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves and the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Add the bananas and stir until well coated with the sauce. To serve, place 2 slices of French toast on each plate and spoon the warm sauce over it; if you want to gild the lily, top with vanilla ice cream.
