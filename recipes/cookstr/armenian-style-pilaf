Place the rice in a large bowl and add cold water to cover. Swish the rice around; drain. Repeat two more times or until the water is clear. Drain in a strainer and let stand until ready to cook. Melt the butter in a large wide saucepan or deep skillet over medium-low heat. Add the vermicelli; cook, stirring, until the pasta is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the broth to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Add the rice and currants to the pasta; stir to blend. Add the hot broth and salt to taste. Heat to a boil; stir once. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until the broth is absorbed and the rice is tender, 15 minutes. Let stand, covered, off the heat for 10 minutes before serving.
