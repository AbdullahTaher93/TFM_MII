Heat the oil and half the butter in a small frying pan, add the squash, and fry gently for a few minutes, until it begins to take on a hint of color. Add the garlic and sage, season with salt and pepper, and sizzle gently until the garlic just begins to color. Immediately add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water to stop the garlic browning any more. Partly cover the pan with a lid and let the squash finish cooking in the steam from the water; it should be completely tender within about 10 minutes. Add a little more water if the pan becomes dry. Add the squash and any liquid to a blender or food processor, along with the rest of the butter, and blend until smooth. If it doesn’t quite come together, add a dash of hot water to make a thick, creamy purée. Taste and adjust the seasoning, then serve right away.
