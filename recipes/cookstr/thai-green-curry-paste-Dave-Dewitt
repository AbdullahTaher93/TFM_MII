Heat a heavy skillet over high heat, add the coriander, cumin, and peppercorns, and dry-roast until the seeds darken and become fragrant, being careful that they donâ€™t burn. Allow the ingredients to cool completely, place them in a spice mill or coffee grinder, and process to a fine powder. Trim the stalks of the lemongrass to about 3 inches in length. Trim away any hard portions, discard the outer leaves, and coarsely chop. Place all the ingredients, except the oil, in a blender or food processor and, with the motor running, slowly add just enough of the oil to form a paste. Refrigerate for up to 1 month or freeze for 4 months.
