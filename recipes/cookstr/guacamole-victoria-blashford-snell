Pit and skin the avocados. Place the flesh in a medium bowl and combine with a fork or potato masher until the mixture is mashed but somewhat chunky. Add the lime juice then the onion, tomato, and chiles. Mix well, then stir in the cilantro. Season with salt to taste. Fold in the sour cream, if using. Mound the guacamole into a serving bowl, garnish with cilantro sprigs, and serve immediately. If you cannot serve the guacamole immediately, cover it with plastic wrap, pressing it directly on the surface of the guacamole.
