For the marinated goat cheese: In a small bowl, combine the olive oil and seasonings. Place the cheese rounds in a small pan, cover with the herbed oil, and refrigerate at least 2 days. For the lentils: Place the lentils in a medium saucepan and add the water, a pinch of salt, and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain the lentils, removing the bay leaf, and while still warm, toss lightly with the vinaigrette. Add the onion and chives and combine. To serve: Toss the greens with just enough vinaigrette to moisten and divide among 4 plates. Arrange about 3 heaping tablespoons of lentils around the greens. Place the warm goat cheese over the greens and garnish with the chives.
