Sprinkle beef or veal cubes with salt and pepper. Heat fat in a 2-quart stew pot and brown seasoned meat in it. Add diced onion and continue cooking over low heat until onion is soft and golden. Add paprika and saut√© three or four minutes. Sprinkle with flour and stir until flour is absorbed. Add canned tomatoes with their liquid, and hot water or beef stock.
