Scrub the beets and peel thinly. Cut into vertical quarters or eighths, depending on the size of the beets. The pieces should be about 1 to 1 Â½ inches wide at the widest point. Place in a thoroughly cleaned crock and pour in enough cold water to come within 2 inches of the top rim. Cover partially, setting the lid somewhat askew, then lay several layers of cheesecloth over the lid to keep dust out. Keep at room temperature for 1 week. Skim off all scum on the surface. Stir well and skim again if more scum rises. By this time the liquid should begin to take on a faint pink color, and it will probably be cloudy. Again, partially cover with a lid that in turn is covered with cheesecloth. Let stand in a cool but not cold corner for 2 to 3 weeks. The Russell is done when it is a clear, deep ruby-red color. Refrigerate until ready to use. It will keep for several weeks. Use for borscht as indicated, or as a coloring and flavoring for grated horseradish when needed.
