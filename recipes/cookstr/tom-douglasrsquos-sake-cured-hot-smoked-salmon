The day before you plan to barbecue, prepare the salmon. Whisk together the marinade ingredients with ½ cup water, mixing until the sugar dissolves. Place the salmon in a nonreactive container and pour the marinade over it. Cover and refrigerate at least 12 hours, turning occasionally if needed to totally submerge the fish. Remove the salmon pieces from the marinade (reserving about ¼ cup of it) and place the fish on a rack sprayed with oil set over a baking sheet. Refrigerate, uncovered, for the glaze to set, about 2 hours. Refrigerate the reserved marinade also. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 180°F to 200°F. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes. Arrange a sage leaf on top of each piece of salmon and brush with the reserved marinade. 5. Transfer the salmon to the smoker, and smoke until just cooked through and flaky, about 20 to 25 minutes. Serve the salmon pieces hot or chilled, one per guest. Serving Suggestion Serving Suggestion
