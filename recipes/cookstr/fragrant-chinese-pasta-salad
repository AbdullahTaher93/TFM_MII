Heat 2-3 inches of oil in a 3- or 4-quart saucepan. Deep-fry the gluten slices until they are golden and crispy. Transfer the slices to a colander and rinse with 4 cups of boiling water to remove any excess oil. Squeeze the slices firmly, then cut them into ¼-inch strips. Set aside. Next, prepare the dressing. Using a fork or spoon, mix the water and miso together in a small saucepan until smooth. Add the remaining dressing ingredients and combine well. Heat over medium heat. Just before the mixture begins to boil, remove the pan from the heat. Remove and discard the woody stem from each shiitake mushroom and cut the caps into 1/8-inch slices. (If using the dried variety, you must first reconstitute them. Simply soak the mushrooms in ½ cup warm water for about 20 minutes.) Set the slices aside. Plunge the greens into the remaining boiling water for 3 minutes, then into cold water. Drain and squeeze the greens to remove excess water, then set aside. Boil the rice noodles until they are just tender. Drain them immediately, then rinse briefly with cold water. To make the Seasoning Broth, combine the water, soy sauce, and ginger slices in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the seitan and mushrooms, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently for even coating. Continue to simmer until no liquid remains. Remove the ginger slices. Add the seitan-mushroom mixture to the noodles. Also add the cooked greens, bell pepper, and dressing. Lightly toss and serve.
