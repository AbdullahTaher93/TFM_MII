Ask the fishmonger or use a sharp paring knife to fold back the soft carapace and trim the head of the crabs. Remove the gills. Trim the apron from the underside of the crab. Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet and saut√© the crabs for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Remove to a heated platter, and keep warm. Add the almonds and lemon juice to the butter, and toss until the almonds turn golden brown. Stir in the parsley. Pour the butter-almond mixture over the crabs and serve.
