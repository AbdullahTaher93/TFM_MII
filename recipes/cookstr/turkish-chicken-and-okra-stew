Put the okra in a bowl and sprinkle with the vinegar and salt. Toss and let sit for 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a large earthenware casserole set on a heat diffuser, melt the butter with the oil over high heat. Once the butter stops sizzling, brown the chicken pieces, about 12 or (If you are not cooking with earthenware and a diffuser, cook over medium-high heat and check for doneness in about 8 minutes.) Remove the chicken and set aside. Add the onions, coriander, and red pepper and cook until the onions soften, stirring and tossing, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic, sugar, and oregano, stir, and add the tomato paste and tomatoes, stirring again to incorporate the paste. Bring to a boil, return the chicken to the pan, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until the meat is firm, turning it a few times, about 30 minutes. Put the okra in a strainer and rinse under running water. Arrange them on top of the chicken, pushing them down a little into the broth, then pour the lemon juice over everything, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until the okra is tender, shaking the casserole from time to time, about 40 minutes. Serve immediately.
