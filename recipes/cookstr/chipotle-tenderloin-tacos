In a small bowl, combine salt, peppercorns and garlic. Set aside. Place tenderloin in prepared baking dish. Coat top and sides of meat with olive oil. Press garlic mixture on top and sides of tenderloin. Then spread chiles on surface of meat. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Thirty minutes before baking, remove meat from refrigerator. Preheat oven to 375°F (l90°C). Bake on top shelf until juices run clear or an instant-read thermometer placed in center of tenderloin reads 135°F (57°C), 20 to 25 minutes for medium-rare. Switch oven setting to broil and broil until meat is crusty, 5 to 10 minutes. Let stand about 10 minutes before carving. Cut meat across the grain into ¼-inch (0.5 cm) slices. In a medium bowl, combine lettuce and cilantro. To build tacos, skillet warm tortillas. Divide meat equally among tortillas. Top with cheese and lettuce mixture. Fold tortillas in half.
