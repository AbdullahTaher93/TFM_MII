Brush any dirt from the mushrooms. Pull off and discard any tough stems. Chop large mushrooms into thick slices; leave small ones whole. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, sprinkle with a little salt, and saut√© for 2 to 3 minutes, until they begin to soften, adding a little more olive oil if needed. Add the shallots, garlic, and thyme and continue to cook until the mushrooms are tender. By this time they should have exuded their juices and begun to caramelize as some of the moisture evaporates and the mushrooms reabsorb the rest. Stir in the balsamic vinegar to taste and cook a minute or two longer. Stir in the parsley and butter and season with salt and pepper.
