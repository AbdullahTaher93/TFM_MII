Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat well with the oil, then add the bay leaf, 1 teaspoon salt, and hot broth. Season lightly with pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat, and let simmer, removing the lid occasionally to stir with a fork to prevent scorching, until the grains are fully cooked but not clumped together, 18 to 20 minutes. Use tongs to remove and discard the bay leaf. Use a fork to gently stir and separate the grains and stir in the butter; coconut milk, and cilantro. 3. Transfer the rice to a serving dish, or spoon it alongside other components, and serve at once.
