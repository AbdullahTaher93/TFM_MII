Break cinnamon into small pieces. In a small spice wok or dry cast-iron skillet, combine cinnamon, coriander, allspice and clove. Toast over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until the seeds begin to pop and their fragrance is released. Let cool. In a mortar (using pestle), pound toasted spices until finely ground. Add turmeric, ginger and garlic. Pound, stopping to add oil every few seconds until a smooth paste is formed. Variation: Use 2 tbsp (25 mL) ground turmeric in place of the fresh root and add in Step 2.
