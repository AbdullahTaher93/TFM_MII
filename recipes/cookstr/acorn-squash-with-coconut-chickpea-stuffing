Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) Lightly brush cut sides of squash with 1 tbsp (15 mL) coconut oil. Sprinkle with ½ tsp (2 mL) salt. Place cut side down on baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until tender. In a large skillet, melt the remaining oil over low heat. Add chickpeas, increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes or until heated through. Add currants and coconut milk; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Remove from heat and add spinach, coconut, mint and lemon juice, gently tossing to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Fill squash cavities with chickpea mixture.
