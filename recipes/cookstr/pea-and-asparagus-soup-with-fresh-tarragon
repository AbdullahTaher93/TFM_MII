Ladle into warmed soup bowls; garnish with Rye Croutons. To freeze: Cool. Ladle into freezer containers. Seal, label and date. Freeze for up to 4 months. To serve: Thaw soup in microwave or in refrigerator overnight. Proceed with step 3, above. From Marilyn Crowley and Joan Mackie: The Best Soup Cookbook
