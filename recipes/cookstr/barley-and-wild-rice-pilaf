Large (minimum 5 quart) slow cooker (see Notes) In a skillet, heat oil over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, rosemary and peppercorns and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and bring to a boil. Transfer to slow cooker stoneware. Add rice, barley and vegetable stock and stir well. Place two clean tea towels, each folded in half (so you will have four layers) over top of stoneware (see Tips, left). Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or on High for 4 hours. Sprinkle with pine nuts and serve hot.
