Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream butter with granulated and brown sugars until fluffy; beat in eggs and vanilla until smooth. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Beat into creamed mixture until combined; stir in white chocolate chunks and walnuts. Drop tablespoonfuls (15 ml) of dough 2 inches (5 cm) apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are firm. (Bake for the shorter time if you prefer cookies with a soft chewy center.) Cool 2 minutes on baking sheets; remove to wire rack and cool completely.
