About 3 hours before you plan to smoke the duck, place the breasts in a steamer over water and steam for 25 to 30 minutes. While the breasts steam, mix together the marinade ingredients in a lidded jar. When the duck has finished steaming, combine it with the marinade in a shallow, nonreactive dish or plastic bag and refrigerate for 2 hours. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. Remove the breasts from the refrigerator and drain them, discarding the marinade. Transfer the breasts to the smoker, skin sides up, and smoke until the duck is well-done but still moist, about 55 to 65 minutes at a temperature of 225° F to 250° F. Let the breasts sit for 5 minutes, slice the meat thin on the diagonal, and reserve. While the duck smokes, prepare the soup base. In a stockpot, warm the oil over high heat. Stir in the mushrooms and sauté until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the onions and ginger and sauté for another minute. Stir in the bok choy and pour in the stock. Add the soy sauce and both peppers, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 10 minutes. (The soup can be made to this point several hours in advance and refrigerated. Reheat it before proceeding.) Stir in the tofu and reserved duck, and heat just through. Remove the soup from the heat and quickly mix in the vinegar and sesame oil. Ladle the soup into bowls, top with the green onions, and serve immediately.
