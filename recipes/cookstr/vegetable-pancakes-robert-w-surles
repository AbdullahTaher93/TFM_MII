Blanch potatoes in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain in a strainer, but do not rinse. In a bowl combine the potatoes, carrots, zucchini, onion, parsley, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir just until combined. Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes. Shape vegetable mixture into small balls and flatten on waxed paper. Drizzle the oil in a large nonstick skillet and swirl it around until the oil coats the entire surface. Heat over medium heat until hot. Transfer pancakes to skillet with a spatula. Cook about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Tum pancakes over and cook another 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
