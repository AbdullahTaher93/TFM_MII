Soak the clams in a large pot of cold water, changing the water several times over the course of 2 to 3 hours. Agitate them every so often to loosen the sand from their shells. Drain into a colander and scrub. If using whole fresh mussels, scrub their shells well and, using a paring knife, cut away their beards. Heat the olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat, add the onion and sauté until translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute, to soften. Stir in the parsley. Pour in the wine and let it sizzle and boil off the alcohol. Add the tomatoes. Reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer for 8 minutes, until slightly thickened. Add the squid to the pot. Cook over low heat, covered, until tender, about 45 minutes. The squid should exude its own liquid. Check the pot occasionally, adding water, if necessary, to keep the squid covered by 1 inch. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste and the red pepper flakes. Add the clams and mussels. Cover and raise the heat to medium. As soon as they begin to open, add the shrimp and scallops. Simmer, covered, until the shrimp turns bright pink, the scallops are a glossy white, and the clams and mussels have opened fully. Remove any clams or mussels that haven’t opened. Serve immediately.
