In a medium bowl, mix the vinegar, oil, and soy sauce. Prepare a medium bowl of ice water, and set aside. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Snap off the woody ends of the asparagus spears and add to the boiling water for about 30 seconds, until the color brightens. Immediately move the asparagus to the ice water, then drain and add it to the bowl with the dressing. Stir to coat. Use a coarse cheese grater to shred the egg. To serve, divide the asparagus among 4 plates. Sprinkle with the pistachios and shredded egg.
