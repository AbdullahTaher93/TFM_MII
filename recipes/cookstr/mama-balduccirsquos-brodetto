In a nonreactive, large, heavy pot, combine the lamb, onion, tomatoes, 2 tablespoons parsley, the basil, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, the wine, and 1 cup water. Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat for 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, blanch the peas in ½ cup boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat, drain, and set aside to cool. In a bowl, beat together the eggs, cheese, the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, ½ teaspoon salt, and pinch of pepper. Stir in the peas; set aside. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the lamb in a large casserole. Pour the egg mixture over it. Bake until the custard is golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
