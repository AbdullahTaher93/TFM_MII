Preheat oven to 375°F, and spray a 9×5×3-inch loaf pan with dairy-free baking spray. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the shortening and ¾ cup sugar thoroughly, adding the water as the mixer runs. Beat until fluffy. In a separate mixing bowl, sift together the remaining dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Add the dry mixture to the shortening mixture, alternating it with the soy milk. In a separate bowl, mix together the 2 teaspoons cinnamon, the ½ cup sugar, and the margarine to make the topping. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the batter with the topping mixture. Bake for 45 minutes, or until an inserted cake tester comes out clean and the topping is crusty brown. Cool 10 minutes before slicing.
