Using 1 tablespoon of the butter, grease a large baking sheet. Arrange 18 lollipop sticks on the sheet, allowing at least 2½ inches between each stick. In a large saucepan, combine the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, corn syrup, and sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the sugar dissolves. Insert a candy thermometer in the mixture and cook, stirring, until the thermometer reads 270°F. Remove from heat and stir in the flavoring and food coloring. Let cool for about 1 minute, or just until the syrup is easily pourable, but slightly thickened and able to hold its shape once poured. Drop 1 tablespoon syrup onto the end of each stick, alternating ends. Let cool thoroughly before lifting, about 10 minutes. To store, wrap each lollipop in clear cellophane and tie with a ribbon, Pack in an airtight tin, where they will keep for up to 3 weeks.
