Place the millet and quinoa in a strainer, and rinse thoroughly under cold running water. Transfer the grains to a small saucepan, and add the water and a small pinch of salt. Place the pan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Cover, and turn the heat down as far as it will go, then simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Stir the millet and quinoa from the bottom of the pot with a fork, and keep fluffing the grains for a minute or two, then cover again, and continue to cook for about 5 minutes longer, or until the grains are perfectly tender. Transfer to a bowl, and fluff from the bottom with a fork to let steam escape. Let stand uncovered for about 15 minutes, repeating the fluffing procedure every few minutes or so. Stir in the toasted sunflower seeds, and serve warm or at room temperature with garnishes as desired.
