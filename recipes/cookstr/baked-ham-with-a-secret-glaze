In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, honey, red wine, pineapple juice, and garlic. Place the ham in the marinade, turn to coat it, and let it stand at room temperature for at least 1 or up to 4 hours, or cover and refrigerate overnight. Turn the ham in the marinade as many times as you remember to do so. Preheat the oven to 350°. Place the ham on a rack in an aluminum foil-lined roasting pan, reserving the marinade. Bake the ham, basting often with the reserved marinade, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the ham (not touching the bone) reads 120°, about 1 hour. To carve the ham, hold the meat steady with a carving fork and slice the meat horizontally, parallel to the bone. When you reach the bone, turn the ham over and repeat the procedure on the other side.
