Place all the ingredients in the pan according to the order in the manufacturer’s instructions. Program for the Dough cycle; press Start. The dough ball will be soft and very slightly moist. The softer you leave the dough, the lighter the muffins. You can always add a bit more flour when you remove the dough from the machine. Lightly sprinkle the work surface with cornmeal or semolina. When the machine beeps at the end of the cycle, press Stop and unplug the machine. Turn the dough out onto the work surface and, with a rolling pin, roll into a rectangle about ½ inch thick. Sprinkle the top surface with cornmeal or semolina to prevent sticking while rolling. Cut out the muffins with a 3-inch biscuit cutter or with the rim of a drinking glass. Roll out the trimmings and cut out the remaining muffins. Cover with a clean tea towel, or place them in the refrigerator if they are rising too fast while the others are baking. Preheat an electric griddle to 350° to 375°F, or heat a cast-iron stovetop griddle over medium heat until a drop of water sprinkled on the griddle dances across the surface, lightly grease the surface. Immediately place several muffins on the hot griddle. Cook for about 10 minutes on each side, turning them when they are quite brown, English muffins take time to bake all the way through, and they will swell and, be very puffy while baking. Remove the muffins from the griddle with a spatula and let cool on a rack.
