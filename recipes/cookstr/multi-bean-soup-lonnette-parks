Creating the Jar: Wash and thoroughly dry a 1-quart wide-mouth canning jar. Place all of the seasoning in the jar shown at left in a plastic sandwich bag. In another sandwich bag, place the aplit pea and lentil, and shake to mix. Layer the ingredients in the jar as shown at left, pressing firmly with a flat-bottomed object, such as a tart tamper of the bottom of a narrow glass, after each addition. Make the layers as level as possible. Secure the lid, and decorate as desired (see Notes). Attach the following instructions for making the soup: MULTI-BEAN SOUP Yield: 8 (1 cup) servings In addition to the contents of the jar, you will need to add the following ingredients: 6 cups water 2 cans (14 ounces each) stewed tomatoes Place the kidney, black, and red beans in a medium-sized pot or bowl. Add 6 cups boiling water, cover, and soak 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse the soaked beans, and place in a large pot with 6 cups fresh water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 Â½ hours. Add the tomatoes, and all of the remaining Jar ingredients. Simmer another 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover and continue to simmer another 45 to 60 minutes, or until the beans are tender and the soup thickens. Serve hot. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
