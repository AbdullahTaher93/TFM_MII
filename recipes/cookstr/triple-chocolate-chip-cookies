In a medium bowl, mix together flour, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, beat together melted butter, light brown and granulated sugars and vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture and beat just until combined. Fold in chocolate chips and milk and white chocolates. Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Scoop batter with ¼-cup (50 mL) measure or ice cream scoop and place on prepared baking sheets, about 3 inches (7.5 cm) apart. Bake in preheated oven for 14 to 16 minutes or until cookies are puffed and lightly golden (they will still be soft to the touch in the center and look somewhat undercooked). Let cookies cool completely on baking sheets on racks.
