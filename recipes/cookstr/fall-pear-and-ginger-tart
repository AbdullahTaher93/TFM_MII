To prepare the crust: In a food processor, combine the flours, sugar, crystallized ginger, pecans, and salt and pulse for 10 seconds. Add the cubes of chilled butter, a few at a time, pulsing on and off for 1 minute, until the mixture looks like bread crumbs. Add the egg yolk and vanilla, pulsing on and off until the mixture is combined. Press 2 cups of the mixture into the bottom and sides of the tart pan. Reserve the remaining crust dough for the top of the tart. Preheat the oven to 375°F. For the filling: In a medium bowl, mix the pears, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and ginger. Add the remaining ingredients, mixing with a spatula to coat the pears evenly. To assemble the tart: Arrange the pears in an attractive even layer in the crust and pour the remaining liquid on top. Remove the extra crust dough from the refrigerator and crumble evenly on top. Place the tart on a baking sheet lined with foil and bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack and serve warm with the whipped cream. For the vanilla whipped cream: Chill the metal bowl for a standing mixer (or if you’re using a hand mixer, a stainless-steel bowl) for about 10 minutes in the freezer. Pour the cream into the chilled bowl and beat with the whisk attachment on low speed, gradually increasing to high speed as the cream thickened, Slowly pour in the powdered sugar, and when the cream has thickened, add the pinch of salt and the vanilla. Continue beating until fully whipped.
