Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Using the top of a juice glass or a small biscuit cutter, cut two (2½-inch) rounds out of each slice of bread. Brush the rounds on both sides with the butter, and place on a baking sheet. Bake for about 2 minutes per side, or until lightly browned. Set the toasts aside to cool. (Toasts can be made ahead and cooled, then stored in an airtight container overnight) Stir the mayonnaise, lemon juice, chopped tarragon, and lemon zest together in a bowl, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the crabmeat, then season to taste with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Pile about 1 tablespoon of salad onto each toast, and serve. Variations: Substitute 8 ounces cooked lobster meat, chopped into ½-inch pieces, for the crabmeat. Substitute fresh chives or finely chopped scallions for the tarragon. Substitute lime zest and juice for the lemon. Place the finished canapés on the side of a tossed salad, or on top of a bed of lightly dressed arugula and watercress.
