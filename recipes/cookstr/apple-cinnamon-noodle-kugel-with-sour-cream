Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 13 × 9 × 2-inch baking dish. Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until barely tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, and drain well again. Transfer noodles to a large bowl. Separate noodles with your fingers. Add 3 tablespoons melted butter and a pinch of salt and mix well. Stir in sour cream, eggs, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla. Mix half the apples with the noodle mixture. In a small bowl, mix remaining sugar with 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Add half of noodle mixture to baking dish. Top with remaining apples in an even layer and sprinkle them with the cinnamon mixture. Top with remaining noodle mixture and spread gently to cover apples. Sprinkle with ½ teaspoon cinnamon, then with remaining melted butter. Cover dish and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 to 20 minutes or until set. Serve hot or warm.
