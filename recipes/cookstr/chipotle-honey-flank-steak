The night before you plan to smoke the steaks, combine the marinade ingredients except the honey in a lidded jar. Place the steaks in a plastic bag or shallow dish, pour the marinade over them, and refrigerate them overnight. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. Remove the steaks from the refrigerator. Drain them and reserve the marinade. Let the steaks sit at room temperature for 25 to 30 minutes. In a heavy saucepan, bring the marinade to a boil and boil vigorously for 5 to 10 minutes, until reduced by one-third. Stir in the honey and heat through. Keep the mixture warm for glazing the meat. Brush the steaks thickly with the glaze and transfer them to the smoker. Cook the steaks to rare or medium-rare, about 35 to 45 minutes at a temperature of 225° F to 250° F. Remove the steaks from the smoker and brush them again with the glaze. Let the steaks sit 5 minutes before slicing them thin across the grain. Serve the slices with additional glaze on the top or on the side, along with the cilantro.
