Place all the ingredients in a large casserole and bring to boil over medium heat, skimming off the froth as it rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve. Do not press on the solids. Let the stock cool. Store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator or freezer.
