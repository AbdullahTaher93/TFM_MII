Heat the milk and 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until warm but not hot. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs together. Whisk in 1/2 cup sugar, the flour, and the salt. Add the warm milk, whisking well to incorporate completely. Let the batter rest 1 hour at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Spread the walnuts on a baking sheet, and toast about 10 minutes, until they’re golden brown and smell nutty. When the nuts have cooled, chop them coarsely. Butter a 10-inch round or oval baking dish with the 1 teaspoon butter. (You could also make six individual clafoutis if you like.) Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in the dish, and tip it to coat the bottom and sides. Pour the batter into the dish. Scatter the walnuts and cranberries on top (most of them will sink). Bake about 45 minutes, until the clafoutis puffs up and is golden brown. While the clafoutis finishes baking, whip the cream and bourbon to soft peaks. Serve the clafoutis directly from the baking dish with the whipped cream on the side.
