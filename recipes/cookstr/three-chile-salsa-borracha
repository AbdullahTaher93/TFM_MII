Turn on the fan over the stove. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Remove the stems from the chiles, cut a slit up one side of each, and remove the seeds. Open up flat. One at a time, press the opened chiles flat onto the hot skillet until blistered and light brown. Turn and repeat, being careful not to burn. Place the chiles in a small, deep bowl and add 2 cups of the hot water. Soak the chiles for 45 minutes, pressing down occasionally into the water. Drain the chiles and place in a blender. Discard the soaking liquid. Add 2 cups of the remaining water and the garlic, onion, salt, peppercorns, allspice, clove, cinnamon, and cumin. Blend on high speed for 3 minutes, until very smooth. In a heavy saut√© pan, heat the oil. Add the chile puree. It will splatter, so be ready with a splatter screen. Cook the chile puree for 10 minutes, stirring several times. Rinse the blender with the remaining 1 cup of water and add the water to the pot along with the mezcal. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Strain through a food mill or sieve.
