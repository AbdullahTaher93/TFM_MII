Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in the sugar and cook, stirring often, until the sugar dissolves. Pour in the cream and stir until well combined and glossy. Increase the heat and boil gently, whisking, for 2 minutes, until thickened slightly. Remove from the heat and allow the sauce to cool. Serve warm or cold.
