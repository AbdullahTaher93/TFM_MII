First press the tofu for at least 30 minutes (see Notes). While the tofu presses, prepare the rest of the burger mix, and when you’re ready to grate the tofu, discard the expressed liquid. In a covered skillet on low heat, warm the oil. Add the onions, sprinkle with the salt and oregano, and cook on low heat for 7 or 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the carrots and bell peppers and cook, covered, until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl. Finely grate the pressed tofu in a food processor and add it to the bowl of cooked vegetables along with the walnuts, soy sauce, mustard, sesame oil, tahini, pepper, and basil. Mix well and add more soy sauce to taste. Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Using about a cup per burger, shape the mix into 8 burgers. Set the burgers on the prepared baking sheet and bake until firm and browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet.

Notes The burgers will be a little sturdier if you use bread crumbs, about 2/3 cup for this recipe, especially if the tofu you use if soft. Gluten free bread and bread crumbs are available, so if you're avoiding wheat and gluten you have that option. To freeze these burgers, simply wrap cooled, bake dburgers in plastic warp and put them in the freezer. To reheat, bake on an oiled baking sheet, right from the freezer, at 350° F for 20 to 30 minutes until heated through--the time will depend on how fat your burgers are.
