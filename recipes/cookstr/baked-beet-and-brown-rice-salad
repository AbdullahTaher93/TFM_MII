Preheat the oven to 375°F. Trim off any beet greens, leaving about a half-inch of stem intact. Rinse the beets. Wrap each beet individually in a tightly sealed aluminum foil packet, set the beets on a foil lined baking pan and bake until you can easily pierce them to the center with a cake tester or paring knife, 60 to 90 minutes. (You can pierce the beets right through the foil.) When they are cool enough to handle, gently rub the foil of each still-sealed packet against the skin of each beet. Slip off the beet skins along with the foil. Trim off the tail and stem ends. Cut the beets into ¼-inch pieces and set them in a bowl or storage container. Add the rice and toss until the rice is “dyed” beet red. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, and salt. Toss the dressing with the beets. Adjust the seasonings, adding more vinegar and/or salt, if needed, to intensify the flavors. Let the salad sit until the grains absorb some flavor, about 15 minutes. Stir in the scallion greens (if using) just before serving. Garnish with pine nuts. Serve at room temperature.
