Cut the chocolates into Â½-inch pieces. In a fondue pot over low heat, combine the chocolates, half-and-half, espresso powder, and cinnamon. Stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Keep warm over low heat. Arrange the dippers on a serving platter and set it next to the fondue pot. Spear the morsels with fondue forks and swirl them in the warm sauce.
