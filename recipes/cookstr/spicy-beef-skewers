Soak the wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. In a large, flat pan, dissolve the baking soda in 2 cups water. Add the beef and soak for 10 minutes. Remove the beef from the water and pat dry with paper towels. With a knife held at a sharp angle, cut across the grain into thin slices, about 2 Ã— 5 inches long. Place the beef onto a large flat platter. In a small bowl, to make the marinade, combine the vegetable oil, soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, sugar, cayenne, cornstarch, and hoisin sauce. Brush both sides of the beef with the marinade. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or longer. Thread 2 beef strips onto a 6-inch skewer. Repeat the procedure to use the remaining skewers. Preheat the broiler. Broil with the tops of the meat about 4 inches from the heat for about 2 minutes. Turn the skewers and broil for 2 additional minutes.
