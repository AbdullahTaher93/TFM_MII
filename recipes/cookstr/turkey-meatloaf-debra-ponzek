Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with butter. In a medium sauté pan, melt the butter over medium heat until it begins to bubble. Add the celery, carrot, shallots, and garlic and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables soften but do not color. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. In a large bowl, combine the turkey, bread crumbs, eggs, ketchup, cumin, thyme, salt and pepper. Add the sautéed vegetables and mix thoroughly with a large spoon or your hands. Transfer the mixture to the loaf pan and form into a smooth loaf. Bake for about 1 hour, or until cooked through. Let the meatloaf rest in the pan for about 5 minutes before unmolding, slicing, and serving.
