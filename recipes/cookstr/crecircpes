In a medium-size bowl combine the milk, eggs, oil, sugar, nutmeg and salt; mix well with a metal whisk. Add the flour and whisk again just until blended and no lumps of flour remain; do not overbeat. Very lightly oil an 8-inch slope-sided crêpe pan, then wipe it with a towel until the pan has only enough oil on it to be shiny. Heat the pan over medium heat about 2 minutes or until a drop of batter sizzles as soon as it’s dropped in the pan. Then pick up the pan and slant it away from you. Pour 2 tablespoons batter into the pan, quickly rolling the batter so it thoroughly coats the bottom and slightly up the sides of the pan; make the crêpe as thin as possible. Cook until the edges and bottom are golden brown, about 30 seconds to 1 minute; brown only one side of the crêpe. Remove the crêpe from the pan and place it on a plate to cool, browned side up. Heat the pan about 15 seconds before cooking the next crêpe. Repeat with remaining batter, re-oiling pan if necessary. Keep the crêpes covered with a damp cloth at room temperature until ready to serve. They should be used within 2 hours.
