Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and stir to coat with the oil. Add the sugar and stir again. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the onions and sugar begin to darken in color and caramelize, stirring occasionally. Add both of the paprikas, the dry mustard, salt, chili powder, and cayenne. Stir until the spices are well mixed, and let them toast in the pan. When the onions are soft and the spices are fragrant, add the Worcestershire sauce, cola, V8, ketchup, Jack Daniel’s, vinegar, and soy sauce. Let simmer over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes or until thickened. If you want a smooth texture, strain through a fine-mesh strainer. You can also use an immersion blender to blend the sauce. Let the sauce cool for about 10 minutes or until it is warm but no longer “boiling” hot. The sauce will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Spoon over cooked food just before serving. If desired, serve extra on the side.
