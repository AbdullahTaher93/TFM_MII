Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Cut the pita breads open into 2 round halves. Cut each circle into 6 triangles; you should have a total of 24 triangles. Lay the triangles on 2 baking sheets with the cut sides up. Lightly brush the bread with the oil. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper and any other flavoring choice. Bake the triangles for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool. Add a pinch of the following on top of the olive oil on each cracker: Garlic salt Sesame or poppy seeds Chopped fresh rosemary, thyme, chives, mint, oregano, verbena, or any of your favorite herbs ½ teaspoon ground cumin, dash of cayenne, and ½ teaspoon garam masala or curry mixed together
