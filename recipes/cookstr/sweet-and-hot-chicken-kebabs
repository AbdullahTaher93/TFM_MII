In a large bowl, whisk together the honey, olive oil, wine, salt, garlic, lemon juice, cayenne, and parsley. Add the chicken to the marinade, mixing to coat. Let the chicken marinate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight. During the last half hour, add the mushrooms and tomatoes to the marinade so they absorb some of the flavor. Preheat an indoor or outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Thread the chicken, tomatoes, and mushrooms onto metal skewers. Grill for 8 to 10 minutes total, or until the chicken is cooked through. (Cut into a piece of the chicken to check if it is fully cooked.)
