Combine all of the marinade ingredients and toss gently with the fish fillets. Set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Grill the fish or broil until done, cut into bite-size pieces, and arrange on a platter; cover to keep warm. Cook the rice noodles until done and then rinse in cool water and set aside. Heat the oil in a skillet or wok and add the peanuts, dill, salt, and chives (cut into 3-inch lengths, then quarter lengthwise). Saut√© until fragrant and hot, then pour over the cooked fish pieces. Serve with the noodles, herbs, lettuce, and dipping sauce for each diner to combine on his or her own bowl or plate.
