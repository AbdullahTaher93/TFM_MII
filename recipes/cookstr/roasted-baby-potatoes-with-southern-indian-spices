Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease a large, deep baking dish with some oil, add the potatoes, and set aside. Heat the oil with the curry leaves (if using), chiles, mustard seeds, and cumin seeds in a large skillet until the mustard seeds start to crackle and pop, about 1½ minutes. Stir in the ginger, garlic, and jalapeño and cook, stirring often, until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the turmeric and salt and cook for 1 minute. Pour the spices over the potatoes and stir until evenly coated. Bake the potatoes until tender and browned, 25 to 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven and stir in the cilantro, mint, lime juice, and cayenne pepper. Serve with lime wedges.
