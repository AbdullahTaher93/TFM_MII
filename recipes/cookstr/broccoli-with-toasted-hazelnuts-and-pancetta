Blanch the broccoli in boiling salted water or steam in a vegetable steamer just until crisp-tender. Drain and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes to infuse the oil with the flavor. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Add the broccoli to the skillet and toss to coat with the hot oil. Stir in the hazelnuts, lemon zest, and crumbled pancetta, then season with salt and pepper. Serve at once.
