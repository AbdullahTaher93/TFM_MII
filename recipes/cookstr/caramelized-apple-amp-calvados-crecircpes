Prepare the crêpes. Cover them with aluminum foil and keep warm in a 200°F oven, or cover and reheat them in a baking pan in a preheated 325°F oven for 5 to 10 minutes, or until heated through. Peel, core, and slice the apples. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat until it starts to sizzle. Add the apples, sprinkle with the sugar, and cook until the sugar turns amber, about 3 minutes. Gently sauté the apples and sugar until tender, another 4 to 5 minutes. Gently mix in the optional Calvados or Cognac and cinnamon, if you like; add the nuts. Set aside. Arrange a few slices of caramelized apples on one-quarter of each crêpe. Fold each crêpe in half twice so it is triangular in shape. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Top with a dollop of whipped cream or ice cream and serve at once.
