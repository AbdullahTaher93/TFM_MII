Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Combine the ground meats, salt, pepper, eggs, onion and cream. Make meatballs and roll in bread crumbs. Bake the meatballs for about 35 minutes. Taste meatballs and add a sprinkle of salt and pepper if needed. To make the sauce, melt the butter in a large pan. Whisk in flour and gradually stir in broth. Cook over low heat stirring constantly until sauce bubbles and thickens. Stir in sour cream and dill. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Serve the meatballs warm in a chafing dish or slow cooker. Pour sauce over meatballs and serve with toothpicks.
