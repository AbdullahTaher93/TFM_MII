Prepare the Dumplings: If using store-bought ricotta, put it in a sieve set over a bowl for about 30 minutes to allow any excess moisture to drain. Homemade ricotta does not need additional draining. In a bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, breadcrumbs, pecorino, parsley, and several grinds of black pepper. Mix thoroughly with a fork. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm the mixture so the dumplings will be easier to shape. Make a bed of flour on a dinner plate. For each dumpling, use 1 heaping teaspoon of the ricotta mixture and roll it between your palms into a ball about Â¾ inch (18 millimeters) in diameter. Roll in flour to coat lightly, then arrange on a tray. You should be able to make sixty to sixty-five balls. You can make the balls up to 4 hours ahead. Refrigerate uncovered on the tray. Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a 4-quart (4-liter) pot. Reduce the heat to a bare simmer and add the balls. Cook until they float to the surface, 2 to 3 minutes; do not allow the broth to boil or the dumplings may break apart. Divide among eight soup bowls and serve at once, garnishing with chopped parsley.
