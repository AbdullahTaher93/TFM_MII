The squashes may be baked in the oven or microwave. If you are going to use the oven, preheat it to 375°F. Cut the squashes in half lengthwise. Place the halves in a baking dish, cut side up, with about ½ inch of water, and cover with foil. Bake until easily pierced with a knife but still holding their shape, 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the type and size of squash used. Or microwave, using as a rule of thumb 4 to 7 minutes each for each squash. Test occasionally to make sure they don’t get overcooked. When the squashes are cool enough to handle, scoop out and discard the seeds. Scoop out the pulp and transfer to a mixing bowl, leaving a sturdy shell of about ¼ inch thick all around. Heat the margarine in a medium skillet. Add the onion and sauté over medium heat until golden. Add the almonds and continue to sauté until they give off a toasty aroma. Combine the onion mixture with the squash pulp. Add the ginger, season with salt and pepper, and stir together. Stuff back into the squash shells. Reheat in the microwave or oven, just until heated through, and serve.
