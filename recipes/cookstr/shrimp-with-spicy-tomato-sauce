In a medium saucepan, bring about 2 quarts of water to a boil. Add the shrimp, lemon juice, and bay leaf. Boil just until the shells turn pink, about 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the shrimp, let cool, then peel, devein, and set aside. Place the onion, basil, and garlic on a cutting board and, with a knife, chop the ingredients together until fine, making a battuto. Set aside. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil, add the onion mixture, and saute over medium heat until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, sea salt, pepper, oregano, wine, and water. Cover the pan, lower the heat, and simmer for about 25 minutes. Uncover the pan, stir in the shrimp and olives, re-cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Set the sauce aside and keep warm. In a large pot, bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Drain and place on a platter. Pour over the sauce, mix gently, and serve immediately.
