On a clean working surface, spread out the pounded chicken filets. Cover each with a slice of prosciutto and sprinkle with 14 of the pecorino cheese. Roll up each filet and close it with a toothpick. Set aside. In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the roll-ups and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, until they are well browned on all sides. Add the wine, scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any pieces of meat, reduce the heat, and cook for 10 minutes. Add salt, to taste.
