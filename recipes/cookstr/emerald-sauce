Put the ingredients into a blender jar in the order listed–first the oils, lime juice, vinegar, then the aromatics (ginger, garlic, jalapeños), the sugar and salt, and finally the herbs (cilantro, mint, basil) and ¼ cup of the peanuts. Blend, stopping occasionally to scrape down the jar with a spatula, until the mixture is quite smooth. Taste and adjust salt to your liking. Add the remaining ¼ cup peanuts and pulse a few times to roughly chop them for a bit of crunch in the sauce. Use immediately, or cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
