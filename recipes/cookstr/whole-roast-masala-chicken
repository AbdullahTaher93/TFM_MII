Put the cumin seeds and coriander seeds into a dry frying pan over a high heat until the coriander seeds turn from meadow green to a lightly toasted golden color. Tip the toasted spices into a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, along with the cinnamon stick, cloves, and peppercorns, and grind together. Put them into a big bowl and add the ground almonds, turmeric, yogurt, and salt. Bash the onion and garlic to a pulp with a small pinch of salt, then add this to the bowl and mix thoroughly. Get an oven dish big enough to hold the chicken in, and line the dish with foil. Make a small slit at the bottom of the chicken breast on both sides, then rub some of the spice marinade between the skin and flesh, getting into the nooks and crannies. Don't be shy now. Rub the rest of the marinade all over the chicken. Cover with foil and leave in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. When you're ready to cook the chicken, preheat the oven to 400Â°F. When the oven is hot, cover the chicken loosely with foil (so that the marinade does not burn) and cook for 1 hour. Remove the foil after an hour and cook for another 20 minutes to brown it nicely on top. Check that the chicken is done by piercing a thigh with a knife and making sure that the juices run clear. Serve with my ferrari potatoes and spinach with black pepper, garlic, and lemon.
