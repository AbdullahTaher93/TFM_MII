Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C) Crust: In a food processor fitted with metal blade, process cookies until finely ground, about 20 seconds. You should have ¾ cup (175 mL). Transfer to a bowl and mix in butter. Press into bottom of cheesecake pan and freeze until filling is ready. Filling: In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate on Medium (50%), stirring every 30 seconds, until soft and almost melted, 1 to 1½ minutes. Stir until completely melted and smooth. Let cool slightly. In clean food processor work bowl fitted with metal blade, process cream cheese and sugar until smooth, about 20 seconds. With motor running, add melted chocolate, eggs and vanilla through the feed tube and process until blended. Pour over frozen crust, smoothing out to sides of pan. Sprinkle chocolate chips over top. Bake in preheated oven until it starts to pull away from sides of pan and center has a slight jiggle to it, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack for 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Variations: Use white chips in place of the semisweet for a black and white cheesecake.
