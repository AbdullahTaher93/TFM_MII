Season the chicken and rabbit generously with salt. In a 16-to 18-inch paella pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and rabbit and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add all the beans and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the garlic, tomatoes, and 2 pinches of salt and cook, stirring from time to time, until the tomato has darkened to a deeper shade of red, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the snails (if using), sprinkle in the piment√≥n, and add the water. Bring to a simmer, and continue simmering for 10 minutes, or until the meat and beans are tender. Add the saffron and (if you are not using snails) the rosemary. Taste for salt and adjust the seasoning as needed. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Sprinkle in the rice. With a wooden spoon, probe the pan to make sure the rice is evenly distributed. Do not stir again. Cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes over high heat, then reduce it to low and cook for an additional 8 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al punto, with just a bite to it. Remove the paella from the heat, cover with paper towels, and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
