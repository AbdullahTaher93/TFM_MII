Saute the salt pork or bacon in a 2-quart flameproof casserole or Dutch oven until it releases its fat and starts to brown; remove and reserve. Drain off and discard all but 1 tablespoon fat. Add the onion and saute, stirring constantly, until the onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Stir the beans, water, molasses, brown sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper into the onion mixture in the casserole. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Stir in the reserved salt pork. Bake the beans, uncovered, 20 to 30 minutes or until they are bubbly and the top is crisp.
