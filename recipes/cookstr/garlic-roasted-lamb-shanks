Heat the oven to 475° F. With your fingers, push the garlic slivers into the natural openings in the lamb shanks and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Arrange the lamb shanks and bell peppers in a single layer in 1 or 2 roasting pans. Roast for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven heat to 350° F and roast until the peppers are soft and the skins are wrinkled, about 1 hour more. Remove the peppers and continue roasting the shanks until the meat is well browned and pulling away from the bones, about 50 minutes more. Remove and let cool enough to handle. When the peppers are cool, use your fingers and a paring knife to peel off the skins. Remove the stems and seeds; cut the peppers into thin strips. Set aside. When the lamb shanks are cool enough to handle, remove the bones and shred the meat. In a bowl, toss the chick-peas with the lime juice, oil, and ¼ teaspoon salt. To assemble, spread about 1/3 cup of the lamb in the center of a tortilla. Top with bell pepper strips, chick-peas, South American Jalapeño-Parsley Salsa, and sour cream. Fold and serve. VARIATION You can sauté the red peppers instead of roasting them. Remove the stems and seeds and cut the peppers into ½-inch-wide strips. Sauté the pepper strips in 1/8 inch of olive oil or peanut oil until quite wilted and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
