Place the shrimp in a saucepan. Add the lime and lemon juices, water, and salt and bring just to a boil. Pour the mixture into a shallow dish, refrigerate it, and marinate the shrimp in the liquid for 45 to 60 minutes. Drain the shrimp and add the oil and pepper to them. The shrimp can be served immediately or refrigerated for several more hours before serving. Arrange the shrimp on a decorative platter, garnished with lime and lemon. Since the shrimp are intended to be peeled at the table, supply plenty of napkins.
