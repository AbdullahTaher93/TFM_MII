In a small bowl, slightly beat the eggs with the salt. Set aside. Soak the black mushrooms in hot water for 20 minutes, or until soft. Cut off the stems and discard. Cut the mushroom caps into Â½-inch diced pieces. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 teaspoons water. In a 3-quart soup pot, place the chicken broth and mushrooms. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Add the tofu, tomato, and peas and return to a boil. Lower the heat, stir in the cornstarch mixture, and return to high heat. When the soup returns to a rolling boil, pour in a spoonful of the egg mixture, stirring in a circular motion. When shreds have formed, continue to add spoonfuls of the egg mixture to the boiling soup, stirring constantly with a fork until all the egg mixture forms shreds, about 30 seconds. Serve.
