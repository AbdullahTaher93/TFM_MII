Combine all the ingredients for the marinade in a bowl. Add the wings, cover, and refrigerate overnight or longer. To make the salsa brava, place all ingredients in a food processor and purée as smooth as possible. Reserve (this will keep for weeks refrigerated). Heat the oil to 350°F, preferably in a deep fryer. (Otherwise pour oil to a depth of at least 1 inch in a skillet, and heat until the oil quickly browns a cube of bread.) Remove the wings from the marinade, drain on paper towels, then dredge in flour. Fry the wings in several batches until golden brown for 6–10 minutes, depending on the size of the wings, turning once. Drain on paper towels. [May be kept warm in a 200°F oven for up to 30 minutes] Serve with a bowl of the sauce to dip the wings.
