Put the yeast, sugar, and water into a small bowl. Stir and let rest for 10 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Add the melted lard or olive oil to the yeast mixture and pour into the well. Work into a dough with a wooden spoon. On a lightly floured board, knead the dough, folding it over and over until it is smooth and silky. Add a little flour as needed until the dough is no longer sticky. Shape the dough into a ball and, with olive oil on your hands, lightly coat the dough. Put it into a bowl and cover it with a dish towel. Let the dough double in size in a warm place. This takes about 1 hour. When the dough has risen, follow instructions in individual pizza recipes.
