Preheat the oven to 425°F. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender or two knives, work in the butter until it resembles coarse meal. Mix in the eggs one at a time, and then the cream and orange zest. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Roll out the dough until it is ¾ inch thick. Cut out the scones using a 3-inch round cookie cutter. Place them on a baking sheet and bake in the center of the oven until lightly golden and crusty, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the scones from the oven and allow them to cool. You can prepare these 1 to 2 days ahead. Keep them wrapped in plastic wrap.
