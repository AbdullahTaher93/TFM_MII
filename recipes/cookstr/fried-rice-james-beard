Cook the rice in the oil approximately 5 minutes to heat through, shaking the pan and tossing the rice with a fork from time to time. Add the green onions, mushrooms, and your choice of ham, pork, chicken, or shrimp. Toss in well. Combine the eggs and soy sauceâ€”add additional soy to taste, if you like. Stir into the rice off the heat and toss with a fork until the eggs are set. Transfer to a heated dish. Garnish with additional shredded green onions or with sliced toasted almonds. For an unusual and delicious flavor, also add chopped fresh coriander.
