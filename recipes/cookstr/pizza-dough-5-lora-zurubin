Combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar in a small bowl and stir until the yeast dissolves, 3 to 5 minutes. Combine 3 cups of the flour and the salt on a work surface. Make a well, then add the yeast mixture and 1 tablespoon of the oil. Knead the dough until firm and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes, adding additional flour if needed. Grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Shape the dough into a ball, add to the bowl, and turn to coat it completely with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in a warm spot until the dough has doubled in size, 2 to 2½ hours. Punch the dough down, divide it in half, and shape it into 2 balls. Oil another large bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Place one dough ball in each bowl and rotate them to coat them completely with the oil. Cover both bowls with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm draft-free spot for 1 hour or until doubled in size. When doubled in size, punch the dough down again. Flatten out each ball on a lightly floured surface. Using your hands, gently press and stretch out each piece of dough into an oval approximately ½-inch thick and 12 by 9 inches in diameter. Be careful not to overwork the dough.
