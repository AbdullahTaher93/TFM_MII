Place 2 cups of the black beans in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse until chunky. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, add the remaining whole black beans, along with the panko, eggs, scallions, basil or cilantro, garlic, cumin, oregano, and red pepper flakes and mix until well combined. Divide the mixture into 4 portions and form each into a patty about Â¾ to 1 inch thick, tossing it back and forth between your hands. Sprinkle the patties with the salt and pepper. Place a cast iron skillet over high heat and when it is hot but not smoking add the burgers to the dry pan. Cook until well seared on both sides and heated throughout, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
