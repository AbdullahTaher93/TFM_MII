Trim off the chicken wing tips and tail. Set them aside for another use. With a large heavy knife or cleaver, cut up the chicken at the joints. Cut the breasts, thighs, and legs into 2-inch chunks. Rinse the pieces and pat dry. Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces in a single layer. Cook, turning the pieces occasionally, until nicely browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Lower the heat to medium. Spoon off the fat. Place the butter in the pan, and when it is melted, add the garlic. Turn the chicken pieces in the butter and add the lemon juice. Add the wine and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook, turning the pieces occasionally, until the chicken juices run clear when pierced with a knife in the thickest part of the thigh, about 10 minutes. If there is a lot of liquid remaining, remove the chicken to a serving platter and keep warm. Turn the heat to high and boil until the liquid is reduced and slightly thickened. Stir in the parsley and pour over the chicken.
