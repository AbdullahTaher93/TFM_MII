Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch (23-centimeter) round baking pan. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, and almond extract until frothy. Pour in the slightly cooled butter and stir until well blended. Sift in the flour and mix until the batter is smooth and creamy. Pour the batter into the baking pan. Scatter the blackberries evenly over the top. You don't need to press the berries into the cake; their weight makes them sink a bit during baking. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until golden brown on top. The cake is done when a toothpick or knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove the cake and let cool before serving.
