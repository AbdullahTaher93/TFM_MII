Prepare the soufflé: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and sugar an 8-cup soufflé dish, tapping out excess sugar. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with ¾ cup of the sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg until thick, creamy and lemon colored. Whisk in the milk. Place the cubed bread in a large bowl. Pour the milk mixture over the bread. Set aside for 45 minutes, so the bread soaks up the milk mixture. Using an electric mixer at low speed, beat the egg whites until they are foamy. Add the salt and increase the speed to medium. When the whites begin to form stiff peaks, gradually add the remaining ¼ cup of sugar, increasing the speed to high. Beat until the whites are stiff and glossy. Stir the raisins and pecans into the soaked bread. Fold in the meringue, making sure not to overmix. Transfer the mixture into the prepared mold and bake for 35 to 40 minutes until puffed and golden. Prepare the sauce: In a double boiler, heat the cream over simmering water. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until lemon colored. Gradually whisk in the heated cream. Return the mixture to the double boiler and cook over simmering water, stirring constantly until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Slowly add the bourbon. Pour the sauce into a heated sauceboat and serve with the soufflé.
