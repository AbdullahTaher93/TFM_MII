In a small saucepan, bring the wine to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer the wine for about 25 minutes, or until reduced to 2 tablespoons. Cut each bison strip steak into 4 equal square or rectangular pieces. Rub both sides of the steaks with grapeseed oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Sear the steaks in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat for about 1Â½ minutes on each side, or until lightly browned. You might find it easier to use 2 skillets. In a small bowl, whisk the reduced wine syrup and fig syrup together. Drizzle each steak with all but about 2 tablespoons of the wine mixture. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, turning constantly, so that the syrup glazes the meat. Cook about 2 minutes longer for rare, or 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer the steaks from the pan to a cutting board. Let them rest for about 3 minutes, or until cool to the touch. Cut each steak into small cubes. Reassemble the cubes into the shape of the original steaks, pressing them together to adhere, and place each on a warmed plate. Arrange the fig quarters on each plate and garnish with watercress. Drizzle the remaining wine syrup over each plate and serve.
