In a medium-sized bowl, combine the flour, wine, and water. Whisk until the mixture resembles a thin pancake batter. Heat the oil in a deep, heavy pot over high heat to a temperature of 350Â°F or until just before smoking. Dip a blossom into the batter, shaking off any excess against the side of the bowl. Drop it gently into the oil allowing it to brown nicely for a few minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the blossom and drain it on paper towels or on a wire rack placed over paper towels. Repeat with the remaining blossoms, frying no more than 3 at a time. If you crowd the blossoms, they will lower the temperature of the oil and you will not get as crispy results. Salt the blossoms generously and eat while warm.
