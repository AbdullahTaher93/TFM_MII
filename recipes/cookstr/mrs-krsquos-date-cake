Make the cake: Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Line an 8-½” (21 cm) square pan with parchment paper, or spray with nonstick spray. Place the dates in a medium bowl and pour the boiling water over them; stir briefly. Add the ½ cup (90 g) Sucanat, flax seeds, coconut milk, oil and vanilla, and stir to blend. Allow the mixture to sit until it reaches room temperature, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Pour the cooled wet mixture over the dry and stir to blend. Turn into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle the topping ingredients over the cake: first, sprinkle the 2 Tbsp (30 ml) Sucanat evenly over the surface of the batter. Cover with a sprinkling of the coconut, and end with the chocolate chips. Bake for 35-40 minutes, rotating pan about halfway through, until a tester inserted in the center of the cake come out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for at least 20 minutes before cutting (if you cut this cake while it’s still warm, the still-melty chips will cling to the knife and you will end up with a blob of goo instead of a piece of cake). May be frozen.
