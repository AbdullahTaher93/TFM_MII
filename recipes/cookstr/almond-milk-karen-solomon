Soak the almonds in water to cover by 1 inch for at least 6 hours or overnight. They will plump up by about 30 percent while soaking. Drain the almonds and place them and the water in the blender. Blend on the highest setting for a full 2 minutes. Pour the milk: through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing down on the solids as you go. Discard the solids and strain the milk one more time, this time not squeezing the solids. The milk is ready to drink immediately: try it straight up or over ice. Kept refrigerated, almond milk: will last for 5 days. Frozen, it will last for up to 4 months.
