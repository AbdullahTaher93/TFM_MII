In a large, heavy pan, heat the olive oil and sesame oil. Brown the whole chicken on all sides. Add the soy sauce, sherry, ginger, green onions, star anise, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer on very low heat for 40 minutes or until almost done, turning once or twice for even cooking. Add the sugar and simmer covered for 5 more minutes. Cool slightly, then cut the chicken in serving-size pieces. Garnish with cilantro.
