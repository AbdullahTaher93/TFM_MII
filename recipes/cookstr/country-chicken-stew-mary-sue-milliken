Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken evenly on all sides, then transfer to a flameproof casserole. Add the onions and carrots to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to the casserole with the chicken. Place the potatoes around the edges and season with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add bay leaf. Pour off most of the fat from the skillet and return to high heat. Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to release all the browned bits, about 3 minutes. Pour over the chicken and add the stock. Place the casserole over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, 25 to 30 minutes, until the chicken thighs are cooked through. (Check the pan occasionally to make sure the liquid is at a slow simmer.) To make the picada, combine the almonds and garlic in a food processor and process to a fine paste. Add the saffron and hard-boiled egg yolks and process again, adding enough liquid from the casserole to make a smooth paste. Set aside. With a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken and vegetables to a serving tureen, and discard the bay leaf. Return the casserole to medium-high heat and whisk the picada into the cooking liquid. Pour over the chicken and vegetables, sprinkle with the egg whites, and serve.
