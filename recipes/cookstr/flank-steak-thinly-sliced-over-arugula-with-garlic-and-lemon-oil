Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill on high. Remove the flank steak from the refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes before grilling and place it on a large, rimmed baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine the 2 tablespoons olive oil and the garlic. Rub the steak on both sides with the mixture and season with salt and pepper. Oil the grill grate. Place the flank steak directly over the hot fire. Cover the grill and sear the steak on one side, 4 minutes for rare or 6 minutes for medium-rare. Turn, re-cover, and cook for 4 minutes more, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 120°F for rare or 130° to 135°F for medium-rare. Transfer the steak to a carving board and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut the meat across the grain into ¼-inch-thick slices. Scatter an equal amount of arugula on each dinner plate. Arrange overlapping slices of steak over the greens and spoon any accumulated juices over the top. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the lemon olive oil over each portion of steak and sprinkle with fleur de sel. Serve immediately.
