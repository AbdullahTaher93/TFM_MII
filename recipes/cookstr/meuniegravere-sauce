In a 1-quart saucepan combine the stock and garlic. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes. Remove from heat. In a 1-quart saucepan melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over high heat. Add the flour and whisk with a metal whisk until smooth, about 10 seconds. Remove from heat. Return stock mixture to a medium heat. Gradually add the butter mixture to the stock mixture, whisking constantly until smooth. Reduce heat to very low. Add the remaining 2Â½ sticks of butter, about a third at a time, whisking constantly each time until butter is melted. Gradually add the Worcestershire, whisking constantly, and add the salt. Continue cooking until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes, whisking often. The sauce may be kept warm (or reheated) by setting the pan over another pan of hot (but not boiling) water.
