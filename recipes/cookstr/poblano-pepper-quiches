Preheat oven to 375ºF. Coat a shallow roasting pan with cooking spray. Arrange poblano peppers in roasting pan, skin-side down (arrange peppers snugly in pan, so they don’t tip over). In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until lightly beaten. Stir in cheddar cheese, ham and salsa. Add ½ teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Spoon egg mixture into poblano peppers, filling almost to the top. In a small bowl, combine parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. Sprinkle mixture over egg mixture. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until eggs are set and top is golden brown.
