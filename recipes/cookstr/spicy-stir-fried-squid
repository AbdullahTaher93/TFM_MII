Clean and slice the squid into thin pieces about 2 inches long. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, chili paste, sugar, chili powder, sesame oil, and ginger. Set aside. Slice the carrot into thin flat pieces about 2 inches long. Cut the green onions about the same size, on the diagonal into about 2-inch lengths. In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Then add the squid, onion, carrot, and bell pepper. (Save the green onions to add later.) Cook until the squid is cooked. The meat will turn opaque and the pieces will curve. Add the green onions and cook for another minute. Serve immediately, sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, if you wish. Serve with rice (or over a bed of rice for informal meals), kimchi, and other banchan.
