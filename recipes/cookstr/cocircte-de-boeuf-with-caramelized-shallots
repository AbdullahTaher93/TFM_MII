Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the whole shallots, and color them over high heat. Once colored, drain off and throw away the oil. Add the butter, bay leaves, thyme, and some salt to the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, turning and shaking the shallots; try not to burn the butter. Add enough stock just to cover the bottom of the pan and let the liquid bubble away before adding any more; the sauce will reduce and become sticky while cooking the shallots at the same time. Continue until the shallots are very soft and have a thick buttery and beefy glaze. Meanwhile, heat a ridged cast-iron grill pan or broiler pan until very hot (about 10 minutes). Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Season the steaks well with pepper and score the fat a little. Place the steaks fat-side down in the grill pan. The fat will start to melt and this is what is going to flavor the outside of the meat. Once the fat starts to char, let the steaks fall naturally onto one side. Cook for 4 minutes. Turn the steaks over and cook the other side for 4 minutes. Turn over again, but also rotate the steaks 180 degrees, then cook for 2 minutes longer. Flip the steaks over again, rotating as before. Place the pan in the oven to finish cooking for about 6 minutes for a medium steak. Let them rest for 5 minutes before serving them whole, with carving done at the table.
