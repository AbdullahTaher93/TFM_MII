In a large saucepan, combine 2 cups of the hot water with the salt, honey, cloves, peppercorns, and allspice. Add the bay leaves and thyme along with the remaining hot water. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently until the salt has dissolved. Boil for 3 minutes, then remove from the heat. Add the ice water and stir to cool the mixture. Set aside and let cool to room temperature. Proceed with brining the turkey.
