Cream the butter, and cream in the sugar and peanut butter. Beat in the eggs until fluffy (medium high speed on a mixer). Sift the dry ingredients together and add alternately with the milk and vanilla to the first mixture. Blend just until smooth. If using an electric mixer, set at lowest speed and add flour, then milk and vanilla. Mix until well blended, and use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of bowl. Turn into 12 to 18 well-greased cupcake pans or frilled paper cupcake holders set in muffin pans; or bake in two 8 or 9 inch layers or a 10 × 14 × 2-inch sheet pan. Grease and flour the cake pans. Bake in a moderate oven, 350 degrees, 15 to 25 minutes for layers or cupcakes or 35 minutes for sheet cake. Test by pressing lightly in the center of the cake. If it springs back, it is done. Cool the cake a few minutes, loosen it from the pan, and turn out on a wire rack to cool. Frost, if you like, with butter frosting, to which ½ cup chopped roasted peanuts have been added. Or use peanut butter instead of butter in the frosting.
