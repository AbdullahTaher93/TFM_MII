Preheat oven to 350°F. In a small bowl, toss the pecans with 1 tablespoon of the oil and the barbecue rub. Spread pecans on a baking sheet and toast 10 to 15 minutes, watching carefully to prevent over-browning. Set aside. In a large pot, add shrimp, 2 cups water, and shrimp and crab boil. Cook shrimp until done. Drain and cool. To prepare the dressing, combine remaining oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper. Whisk well. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. To assemble the salads, drain and rinse the greens. Place a mound of greens on each of 4 plates. Using 8 shrimp per plate, alternate shrimp and mango slices in a radial design around the plate’s edge. Garnish with toasted pecans and cheese, and drizzle with dressing.
