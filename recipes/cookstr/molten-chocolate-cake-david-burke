Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Lightly coat six 4-inch-round Ã— 2-inch-high molds with nonstick vegetable spray. Set aside. Combine the chocolate and butter in a stainless steel bowl set over a pan of boiling water. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. Heat, stirring constantly, just until the chocolate and butter has melted. Remove the mixture from the heat but keep warm. Place the eggs and egg yolks in the large bowl of an electric mixer. Begin beating the eggs and, with the motor running, add the sugar in thirds, beating to incorporate well between each addition. Continue beating on high for about 7 minutes, or until the mixture has doubled in size and is a soft pale yellow. Lower the speed of the mixer and add the almond flour in thirds, beating to incorporate well between each addition. Slowly beat the reserved melted chocolate-butter mixture into the batter, beating for 1 minute. Fill the prepared molds with the batter. Place them in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes, or until the top is just set with a slight crater in the center. Remove from the oven and quickly invert onto six dessert plates. Serve hot with whipped cream on the top, if desired.
