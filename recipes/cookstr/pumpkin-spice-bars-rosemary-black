Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Spray a 9 by 13-inch baking pan and an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray. In the bowl of an electric mixer, stir together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg. Add the eggs, pumpkin, and oil and beat with the mixer set on medium speed until no traces of flour remain. Spread evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bars comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool for 2 to 3 hours. Spread with Cream Cheese Icing and cut into bars. Store in a single layer, tightly wrapped, for 2 days at room temperature or 4 days in the refrigerator. To freeze, wrap tightly and place in freezer for up to 1 month.
