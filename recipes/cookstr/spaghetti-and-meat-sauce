Brown the ground beef. Drain off as much fat as you can. Add the rest of the ingredients. Bring to a boil, then turn down heat. Cover and simmer for about 1 hour. Stir every now and then so the sauce doesnâ€™t stick. Add extra water if it gets too thick. Serve over hot spaghetti (see Notes), with parmesan cheese if you like.
