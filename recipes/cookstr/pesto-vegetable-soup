Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until golden, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the carrots, zucchini, and yellow squash. Then add the water, beans, tomatoes, parsley, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 40 minutes. The recipe can be made ahead up to this point. Refrigerate until ready to continue. Meanwhile, make the pesto by pureeing the Parmesan, basil, and garlic in a food processor or blender. With the machine running, slowly add the oil until a paste forms. Stir half the pesto into the soup and remove from the heat. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately, with the additional pesto.
