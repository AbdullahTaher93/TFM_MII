Combine the papaya and carrot in a bowl. Add the scallions and hot red pepper flakes. Set aside. In a small bowl, combine the “fish“ sauce, lime juice, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine, then pour over the salad and toss until well mixed. Arrange on salad plates and garnish with the cilantro and tomato wedges.
