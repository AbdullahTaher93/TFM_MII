Hull and chop the strawberries. Put into a bowl, add the sugar and pomegranate juice, and leave to macerate while you whip the cream. Whip the cream in a large bowl until thick but still soft. Roughly crumble in 4 of the meringue nests â€” you will need chunks for texture as well as a little fine dust. Take out about half a cupful of the chopped strawberries, and fold the meringued cream and the rest of the fruit mixture together. Arrange on 4 serving plates or glasses or in a mound, and top each one with some of the remaining macerated strawberries.
