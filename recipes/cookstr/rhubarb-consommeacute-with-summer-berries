Cook the rhubarb: Wash and dry the rhubarb. Trim off the ends of each stalk and chop the stalks into ½-inch pieces. In a medium saucepan, combine the rhubarb, 1½ cups water, and sugar. Bring to a boil and simmer the rhubarb for 3 minutes. Do not stir the rhubarb. Remove from the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes. Strain and chill the rhubarb: Drape a piece of cheesecloth over a strainer and suspend the strainer over a stainless-steel bowl. Pour the rhubarb into the strainer and allow the liquid to drain for 15 minutes. Remove the strainer and place the bowl in an ice bath to chill. You will have a little more than 1 cup of rhubarb pulp remaining in the cheesecloth. Freeze the rhubarb and save it for the Strawberry-Rhubarb Crisp recipe. Serving Suggestions: Serve this soup with sliced strawberries, fresh blueberries, and a dollop of crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream. If you have time, I recommend making the Honey and Yogurt Panna Cotta. Place the panna cotta in the center of a serving bowl and pour 4 ounces of the consommè over the custard into the bowl. At the restaurant I add a few teaspoons of fresh passion-fruit pulp, some diced mango, and cubes of guava Jell-O. Add whatever fresh berries or stone fruit are available to complement the custard and the tangy rhubarb.
