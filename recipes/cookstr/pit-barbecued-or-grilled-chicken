Baking Heat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Prepare and wrap the chicken in the same way as for steaming. Place in one layer in a casserole with ½ cup (125 ml) of water in the bottom. Cover with a lid or more banana leaves and bake for about 30 minutes. Increase heat to 375°F (190°C), turn the package over to baste, and return to the oven, uncovered, and bake until tender-about 20 minutes. To Serve If the grilling method is used, cover grilled chicken lavishly with the toppings, If the chicken is steamed or baked and covered with the leaves (see Notes), open up packages and cover meat with toppings. Atternately pass toppings for diners to serve themselves.
