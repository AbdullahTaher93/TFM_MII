Beat the egg and mix in a little white wine to thin it out. Cut the bread for sandwiches in 6" lengths to fit the crabs and toast it lightly. Heat a skillet on medium high heat that is large enough to fit all the crabs without crowding. Cook in batches if your pan is too small. When the pan is hot, add the olive oil then stir in the butter. Cook for 15 seconds before adding the white wine. In the meantime, mix the salt, chili pepper into the flour in a flat, shallow bowl or on a paper plate. Dredge the crabs one at a time, first through the flour and then through the egg mixture, and immediately add each one to the hot butter-wine sauce in the pan. It should sizzle a little bit and float in the sauce enough so they do not stick. Shake the pan a little to keep them from sticking, but do not use a utensil until the coating has solidified or it will fall off. After 2-3 minutes on one side, carefully flip the crabs over and lightly brown the other side until it firms up a bit. By the end of the cooking there's likely be little sauce left in the pan. Spread whatever drippings remain plus a smear of Dijon mustard on to the toasted bread. Layer the toasted baguette with whole lettuce leaves and one crab for each sandwich. Squeeze some lemon juice on each crab, add ground pepper to taste, and top with the toasted lid. Yummm!
