In the bottom of a flameproof tagine, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and ras el hanout and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add chicken, meaty side down sliding thighs around and moving onions away from bottom so that flesh is in direct contact with bottom of tagine. Cook for about 5 minutes or until chicken is browned on meaty side. Using tongs, turn chicken over. Add bell peppers, apricots, prunes, figs and dates. Pour broth over and bring to a boil. Cover with tagine lid, reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring once, for 25 to 30 minutes or until juices run clear when chicken is pierced with a fork.
