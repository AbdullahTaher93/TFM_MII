Brush 2 tbsp of the oil over the tuna steaks. Season with salt and a generous amount of pepper. Refrigerate until ready to cook. Heat 2 tbsp of the remaining oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the fennel and cook, stirring often, about 4 minutes, just until crisp-tender. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Add the cucumber, shallots, lemon juice, remaining 2 tbsp oil, and the herbs to the fennel and mix. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large frying pan over high heat until very hot. Add the tuna and cook, turning once, about 1 minute per side, until seared. Transfer each tuna steak to a dinner plate. Using a slotted spoon, serve the salad on top, and drape 2 anchovies over each serving. Garnish each with a lemon wedge. Spoon the dressing around the tuna and serve immediately.
