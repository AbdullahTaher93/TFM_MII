In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the beans to a boil with the water, onion, and bay leaf. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 40 to 50 minutes, until the beans are very tender. Skim off any white foam that forms at the top as the beans cook. Drain the beans into a colander and discard the bay leaf. While the beans are still warm, toss them with the walnuts, garlic, and butter in a medium mixing bowl. Add salt and pepper. You will need at least 1½ teaspoons of salt. Stir until everything is combined and the butter has softened and is evenly distributed throughout. Puree the mixture in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, until smooth and creamy, 3 to 4 minutes. You should have a thick bean puree or paste. In a small mixing bowl, mix the herbs together and then blend half of them into the beans. Spread the puree ¼ to ½ inch thick onto a small baking sheet, lined with plastic wrap. Cool completely at room temperature, for at least 30 minutes. Sprinkle the puree generously with the ¼ cup pomegranate seeds and remaining fresh herbs, and then roll the puree into a log from one end to the other, using the plastic wrap to help roll. Wrap the log tightly in plastic wrap and chill it again for 2 hours or overnight. Cut the log into ½-to 1-inch-thtck slices and garnish with walnuts and pomegranate seeds.
