Place all the ingredients in a stockpot or large pot over high heat and bring to a boil, skimming the top. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer 2 to 2Â½ hours, skimming occasionally, until a good chicken flavor is achieved. Strain through a fine strainer, pushing down on the solids to extract all the liquid, and skim any grease off the top. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until the fat solidifies, and lift it off the soup. Refrigerate up to 1 week. After 3 days, bring to a boil. Then boil, skim, and cool every 2 days; or freeze.
