Preheat oven to 375Â°F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the shortening, sugars, applesauce, and vanilla until smooth. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt with a wire whisk. Add the flour mixture to the shortening mixture, and stir until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips. Use a cookie scooper to place the batter onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool completely on the baking sheet.
