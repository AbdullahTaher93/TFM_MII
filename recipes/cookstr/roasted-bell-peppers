Position a rack about 7 inches from the heat source, and preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Flatten each pepper half slightly with the palm of your hand. Lay the peppers, skin side up, in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Broil until the skins are charred (but not too crisp), 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a plastic or paper bag, close it, and let them steam in the bag for 15 to 20 minutes. Slip off the charred skins and use the peppers as directed in the recipe. Or if you are storing them, drizzle the peppers lightly with olive oil, place them in an airtight container, and refrigerate for up to 10 days.
