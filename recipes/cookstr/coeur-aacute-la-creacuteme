Mix the cottage cheese, cream, confectioner's sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Fold into the cheese mixture. Fill 4 individual coeur á la créme molds with the mixture and cover with plastic wrap. Place the molds on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Place the molds and tray in the refrigerator and allow to drain for 2–3 days. To serve, carefully unmold the crémes onto plates. Drizzle with more cream, garnish with the berries and serve chilled.
