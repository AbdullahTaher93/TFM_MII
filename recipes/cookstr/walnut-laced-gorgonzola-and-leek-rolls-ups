Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) Filling: In a skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Sauté leeks until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a food processor fitted with metal blade. Add Gorgonzola, cream, Parmesan and walnuts and process until smooth, stopping and scraping down sides of the bowl as necessary, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Set aside. On a work surface, cut phyllo sheets in half crosswise to form 6 sheets. Working quickly, brush each sheet with melted butter, stacking them on top of each other. When all 6 sheets are in place, arrange with one long end closest to you. Spread filling evenly over the top, leaving about a 1-inch (2.5 cm) border on long end farthest away from you. Beginning with the long end closest to you, roll up jelly-roll fashion to form a log. Using a sharp knife, score into 12 slices across the log, approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Brush top with melted butter. Place on prepared sheet and bake in preheated oven until light golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Slice along scored marks and serve warm.
