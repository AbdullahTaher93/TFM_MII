The goal here is for the pasta and the sauteed vegetables to be done at about the same time. You need to manage both a pot of water for the asparagus and the pasta, and a large skillet or other heavy pan for sauteing the vegetables, First, prep the vegetables and grate the cheese, and while youâ€™re doing that, put a large covered pot of salted water on to boil and cook the asparagus. Break off and discard the tough ends of the asparagus spears and cut them into 2-inch pieces. When the water is at a boil, cook the asparagus for a minute or two until vivid green and barely tender. Remove the asparagus with a slotted spoon and set aside. Keep the water boiling to be ready for the pasta. In a large skillet or pan on medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the garlic, red onions, and carrot sticks. Saute for a minute or two, stirring frequently. Stir the pasta into the pot of boiling water, and cook. Add the bell peppers and zucchini to the skillet and continue to saute for a few minutes. Add the cooked asparagus and the tomatoes and wine, which will quickly bubble and steam. Add the salt and finish cooking the vegetables until just tender. Stir in the peas and basil. If you are using frozen peas rinse them with boiling water before adding. Season with black pepper and add more salt to taste, When the pasta is al dente. drain it, reserving about 1/4 cup of the cooking water. In a large serving bowl, toss the pasta with about half of the grated cheese and the reserved cooking water. Drizzle the pasta with a little olive oil if you like. Top the pasta with the vegetables, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese, and serve right away.
