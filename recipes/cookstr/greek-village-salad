Place the peppers, cucumber, onion, tomatoes, olives, capers, if using, and cheese in a large bowl. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, then with the oil. Add the lemon juice, if using. Crumble the oregano over the top, toss gently, and serve. VARIATION: The Greek-American Rendition: As a horiatiki salad depends on good fresh produce, Greek Americans were faced with a quandary. American tomatoes are often picked well before ripening and are decidedly pale in comparison to their Greek counterparts. Besides, Americans had a fixed notion that salad means lettuce, and supermarket vegetable sections almost always have some crisp fresh lettuce available to accommodate that notion. Ever adaptable, Greeks in the States altered their village salad to include lettuce. In addition, scallions are often substituted for bulb onions. As the new version traveled west, the salad picked a new appellation. In a nod to its origin, it is often called not a village salad, but a “Greek” salad. To make the Greek-American version, add 3 cups romaine, red lettuce, baby spinach, or arugula, and reduce the amount of the other vegetables accordingly. Substitute 6 scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths, for the red or white onion.
