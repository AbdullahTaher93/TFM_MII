Place the tuna steaks in a shallow dish or bowl, season with salt and pepper to taste, and drizzle generously with oil. Toss with all the citrus zest and let sit 30 minutes at room temperature or up to 6 hours refrigerated. Make the dressing by whisking together all the ingredients in a small bowl. Toss the salad ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Heat a skillet over high heat for couple of minutes. Shake the excess marinade from the tuna steaks and sear the tuna until nicely browned on both sides but still rare in the middle, about 4 minutes per side. Toss the salad with the dressing. Place a slice of toasted bread on a dinner plate and top with the tossed salad. Slice the tuna steaks thinly and layover the salad.
