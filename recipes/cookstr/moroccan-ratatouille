Sprinkle the eggplants with salt and leave for I hour to draw out their juices, then rinse and dry them. Very briefly shallow-fry the eggplants and zucchini separately in hot oil until lightly browned, then drain on paper towels. Fry the onion and pepper over gentle heat in 3 tablespoons of oil till the onion is golden and the pepper is soft. Make a tomato sauce: fry the garlic in 2 tablespoons of oil till golden. Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper, and sugar and simmer about 20 minutes, until reduced to a thick sauce. Stir in the fried vegetables and the flat-leafed parsley and take off the heat. This can be eaten hot or cold. Variation: When it is to be eaten cold, it is sometimes made with a few sprigs of fresh mint (chopped) or I tablespoon dried mint, and some black olives may be added.
