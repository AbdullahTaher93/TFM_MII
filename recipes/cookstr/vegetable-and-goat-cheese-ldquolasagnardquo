Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the eggplant slices in a colander and sprinkle well with salt. Let sit 1 hour. Toast the pine nuts in the oven for 3–4 minutes, or until lightly golden. Reserve. Raise the oven temperature to 375°F. Place the arugula, watercress, and salt in a food processor and purée, adding a little water if necessary. Beat in the 6 tablespoons oil, the vinegar, sugar, and pepper. Taste for salt. In a greased baking dish, about 8 × 11 inches, preferably Pyrex, place 8 of the zucchini slices in a single layer. Cover each with cheese, and sprinkle with the paprika. Cover with a single row of tomatoes, then dot with a few capers. Pat the eggplants dry and continue layering with an eggplant slice, garlic, mushrooms, and piquillos. Sprinkle the layered vegetables with the pine nuts and basil, add another layer of eggplant, and end with a second layer of zucchini. Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with the grated cheese and parsley [May be made ahead]. Bake about 25 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. To serve, spoon a tablespoon or so of the purée onto 8 individual plates and top each with a “lasagna.”
