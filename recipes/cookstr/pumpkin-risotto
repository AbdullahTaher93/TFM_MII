For the risotto: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the pumpkin, celery, onion, and carrot and sauté until softened but not colored, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and sauté 1 minute. Add the stock to the rice ¼ cup at a time, not adding more until the previous addition has been absorbed. Add the carrot juice the same way. When all the liquid has been absorbed, the risotto should be al dente; add more liquid if necessary and cook until the grains are tender, with slightly hard centers, and the sauce is creamy. To serve: Stir in the Parmesan cheese and parsley and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Serve immediately. Variation: For the pumpkin, substitute an equal amount of butternut squash (it will have a slightly stronger flavor).
