To make the buttermilk dressing, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, and buttermilk in a bowl. Add the dill, chives, garlic, shallot, and lemon juice and whisk again. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta, and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta and immediately run under cold water until it is completely cool. Drain well. Put the pasta in a large bowl and, using a rubber spatula, fold in enough dressing to coat it generously. Fold in the scallion, cheese, and m√¢che. Mound the salad on a large platter and serve.
