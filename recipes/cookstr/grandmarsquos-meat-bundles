In a skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil, add the prosciutto and onion, and saute until the onion is soft and the prosciutto begins to brown. Add the bread crumbs and continue sauteing until the crumbs pick up the excess oil. Add the walnuts and raisins, and blend, cooking about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the cheese, sage leaves, and egg, and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside. Trim the pork pieces of any visible fat, then pound with a meat hammer until no more than .25 inch thick, at least 4 inches wide, and 5 inches long. Divide the filling among the pork pieces, spreading it evenly. Roll up each piece like a jelly roll and tie with string or hold in place with toothpicks. Place some flour on a plate and roll the meat bundles in it, shaking off the excess. Set the bundles aside. Wipe out the skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and brown the meat bundles well on all sides. Transfer the rolls to a warm platter. Turn the heat to high, scrape up any of the meat bits that have clung to the pan, and add the wine and water. Cook, stirring until it boils, then remove from the heat, add the butter, and beat with a whisk until the sauce has thickened a little. Pour the sauce over the rolls and serve immediately.
