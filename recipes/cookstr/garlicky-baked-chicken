Rub the paprika, salt, and pepper well into the chicken pieces. In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, oil, and lemon juice. Put the chicken in a glass or ceramic roasting pan and pour the marinade over it. Turn the chicken with tongs to coat it completely, then cover and refrigerate overnight. Bring to room temperature before baking. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Sprinkle the chicken with oregano. Put the uncovered roasting pan with the chicken in the oven and roast for 40 minutes, turning the pieces once. Serve on a bed of watercress.
