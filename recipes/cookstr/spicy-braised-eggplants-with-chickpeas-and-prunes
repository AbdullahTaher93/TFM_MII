1 Toss the eggplant cubes in the vegetable oil in a shallow baking pan and place in a single layer under a preheated broiler until lightly charredâ€”this should take 10-15 minutes and they will need turning and shaking occasionally. 2 Heat the sesame oil in a large wok, then add the garlic, ginger, and scallions and cook for 5 minutes, turning regularly. Add the eggplant to the pan, along with the chickpeas, broth, and soy sauce and bring to a boil. 3 Add the prunes and cook for another 10 minutes. Add the cornstarch and stir to thicken. Pour the mixture into a dish and sprinkle with the cilantro and chile.
