Grate the cheese, or if you’re feeling too lazy to take out the grater (as I always am), cut the cheese into paper-thin slices or into cubes no larger than ½ inch. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Whisk the milk and cornstarch together in a medium-size saucepan (not aluminum or iron) and set aside. Add the macaroni to the boiling water and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. At the same time, slowly bring the milk and cornstarch to a simmer, whisking constantly, over medium heat. As the milk comes to a simmer, it will thicken. Stir three-quarters of the cheese into the sauce and reduce the heat to very low. Cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese melts. Add the remaining cheese, remove the pan from the heat, and let the remaining cheese melt. Add the Worcestershire sauce and season to taste with salt, pepper, and Tabasco. Drain the elbows thoroughly and toss them with the sauce before serving or simply ladle the sauce over the pasta. Serve immediately. Variation To turn this into a complete meal, thaw 2 packages (10 ounces each) chopped spinach. Place the thawed spinach in a strainer and squeeze out as much moisture as you can with your hands. After the milk thickens, stir in the spinach before you add the cheese and proceed as directed.
