Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Mash the butter, herbs, and garlic together. Beat the herbs and garlic into the butter. Ease your fingers between the breast skin and chicken flesh, being careful not to tear the skin. Tuck the butter under the skin. Pierce the lemon all over with a fork and place inside the body cavity. Truss with kitchen string, if desired. Season with salt and pepper. Put the chicken on a rack in the roasting pan. Pour 1½ cups of the stock and the wine over the chicken. Roast for about 1½ hours, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh, not touching a bone, reads 170°F (77°C). If the liquid evaporates from the bottom of the pan, add a little more wine. Transfer the chicken to a platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let stand for 10 minutes. Spoon off the fat from the pan. Add the remaining ½ cup stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil, stirring often, about 3 minutes, until slightly reduced. Garnish the chicken with the herb sprigs and serve hot, with the pan juices.
