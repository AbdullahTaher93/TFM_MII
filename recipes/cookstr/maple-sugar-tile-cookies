Heat the oven to 350°F. Line 2 large cookie sheets with nonstick liners. Steady a rolling pin between two bottles or cans so that it’s ready to shape the cookies. Arrange a cooling rack next to the pin for the hot cookie sheet. Put the maple sugar and the egg white in a small bowl. Whisk until blended and a bit foamy, about 1 minute. Add the warm (not hot) melted butter and whisk until blended. Add the flour and whisk until smooth. Drop the batter by a scant 1 tablespoon onto the prepared cookie sheets about 4 inches apart (I can fit 5 on a cookie sheet). Spread each round of batter into a 3½-inch circle with a small offset spatula. Bake, one sheet at a time, until the cookies are browned around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Working quickly, move the cookie sheet to the cooling rack. Using a wide metal spatula, lift off the hot cookies, one by one, and immediately drape them over the rolling pin. Let cool until set, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the cookies from the rolling pin and set them on a rack to cool completely. Serve immediately or cover and store at room temperature for up to 3 days.
