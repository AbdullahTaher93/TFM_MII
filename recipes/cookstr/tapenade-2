Put the olives, garlic, capers, and enough of the olive oil to make a paste in the container of a blender or food processor. Blend or process until smooth. Remove to a bowl. Put anchovy fillets, tuna, and their oils plus the olive oil in the container and blend to a paste. Then blend in the first mixture and the cognac to a thick pur√©e. Taste for seasoning. It will not need salt, because of the anchovies, but it may need more cognac, some freshly ground black pepper, a dash of Tabasco, or a touch of thyme or summer savory.
