Put the bouillon into a pan and keep it warm on the stove. Peel and finely chop the onion. Melt the butter in a 3-quart heavy pan and gently saut√© the onion for five minutes, until soft but not yet beginning to color. Stir the rice into the onions, mix thoroughly and cook for about five minutes, stirring constantly, until the rice begins to look translucent. Pour in the wine and continue to stir until it is absorbed. Then begin to add the bouillon, a little at a time, stirring constantly over a low heat as the bouillon is absorbed. The process should take about 25 minutes and by the time the last of the bouillon is absorbed, the mixture should be think and the rice tender. Finely shred the cheese. Peel and dice the avocados. Put the walnut pieces into a dry, heavy pan and heat them gently, stirring frequently, until they begin to color, then turn onto a plate to stop them from cooking further. Chop the chives and parsley. When the rice is ready, gently stir in the cheese, toasted walnuts, and avocado pieces and serve immediately, garnished with the fresh herbs.
