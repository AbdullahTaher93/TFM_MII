Preheat the oven to 450°F. Trim the turnips and scrub them, but don’t peel. Trim and scrub the radishes. Arrange the vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet with a low rim. Drizzle the olive oil over them and add salt and pepper to taste. Stir well and rearrange in a single layer. Place the thyme sprigs on top of the vegetables or scatter the dried thyme over them. Roast about 45 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender, stirring from time to time. Serve hot.
