In a medium nonreactive saucepan, bring all of the ingredients to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes until most of the juices evaporate and the ketchup is thick. Cool to room temperature. Store covered in the refrigerator. (The ketchup will keep 2 to 3 weeks.) Serve as an accompaniment to Shepherdâ€™s Pie , pork roasts, and chops.
