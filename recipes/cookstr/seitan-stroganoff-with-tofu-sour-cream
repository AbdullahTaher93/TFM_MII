Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and saute for 10 minutes or until translucent. Add the seitan and the bay leaf, and continue to saute for another minute. Place the almond butter in a medium bowl. Slowly add the water while stirring to blend. Add to the skillet and mix with the seitan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and gently simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Add the mushrooms and simmer for 5 minutes more. Season with shoyu. While the ingredients simmer, place all of the sour cream ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Serve the stroganoff topped with the sour cream and garnished with parsley leaves. Variations: • Substitute tempeh or tofu for the seitan. • Instead of almond butter, use tahini. • Replace the shoyu with vegetable bouillon.
