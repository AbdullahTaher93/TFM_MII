Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the oil, then the garlic, and stir for 10 seconds. Add the spinach a handful at a time, stirring and adding more as it wilts in the pan. When all the spinach has been added, season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly, until all the spinach is wilted. Add the cream and simmer 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the cream has been absorbed and reduced almost entirely. Set the pan aside to cool. (If making the day before, transfer the spinach to an airtight container and refrigerate overnight.) Stir the breadcrumbs and Parmesan together in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, and set aside (or refrigerate overnight). Preheat the broiler on high heat. Fill a rimmed baking sheet with a layer of kosher salt about Â½ inch deep and arrange the baking sheet about 3 inches from the heating element. Nestle the curved part of the oyster shells into the salt. Divide the spinach mixture between the 12 shells. Top each pile of spinach with a raw oyster, then sprinkle each oyster with a tablespoon of the breadcrumb mixture. Dot each oyster with a tiny piece of butter, and broil for about 3 minutes, rotating the pan if necessary, or until the breadcrumbs are evenly browned, the oysters are cooked, and the spinach is warmed through. Serve immediately. Variations: Substitute sea scallops for the oysters. Use scallop shells (available in fish shops) and broil about 4 minutes, depending on the size of the scallops, or until just cooked through. Substitute raw clams for the oysters and broil for 2 to 3 minutes.
