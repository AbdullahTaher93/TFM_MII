For the ribs For the ribs The first step, cooking the ribs, needs to happen at least one day before the barbecue. To begin, season the ribs generously with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 250°F. Place the ribs in a roasting pan deep enough to hold them all, and add just enough canola oil to cover them completely. Bake slowly for 3 to 4 hours, checking periodically to make sure the oil is hot but not boiling. Adjust heat if needed. When the meat starts to pull away, leaving a clean bone at the bottom of the rib, remove the pan from the oven and allow to cool completely. Cover the pan with foil and put the whole works in the fridge. The ribs will keep for several days, as long as the oil is completely covering them. On the day of the barbecue, an hour before serving, take the pan out of the fridge and place in a 225°F oven for 10 minutes to make the ribs easier to remove from the oil. Transfer the ribs to a colander set over a platter and drain off any excess oil. For the sauce (which can be made several days in advance) Combine all of the sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Adjust the seasoning, adding more spices, more honey, or more vinegar to suit your taste. To grill To grill
