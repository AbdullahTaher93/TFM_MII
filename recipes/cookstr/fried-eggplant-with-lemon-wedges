Prepare two shallow dishes, one for eggs and one for flour. Coat eggplant slices first with flour, then with egg. Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Cook eggplant slices 2 minutes or until brown, turn over, and continue cooking until other side is brown and soft. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate to drain off excess oil; keep warm until all eggplant slices are cooked, adding more oil as needed. Place slices on serving plate, season with salt and pepper, and garnish with lemon wedges.
