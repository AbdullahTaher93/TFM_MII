Slice onion into 1-inch chunks and arrange on wood or metal skewers. Grill over hot coals 4 minutes on each side; set aside. Grill steak 4 to 6 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness (150° to 160°F for medium); slice into thin strips. Divide hearts of romaine among four dinner plates. Arrange tomatoes and steak over lettuce. Top with grilled onion. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar (the steak will provide the oil). Sprinkle with pepper and cheese.
