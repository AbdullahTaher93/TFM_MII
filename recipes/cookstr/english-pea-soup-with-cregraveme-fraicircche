Place the peas in a large bowl of ice water. In a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and carrot and cook over medium-low heat until the vegetables are wilted and the onions are transparent, about 5 minutes. Add the water and salt and bring to a boil. Fill a large bowl half-way with ice water and place a slightly smaller bowl in it. You will use this to chill the soup immediately after it has cooked. When the water is boiling, remove the peas from the ice water, add them to the soup, and cook for 1 minute. Immediately pour the soup into the bowl set into the ice bath. Stir until cool. When the soup is completely cool, place it in a blender and puree until smooth pour the soup back into the saucepan, heat to simmer and add salt and pepper to taste. Pour into individual soup bowls. Place 1 tablespoon of crème fraîche in the center of each bowl and serve immediately.
