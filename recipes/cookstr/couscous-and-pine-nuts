In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Stir in the couscous and remove from the heat. Cover and let stand until the couscous is tender and the broth is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Add the green onions, pine nuts, parsley, mint (if using), and butter. Season with the salt and pepper and fluff with a fork. Serve immediately, or keep warm in a pan over hot water until ready to serve.
