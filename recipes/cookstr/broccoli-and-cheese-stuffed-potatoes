Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) Bake or microwave potatoes as directed. In a saucepan cook or steam broccoli until just crisp tender. (Or place in covered casserole and microwave at high for 3 minutes.) Drain well. Cut a thin slice from tops of warm potatoes. Scoop out potato leaving a ¼-inch (5 mm) shell, being careful not to tear the skins. In a bowl mash potato with potato masher or fork; beat in enough sour cream until smooth. Add broccoli, onion and 1 cup (250 ml) of the cheese. Season with salt and a dash of cayenne pepper to taste. Spoon filling into potato shells, mounding the tops. Arrange in shallow baking dish; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until cheese melts. Or place on a rack and microwave at Medium-high for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through and cheese melts. To freeze: Cool. Wrap individually in plastic wrap, then in foil freeze for up to 2 months. To serve: Thaw in refrigerator overnight. Unwrap and bake in a preheated 350°F (180°C) oven for about 20 minutes or until heated through. From Johanna Burkhard: The Comfort Food Cookbook
