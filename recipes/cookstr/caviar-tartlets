Preheat the oven to 375°F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry with a floured rolling pin to 1/8 inch thick. Use a 2-inch cookie cutter or a drinking glass to cut out 24 circles from the pastry. You may have to gather up the scraps and roll out the pastry again. Press each circle into a cup of a small-cup (1½-inch size) muffin tin. Prick the bottoms of the tartlet shells with a fork, line each with aluminum foil, and fill with dried beans, pie weights, or rice. Bake until the edges are golden and the shells are baked through, about 15 minutes. (If they are not baked properly, remove the foil and pie weights, and bake for 5 minutes more. Cool completely and remove from the tins. In a small bowl, mix together the crème fraîche, lemon juice, and dill. Spoon about ½ teaspoon of the crème fraîche mixture into each tartlet. Top with some caviar and garnish with a dill sprig.
