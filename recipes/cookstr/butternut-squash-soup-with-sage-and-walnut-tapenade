Place the shallot, squash, onion, and salt in a large soup pot and add water until the vegetables are just covered. Bring to a simmer, then cook 5 to 7 minutes, just until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork. Reserving the cooking water, drain the vegetables and set aside. To make the tapenade, place the walnuts, parsley, sage, and salt in a food processor and blend until the mixture appears smooth, but a little coarse. Transfer the mixture to a small mixing bowl, add the tomatoes and olive oil, and gently combine by hand. Set aside. Transfer the squash mixture to a food processor. Add the honey and cinnamon and process until smooth, adding just enough of the reserved cooking water to reach the desired soup consistency. Ladle the soup into bowls, top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of tapenade, and serve.
