Beat the eggs with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and the ground peppercorns in a medium bowl and set aside. Heat the oil with the garlic, curry leaves (if using), cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and chiles in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the cumin is fragrant and golden and the mustard seeds begin to pop, stirring often, for about 2 minutes. Add the onion, jalape√±o, and 2 teaspoons of salt, and cook for 1 minute. Add the shredded turkey, cook for 1 minute, and then mix in the tomatoes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the tomatoes release their liquid, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Increase the heat to medium-high and pour in the eggs. Mix the eggs into the turkey and vegetables and cook until the eggs begin to set, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Mix in all but 2 tablespoons of the cilantro and cook for 30 seconds longer if you like soft eggs, or 1 minute longer if your prefer medium-cooked eggs. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with the reserved cilantro, and serve.
