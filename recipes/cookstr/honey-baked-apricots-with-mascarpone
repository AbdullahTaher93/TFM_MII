Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly butter a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold the apricots. Arrange the apricots in the dish, cut sides up. Brush with the honey, then sprinkle with the almonds and a dusting of the ginger. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the apricots are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife and the almonds are toasted. Serve hot or cooled in dessert glasses, with a dollop of the mascarpone. 3.
