Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Into each prepared muffin cup, spoon 1 tsp (5 mL) frozen concentrate and ½ tsp (2 mL) sugar. Set aside. In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, pecans and orange zest. Make a well in the center. In another bowl, whisk together cranberry sauce, orange juice, lemon juice, eggs and oil. Add to flour mixture; stir quickly just until blended. Spoon batter into muffin tins. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until browned. Remove from oven; let stand for 5 minutes. Turn pans upside-down so orange mixture is on top. Spoon any remaining sauce over muffins.
