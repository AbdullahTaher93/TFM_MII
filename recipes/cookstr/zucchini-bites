Preheat broiler. Score sides of zucchini with a channel knife starting at the top of the zucchini and scraping down in 3 straight lines around the zucchini each a third of the way around, creating a design in the skin of the zucchini. Slice the zucchini in 1/4-inch slices. Mix together the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano and basil. Arrange the zucchini slices on foil covered baking sheet. Spread 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture on each slice of zucchini. Temperatures of ovens vary! It would be best for you to know how long your broiler takes to toast, so toast one with topping before toasting them all. Broil on the top rack of the oven about 2 inches from the heat. You want to be sure the mixture gets heated through and begins to turn very lightly golden indicating that the cheese is melting (about 30 seconds). Watch carefully as not to burn. Sprinkle with paprika and serve warm. The topping mixture may be made a day ahead and refrigerated until ready to use. Variations: 1/4 cup chopped kalamata olives can be added to this mixture. Chopped red pepper can be used as a garnish for a more colorful combination once they are removed from the broiler. To add spice, omit basil and use chopped jalape√±o and 1/2 cup chopped onion. Melba toast rounds can be substituted for zucchini.
