Combine shrimp, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, garlic, and rosemary; cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour. Meanwhile, broil peppers in a shallow pan, 4 inches from heat source, until evenly charred on an sides, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand 20 minutes. Working over bowl to save pepper juices, cut peppers in half and carefully lift out seeds and stems; discard. Scrape charred skins from the pepper halves; rinse peppers under running water to remove any seeds or charred skin remaining. Cut two pepper halves into 1/8-inch strips; reserve separately. Place the remaining pepper halves in a small bowl. Strain the reserved pepper juices through a sieve into the bowl with pepper halves. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet; add onion; saut√© 5 minutes. Stir in the pepper halves and the reserved juice; stir to blend. Puree in a food processor until very smooth. (Can be prepared ahead up to this point.) At serving time, cook pasta in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, or firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. While pasta is cooking, heat a medium skillet over high heat until a drop of water sizzles and evaporates immediately upon touching. Add the shrimp with their marinade. Stir-fry until shrimp are pink on both sides and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add the red pepper puree, the reserved pepper strips, and the cream to the skillet. Heat, stirring, until blended and simmering. Toss with the pasta and serve at once.
