Purèe the green peppers, onion, garlic, and ginger with 1 tbsp water in a blender. Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the mustard seeds and cook, stirring frequently, for about 30 seconds, or until they begin to pop. Pour in the onion purèe and cook, stirring often, for about 3 minutes, until the purèe is thick and fairly dry. Add the remaining 1 tbsp oil and the curry powder and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and cook for 1 minute, stirring often, then stir in the coconut milk and mix well. Add the lamb and peas and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer for about 6 minutes, until the peas are tender. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with the cilantro and serve hot.
