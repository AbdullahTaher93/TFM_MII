Place a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. When hot, add the butter and olive oil. Once the butter has melted, add the pancetta and cook until crisp. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel. Add the onion and carrot to the hot pan and saut√© for 3 minutes. Add the garlic, beef, pork and veal. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring often with a wooden spoon so that the meat breaks up into small pieces. Stir in the white wine and crushed tomatoes, then bring the sauce to a boil. Mix in the tomato paste, then add the salt, pepper, oregano, sage and red pepper flakes. Stir until all of the herbs are incorporated, then add in pancetta and stir again. Lower the heat and cover. Allow sauce to simmer for at least 30 minutes, or longer if desired.
