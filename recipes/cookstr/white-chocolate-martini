To prepare chocolate shavings, hold the chocolate bar in one hand and, using a vegetable peeler, cut shavings from a long edge of the bar–you’ll want several shavings for each drink. Set aside. If not using immediately, cover and store in the refrigerator. Fill a pitcher with ice and add the vodka and crème de cacao. Stir briskly until the outside of the pitcher is beaded with sweat and frosty. Strain into cocktail glasses, garnish with the chocolate shavings or 3 coffee beans per glass, and serve.
