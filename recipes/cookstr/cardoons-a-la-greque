Trim the cardoons as you would celery. Scrape the ribbed side of each stalk with a sharp knife to remove strings and any brown skin. Cut them into Â¼-inch-thick slices, dropping the slices in a bowl of cold water. Combine the water, milk, salt, and sugar in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the sliced cardoons, and simmer for 15 minutes. Rinse under cold water and drain. Stir the dressing ingredients together in a large bowl. Toss the cardoons with the dressing. Let the mixture stand for several hours, loosely covered, at room temperature, stirring occasionally. Serve as a side dish or appetizer, scooping up the cardoons with a slotted spoon.
