Combine all the ingredients in a large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Continue simmering, uncovered, until richly flavored, 5 minutes, stirring or whisking to prevent scorching. Use right away or transfer to jars, cover, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for several months.
