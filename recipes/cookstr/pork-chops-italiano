Early in the day place the pork chops in a shallow glass dish large enough to hold them in a single layer. Pour the cider and olive oil over them and sprinkle evenly with the juniper. Mince 1 clove of the garlic and sprinkle over the meat. Cut the remaining garlic clove into 6 slivers and insert a sliver into the meat near the bone of each pork chop. Sprinkle with the rosemary and fennel; season with salt and pepper. Let marinate covered in the refrigerator several hours, turning the chops occasionally. Prepare the fireplace or grill for cooking. Bring the pork chops to room temperature. Grill the chops about 4 inches above the hot coals, basting occasionally with the marinade and turning once, until cooked through, 25 minutes. Serve at once.
