Heat oven to 325 degrees. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the lamb shanks with salt and pepper; coat in flour, shaking off the excess. Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil to the hot pan; add 2 of the lamb shanks. Brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove; set aside. Repeat with remaining 2 shanks. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to the pan if needed. Add the onion, carrot and celery; cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic; cook 1 minute. Add the wine, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Cook until wine almost disappears, about 5 minutes. Return the lamb shanks to the pan; pour in enough of the beef broth to come halfway up the sides of the shanks. Add the bay leaves, thyme and parsley. Heat to a simmer; cover. Place the pan in the oven. Braise, turning the lamb shanks over in the sauce every 30 minutes, until the shanks are tender and meat can be pulled easily from the bone, about 11/2-2 hours. Remove shanks to a platter. Strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve into a clean saucepan; discard the solids. Heat sauce over medium-high heat. To thicken the sauce, if desired, mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold liquid: broth, water or wine. Stir half the mixture slowly into the boiling sauce; add remaining mixture if needed. Adjust seasoning. Return the shanks to the sauce to warm the meat, about 3 minutes.
