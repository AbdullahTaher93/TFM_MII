Roll the limes on a work surface, pressing hard to bruise them slightly so they release more juice. Halve and squeeze 6 of the limes; you should have about ¾ cup juice. Halve the remaining 2 limes. In a blender, combine the lime halves, lime juice, cachaça, and sugar. Blend until the lime halves are pureed, about 1 minute. Pour the mixture into glasses filled with crushed ice, and serve immediately.
