Spray the inside of the crock with nonstick cooking spray. Layer the squash and apple rings in the bottom. Place the turkey thighs on top and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and the shallot. In a small bowl, combine the apple juice, Calvados, brown sugar, cinnamon, and allspice; pour over the turkey. Cover and cook on LOW for 5½ to 6½ hours, until the meat is tender. Serve immediately.
