In a large non-aluminum saucepan, combine the tomatoes with the reserved juices, the basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook over moderate heat for about 20 minutes, or until the liquid begins to thicken. Puree the tomatoes in a food processor or food mill. Fold in the reduced cream. Strain to remove any seeds. Check the seasonings and serve hot. In summer, serve with a few ribbons of fresh basil.
