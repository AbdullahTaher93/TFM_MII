Chop the chicken into pieces of 1½ inches or less. Brown them with the vegetables in hot fat or oil. Pour out the browning fat. Add the liquid, the herbs, and enough water to cover the chicken by ½ inch. Simmer partially covered for 1½ hours or more, skimming as necessary. Strain, degrease, and the stock is ready to use.
