Preheat the oven to 250Â°F. Cut the nectarines in half, discard the pits, and place the fruit in a medium bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Pour half of the mixture over the nectarines and fold together gently to coat. Add the remaining juice mixture and the basil and combine. Arrange the nectarines in a roasting pan, cut side down, and top with the juice. Roast for 20 minutes, flip the nectarines, sprinkle with turbinado sugar, and roast an additional 20 minutes. Flip the nectarines a second time and roast until the flesh gives to the touch, 10 to 20 minutes. Let the nectarines sit in their own juices until cool to the touch. To serve: Great alone, with a scoop of gelato, or on the Grilled Lemon Pound Cake with Lemon Glaze.
