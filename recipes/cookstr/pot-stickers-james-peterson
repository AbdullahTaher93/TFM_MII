Making the Dipping Sauce: Combine all the sauce ingredients and let sit in the refrigerator for an hour or longer. (The sauce will keep for at least a week, tightly covered.) Making the Dumpling Filling: In a food processor, combine the bacon, shrimp, scallions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil and purée for 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and purée 30 seconds more. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Soak the bread in the milk for 5 minutes and work it with your fingers until you have a wet paste; stir this into the shrimp mixture. Reserve, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator. Making the Dumplings: When working with wonton wrappers, keep them tightly wrapped when not in use to prevent them from drying out. Place 1½ teaspoons of the shrimp mixture in the center of each wrapper. Brush around the mound with water and bring the sides of the circle up around the mound and pinch together. At this point you can place the dumplings on a sheet pan and freeze them. Finishing and Serving: Bring about 6 quarts of water to a boil, add the dumplings, and regulate the heat to maintain a gentle simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon or spider utensil onto a flat surface (not paper towels, which will stick). Working in batches of 24 or more—depending on the size of your pans—heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat in a nonstick sauté pan. Heat the dumplings over medium heat until golden brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes if the dumplings just came out of the water, or 5 to 6 minutes if the dumplings started out cold. Serve with the dipping sauce.
