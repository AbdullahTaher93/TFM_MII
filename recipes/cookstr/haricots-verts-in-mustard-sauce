Bring a saucepan of water to a boil, and add the green beans. Reduce the heat and simmer 3 to 5 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water, and pat dry. Set aside. Melt the butter in a medium-size saucepan, and add the shallots. SautÃ© over medium heat for 3 minutes. Stir in the stock, cream, and mustard, and cook until the mixture is just slightly thickened, 5 minutes. Then add the beans and toss them in the sauce until well coated and heated through, 2 minutes. Season the beans with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
