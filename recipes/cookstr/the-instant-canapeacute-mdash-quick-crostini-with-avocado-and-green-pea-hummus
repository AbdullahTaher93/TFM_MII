Spoon out the flesh of the avocado and put it in a food processor; add the lime juice and the garlic. Add the drained peas and salt and then process until you have a Kermit-colored puree. Spread the pumpernickel rounds softly with the avocado and pea mixture and arrange on a large platter for serving.
