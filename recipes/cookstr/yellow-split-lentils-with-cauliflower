Place the lentils in a cooking vessel and dry roast them for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly, until the lentils smell toasty and fragrant and darken a few shades. Put the roasted lentils, 2 cups of water, turmeric, cayenne pepper powder, and salt in a pot and cook for 10 minutes. Add the cauliflower and cook till it is soft, about another 5 to 7 minutes. (The lentils should now have a nice soft consistency and the cauliflower should be cooked through.) Heat the oil and ghee in a small skillet on medium heat until almost smoking and then add the cumin seeds and bay leaves. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes until the cumin sizzles and darkens along with the bay leaves. The spices should turn fragrant but not be too hot. Pour over the lentils and mix in and enjoy with rice and any other dish of your choice.
