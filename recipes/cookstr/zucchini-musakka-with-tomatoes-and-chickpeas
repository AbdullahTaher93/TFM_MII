Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. In a large bowl, combine 6 cups water and 2 tablespoons kosher salt and stir until dissolved. Add the zucchini and soak for 15 minutes. (This ensures that the skin will remain green and the white flesh will remain crisp during cooking.) Drain and pat dry, pressing gently to remove as much moisture as possible. 3 In the guvec, heat half of the olive oil with the lamb over medium-low heat. When everything is hot, raise the heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until the meat loses its redness, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes and the pepper paste into the meat. Add the zucchini and cook, stirring, until well coated with the tomato. Stir in the chickpeas and season with salt and pepper. Mix the garlic and lemon juice to a smooth paste and brush over the contents of the guvec. Quickly heat the remaining olive oil in a small conventional skillet. Add the crushed mint; stir for an instant. Sprinkle over the vegetables. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Serve at room temperature with an accompanying bowl of yogurt mixed with the chopped parsley.
