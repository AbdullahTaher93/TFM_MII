Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large casserole or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Season the brisket generously with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil over high heat. Add the brisket and cook, turning, until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Put the brisket in the casserole, fat side up, on top of the onions. Add the tomatoes and their juices, wine, celery, bay leaf, rosemary, and oregano. Cover the casserole and bake 2½ hours, basting with the pan juices and turning the meat occasionally. Add the carrots and parsley and continue baking, uncovered, until the carrots are tender, about 30 minutes. Let the brisket cool in the pan, then cover and refrigerate. (The brisket will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.) About 1 hour before serving, preheat the oven to 350°F. Transfer the brisket to a shallow roasting pan or baking dish and spoon the juices and vegetables on top. Cover tightly with foil and bake until heated through, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the horseradish sauce. Whip the heavy cream in a bowl until it forms soft peaks. In another bowl, combine the mayonnaise, horseradish, and mustard. Add the sugar and salt and pepper to taste and stir well. Fold the horseradish mixture into the whipped cream until blended. The sauce will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for 3 hours. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and slice across the grain into ¼-inch slices. Arrange the meat and vegetables on a platter, drizzle with the juices, and serve with the horseradish sauce on the side.
