Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Combine sweet potatoes, boiling potatoes, carrots, prunes, brown sugar, and cinnamon, if using, in a large saucepan. Add 1 quart water and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook over low heat 25 to 30 minutes or until vegetables and prunes are tender. Mix cornstarch with 1/3 cup water. Add to simmering liquid, stirring gently. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring gently, until sauce comes to a simmer and thickens. Season it with salt and more brown sugar, if desired. Spoon mixture into a lightly oiled 2-quart casserole dish. Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until bubbling.
