Cook the potatoes whole and leave them to get cold, and then dice them into 3–4cm cubes when you come to cook the aloo gobi. Slice the scallions into ¼ inch rings. Cut or break the cauliflower into small florets, about 1½ inches across the top of the floret. Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the cumin and mustard seeds until they begin to pop. Add the scallions and cauliflower florets and cook over a medium to high heat until the cauliflower is scorched in places. Add ½ cup water, cover the pan either with a saucepan lid or aluminum foil and cook for 10 minutes, turning down the heat if there’s too much fizz and splutter going on inside the pan. Take off the lid, and add the other spices, along with the lemon juice, diced cooked potatoes, salt and a little pepper. Turn the pan and stir carefully to mix everything well and let it cook together for another 5–7 minutes or until the cauliflower is tender and the potatoes are heated through. Season to taste and decant to a warmed dish.
