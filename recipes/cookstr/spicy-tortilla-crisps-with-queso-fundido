Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Use 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to lightly brush the tops of the corn tortillas, then sprinkle the chile powder and salt evenly over them. Starting at either the left or right edge of a tortilla, cut a vertical strip that's about 1 inch at its widest point, at a slight angle. Moving inward, cut another long strip at a similar angle in the opposite direction. Continue zigzagging across the tortilla cutting long triangular strips that alternate between the point being downward and upward. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. You should get about 8 strips per tortilla. Arrange the strips on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast in the oven until just crisped, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside to cool. The crisps can be made a day ahead and stored in an airtight container. Shortly before serving, heat the remaining ?1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small, heavy skillet or pan, preferably cast iron, over medium heat. Add the green onions and cook, stirring often, until just tender but not browned, 2 to ?3 minutes. Add the cheeses, a small handful at a time, stirring until each addition is almost fully melted before adding the next. When all the cheese has been added, continue cooking for a minute or two undisturbed so that the mixture gets nice and bubbly. Scatter the cilantro over the queso fundido and serve right away, with the tortilla crisps alongside.
