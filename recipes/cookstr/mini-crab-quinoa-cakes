In a large bowl, whisk together salt, pepper, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon zest and lemon juice. Stir in quinoa, panko, roasted peppers, green onions and egg whites. Gently fold in crab, being careful not to break it up much. Divide crab mixture into 24 equal portions. Form each portion into a Â½-inch (1 cm) thick patty and place on a plate. Cover loosely and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, until chilled, or for up to 4 hours. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tsp (10 mL) oil over medium heat. Add 6 patties and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until golden. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining patties, adding more oil and adjusting heat as necessary between batches. Serve warm.
