Combine the meat, onion, lemon peel, eggs, tomato sauce, seasonings, and enough breadcrumbs to make a firm mixture. Form into a loaf and place on the strips of bacon in a shallow baking dish or pan. Sprinkle with additional breadcrumbs. Cover with thin slices of lemon and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Remove the lemon slices. Baste with melted butter and return to the oven for about 15 minutes to brown lightly. Serve either hot or cold.
