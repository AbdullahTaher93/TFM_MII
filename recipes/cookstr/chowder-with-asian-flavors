Bring the stock to a boil in a medium-sized pan. Cook the chopped potatoes, leeks, and baby corn in the stock with the bay leaves and mace for about 10 minutes or until tender. Add the coconut milk, the chopped smoked fish, and the lime juice. Bring the pan back to a boil and let it simmer for a minute or so. Tip in the shrimp and sweet corn and once again let it come back to a boil to heat them through. Season with the salt and then serve. Decorate each bowl with some chopped chile and pungent, leafy cilantro.
