In a large pot, bring the beans and 6 cups water to a boil over high heat, periodically skimming off the foam as it rises to the top. Add salt, reduce the heat to low, and cover the pot. Simmer until the beans are almost tender, about 40 minutes or more, depending on the beans. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large heatproof casserole over medium-high heat. Add the lamb and brown on all sides. Transfer the lamb to a plate and pour off the oil. Add the butter to the casserole and melt over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté, stirring frequently, until softened and lightly colored, about 10 minutes. Return the lamb to the casserole and add salt, ½ teaspoon hot paprika, and the stock. Simmer the lamb, covered, over low heat until tender, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Drain off the liquid from the lamb and degrease, if it seems fatty. Dilute the tomato paste in the liquid and return the mixture to the lamb. Add the beans, tomatoes and their liquid, the green bell pepper, chili pepper, garlic, 1 teaspoon sweet paprika, remaining hot paprika to taste,1 tablespoon lemon juice, pepper, and more salt if needed. Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover and place in the oven for 40 minutes. Remove from the heat, add more lemon juice, if desired, and stir in the 1/3 cup parsley. Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and sprinkle with sweet paprika and additional parsley. Serve over rice or bulgur.
