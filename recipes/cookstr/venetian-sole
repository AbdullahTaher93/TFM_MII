Season fish with salt and pepper; dip in flour to coat, and shake off excess. In a large nonstick skillet, heat Â¼ cup (50 mL) olive oil over medium-high heat; in batches, cook fish fillets for 5 minutes, turning once, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towel. With a slotted spoon, remove any bits of fish or flour from the skillet. Add a little more oil (or drain excess) so that you have 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil in skillet. Reduce heat to medium; add onions and cook for 5 minutes or until golden and soft. Add wine, wine vinegar, bay leaves, cloves and cinnamon; bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Arrange fish in single layer in baking dish; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour hot marinade over fish and let cool to room temperature. Sprinkle with raisins and pine nuts, cover with plastic wrap and marinate in refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. Serve at room temperature, sprinkled with chopped parsley, if desired.
