In a 4½-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic. Saute for 5 to 7 minutes, or until translucent. Add the parsnips and potato to the saucepan and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often. Cover the parsnips and potato with the broth, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until fork-tender. Let the soup cool slightly. Transfer the soup to a blender, process it until smooth, and return it to the saucepan, or use a hand blender directly in the saucepan. Add the milk, cream, and salt to the saucepan and stir until well blended. Cover and leave over low heat while you prepare the harissa. To prepare the harissa, combine the caraway, coriander, and cumin in an 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Roast, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes, or until fragrant. In a food processor, combine the oil, garlic, mint, salt, and chili flakes. Process until smooth. Add the roasted spices and process again until smooth. Transfer the harissa to a serving bowl. Serve the parsnip soup along with the harissa, which can be drizzled on top according to preference. Transfer the remaining harissa to an airtight container, drizzle a small amount of olive oil on top to keep it fresh, and place it in the refrigerator. The refrigerated harissa should keep for a month. Use the harissa on all kinds of veggie soups. It’s also good on steamed carrots and other cooked vegetables.
