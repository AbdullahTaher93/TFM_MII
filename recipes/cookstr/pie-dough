Place the flour, salt, and butter or lard in a mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender, fork, or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. One tablespoon at a time, toss the flour mixture with the ice water until the flour is damp and the pastry can be shaped into a ball. Form the dough into a flat, fat round shape, wrap the dough in waxed paper or plastic, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes before using. To prebake the crust: Preheat oven to 350Â°F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thick. Place the dough in a pie pan, fitting it evenly over the bottom of the pan and pressing gnetly against the inside edges. Crimp the edges or trim away excess pie dough with a sharp paring knife. Cover the dough with a sheet of foil and weigh down with aluminum baking weights or dried beans. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the weights and foil and bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to a rack to cool.
