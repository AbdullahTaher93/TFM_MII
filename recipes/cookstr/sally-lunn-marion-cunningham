Put the warm water in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar over, stir, and let stand to dissolve for 5 minutes. Add the cream, butter, and eggs. Beat briskly until the mixture is well blended. Add the salt, remaining ¼ cup sugar, and 2 cups flour. Beat vigorously until the batterlike dough is smooth. Add the remaining flour and beat again until smooth. You can easily do this by hand, or with an electric mixer. Leave the dough in the mixing bowl but gather it into a ball off the sides of the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let the dough double in bulk. This will take about 2 hours. Generously butter the pan or pans (I often make small buns, using muffin tins). Lightly flour your hands (the dough is a little sticky and “stretchy”). Then for buns, tear off pieces and fill the tins about two-thirds full; or place the dough in a loaf or tube pan. Cover and again let double in bulk: the dough should rise to the top of the tins or pans. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake the buns for about 25 minutes. A loaf will take about 40 minutes, and a large tube bread about 50 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a rack to cool.
