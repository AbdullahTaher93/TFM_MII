Soak the wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Taking each scallop in your hand, remove the small muscle on the side of the scallop. Rinse each scallop under cold water and gently pat dry. Lay each scallop flat on paper towels. In a small bowl, combine the oil, salt, garlic, and cornstarch. Brush both sides of the scallops with the marinade. Skewer a scallop slightly off center. Skewer the scallop again on the other side, again slightly off center, so the 2 skewers are parallel. Add another scallop to the same set of skewers, following the same procedure. Preheat a grill to high heat and lightly brush the grill rack with oil. Place the scallops on the grill for approximately 1 minute. Turn the scallops and grill the other side for another minute. Lightly brush the scallops with additional vegetable oil if needed to prevent sticking. If desired, serve with oyster sauce.
