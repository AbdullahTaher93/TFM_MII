Place the pancetta in a pot large enough to hold the clams. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove the pancetta with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Discard all but about 2 tablespoons of fat. Increase the heat to medium and add the garlic and shallot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 2 minutes, then add the roasted tomatoes. Cook about 1 minute. Add the wine and allow it to reduce until the pan is almost dry, about 3 minutes. Add the clams and Â¼ cup water. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the clams open, about 10 minutes. Remove the lid and stir in the greens. Cook just until the greens are wilted, about 3 minutes. Divide the clams, greens, and broth among 4 shallow bowls. Top with pancetta, drizzle with olive oil, and serve.
