In a large casserole or stew pot, put the eggplant, half of the onions, the okra, green pepper, tomato; water, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Cover and turn the heat to high, stirring occasionally. Once the vegetables are boiling vigorously, about 10 minutes, reduce the heat to low and simmer until all the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Pass the vegetables through a food mill and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a large casserole or Dutch oven, heat the peanut oil over medium-high heat. Cook the remaining onion until translucent, stirring, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Spread the pureed vegetables over the onion, then arrange the fish and shrimp on top. Bake until fish flakes and the shrimp are orange, about 30 minutes. Serve from the casserole.
