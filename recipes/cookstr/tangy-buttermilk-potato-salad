In a large pan of boiling salted water, cook the potatoes over high heat until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, rinse them in cold water, and drain them again. Set the potatoes aside to cool. Place the bell pepper, radishes, eggs, pickles, pickle juice, and scallions in a large bowl. Chop the cooled potatoes into bitesize chunks and add them to the bowl, mixing lightly. In a blender, combine the dressing ingredients. Pour about ¾ of the dressing over the potatoes and stir together until well blended Add more dressing to taste, or a little more salt to adjust the salad to your liking. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours or, even better, overnight. Serve cold. The salad keeps well for several days. Variation: Hot and Spicy Buttermilk Potato Salad If you can find a “hot and spicy” variety of sweet pickles try them in the salad for extra punch. Otherwise, add a minced serrano or jalapeño or two to the salad when you add the green bell pepper.
