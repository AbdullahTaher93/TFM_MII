Cover the rice with boiling water and leave to soak for 20 minutes. Mix the meats together well in a large bowl. Put the remaining meatball ingredients, except the chicharròn, in the blender jar and blend until smooth. Add this to the meats with the crumbled chicharròn and work, preferably with your hands, until all the ingredients are well incorporated. Set aside to season while you prepare the broth. Put the tomatoes, onion, and garlic into the blender jar and blend smooth. Heat the lard or oil in the soup pan, add the blended ingredients and cook over medium heat until reduced and seasoned-about 5 minutes. Add the broth or water and salt to taste; bring up to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and carrots and cook for 8 minutes more. Add the zucchini and continue cooking over low heat. Divide the meat mixture into 24 or 36 small balls and add to the broth with the chiles and herbs. Continue cooking over low heat until the meatballs are cooked through and the vegetables are very tender. A thin sheen of fat will cover the surface-about 45 minutes.
