Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, fat side up. Bake the ham unglazed until the thermometer reads 130°F, or until 1 hour before the ham is done. Prepare for glazing by scoring the outside fat in a diamond pattern, cutting ¼ inch deep with a sharp knife. Combine the brown sugar with the honey, syrup, or vinegar and the mustard. Mix well and spread over the outside of the ham. Stud with whole cloves set decoratively in the center of each diamond. Or if you like pineapple rings, set them in place with toothpicks, putting the cloves in the holes. Return to the oven for 1 hour to finish baking, brushing, if you wish, every 15 minutes with basting sauce. Let it rest and carve at the table.
