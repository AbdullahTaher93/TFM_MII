Place the lamb into a large nonmetallic dish. Mix the oil, lemon juice, onion, and thyme and pour over the lamb. Season with salt and pepper, cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Soak 16 wooden skewers in cold water. Drain the lamb, reserving the marinade. Preheat the broiler. Thread the lamb, shallots, tomatoes, mushrooms, and red peppers onto the skewers. Grill for about 10 minutes, turning frequently and basting with the marinade. Serve hot, with warmed pita bread and the lettuce and cucumber slices. Variation Curried Lamb Kebabs Add crushed garlic, chopped cilantro, and 1 tsp each of ground cumin and curry powder.
