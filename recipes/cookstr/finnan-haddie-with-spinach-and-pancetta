Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Butter an ovenproof serving dish. Melt the oil and butter together in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and pancetta and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. In batches, stir in the spinach and cook until wilted. Stir in the créme fraîche and 6 tbsp of the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper and simmer until it has thickened slightly. Spoon the spinach mixture into the dish. Place the finnan haddie on top. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Mix the bread crumbs and remaining 2 tbsp Parmesan and sprinkle over the fish. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the fish is piping hot.
