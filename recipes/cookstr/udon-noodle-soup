Put the water in a very large pot with the chicken parts. Add the ginger, leeks, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, skim off the froth that rises to the top, and simmer 30 to 45 minutes partially covered. Line a colander with several layers of cheesecloth and pour the hot broth through it into a bowl. Discard the chicken bones, skin, meat, and vegetables, wash out your stockpot, and return the soup to the pot. Bring to a boil and swirl in the beaten egg whites. When the broth returns to the boil, remove from the heat, and strain it again through a colander lined with cheesecloth. Cook the noodles in boiling water until they are done. Rinse well, and place them, with the radishes, scallions, and Chinese cabbage, in individual soup bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the vegetables and serve at once.
