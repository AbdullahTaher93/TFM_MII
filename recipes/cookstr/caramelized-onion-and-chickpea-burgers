Place the chickpeas, onions, panko, garlic, cilantro, tahini, lemon juice and rosemary in a large mixing bowl and mix until well combined. Divide the mixture into 4 portions and form each into a patty about Â¾ to 1 inch thick, tossing it back and forth between your hands. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Sprinkle the patties with the salt and pepper. Place a cast iron skillet over high heat and when it is hot but not smoking add the burgers to the dry pan. Cook until well seared on both sides and heated throughout, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately, garnished with lemon quarters.
