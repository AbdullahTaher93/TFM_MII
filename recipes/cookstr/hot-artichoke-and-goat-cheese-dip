In a food processor, combine the artichoke hearts, onions, garlic, mayonnaise, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, and goat cheese. Blend the ingredients, leaving some texture in the dip. Spoon the dip into a 7- or 8-inch casserole dish. (At this point you can refrigerate the dip, covered, for up to 2 days if you like.) Preheat the oven to 350°. Bake the dip, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until it is browned on top. Serve it hot with crackers, bruschetta, or chips. Variation: Try using this dip as a tart filling. Spread the uncooked mixture about ¾ inch thick on a prebaked pie shell, then top with chopped olives and parsley. Bake the tart for 10 minutes at 350°, and serve it hot.
