Preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat a deep, 9-by-13-inch baking pan with the cooking spray. Cut the corn bread into ¾-inch cubes, and spread them out on baking sheets. Toast in the oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. In a large mixing bowl, combine the corn bread cubes, dry bread cubes, and pecans. In a 10-inch sauté pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Swirl to coat the pan; then add the onion and celery. Sauté until soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the thyme, sage, and cayenne, and cook 1 minute longer. Add to the bread in the bowl. Mix in the parsley, eggs, and stock. Gently mix the oysters and their liquor into the corn bread mixture, being careful not to break up the oysters. Place the stuffing in the prepared pan and bake, uncovered, until the top is lightly browned and crusty, about 45 to 50 minutes. If you have room in your oven, bake the stuffing while the turkey is roasting. Otherwise, bake it beforehand and reheat it once the turkey is out. CRACKED-PEPPER CORN BREAD MAKES 1 PAN OF CORN BREAD, ENOUGH FOR 8 CUPS OF CUBES Preheat the oven to 425°F. Coat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or an 8-inch square baking pan with the cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, baking soda, and cracked peppercorns. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and buttermilk together until blended; then add to the dry ingredients. Stir in the bacon fat or butter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Bake until the corn bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan for to minutes; then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
