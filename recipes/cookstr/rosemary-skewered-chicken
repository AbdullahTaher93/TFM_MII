In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken, chopped rosemary, lemon zest and juice, 6 tablespoons of the oil, salt, and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. In a medium saute pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil until smoking. Sear the chicken pieces for 1 Â½ minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a platter. Remove some of the leaves from the end of each rosemary sprig, then insert the sprig (or a toothpick) into each chunk of chicken.
