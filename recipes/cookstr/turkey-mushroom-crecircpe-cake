Prepare the crêpes. To make the Mornay sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, add the flour, and cook, stirring, until the mixture is bubbly, about 1 minute. Add the milk, broth, salt and pepper to taste, and nutmeg and whisk until the sauce thickens and comes to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the Gruyère. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter and sauté the shallots for 1 minute, or until translucent. Add the mushrooms and sauté for 2 minutes, or until soft. Reserve 1/3 cup of the Mornay sauce for topping. Mix the mushrooms, turkey, and parsley into the pan with the remaining sauce. Place a crêpe in a greased 9-inch pie pan and cover it with 2/3 cup of the filling. Cover with a second crêpe and repeat filling, stacking, and layering the remaining crêpes. Leave the top crêpe unfilled; spread the reserved Mornay sauce over it and sprinkle with the remaining ¼ cup Gruyere. If desired, cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Allow refrigerated crêpe cake to come to room temperature before baking. To bake, preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until heated through. Cut into wedges and serve at once.
