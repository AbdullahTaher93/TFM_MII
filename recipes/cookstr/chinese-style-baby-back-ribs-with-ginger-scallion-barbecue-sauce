Build a small fire in one half of a covered grill. Let the fuel become completely engulfed in flames, then wait a few minutes for the fire to bum down somewhat. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, pepper, and five-spice powder and mix well. Generously coat the ribs with this mixture and place them on the half of the grill without the fire under it. Put the cover on the cooker and vent slightly. Cook for 45 minutes, feeding the fire once in the middle of this period to keep it going. Flip the ribs and cook them an additional 45 minutes, again feeding the fire once. To check for doneness cut into one of the ribs; there should be no pink in the center. While you are cooking the ribs, make the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine all of the ingredients except the scallions and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by about one half; it should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove the sauce from the heat, cool for a few minutes, and stir in the scallions. Remove the ribs from the fire and serve brushed with the sauce, or with the sauce on the side for dipping.
