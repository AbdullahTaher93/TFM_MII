To Make the Filling: Heat the water and oil in a heavy pot and add the onions, garlic, curry powder and hot pepper sauce. Cook at low heat until the onions are soft. Add the cooked potatoes and canned chickpeas with juice and cook for 30 minutes. Cool and put in the fridge overnight. To Make the Roti: The next day, reheat the filling and place Â½ cup (125 mL) in the middle of each roti. Fold one side over the mixture, then the other. Fold ends toward the center to make a neat package. Turn it over on the plate so the folds are underneath. Microwave on high for 3 to 4 minutes, or heat in a hot oven for 30 minutes. Serve with Cucumbers in Yogurt. To Make the Cucumbers in Yogurt: Combine all ingredients in a bowl.
