Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the anchovies and let them dissolve in the oil for a minute. Add the chilis, capers, garlic, and olives. Stir and cook for about a minute. Drain the liquid from the tomatoes into the saucepan. Coarsely chop the tomatoes or squeeze with your hand into the saucepan. Stir to heat through, season with black pepper, and lower the heat to medium. Add the oregano to the sauce by rubbing it between your hands and dropping it into the tomato mixture. Tear the basil leaves into the sauce. Stir and taste. Correct seasoning. Bring 6 quarts water to a boil. Add salt. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente, drain, and toss with a bit of the sauce to keep it from sticking. Divide the pasta onto four or more plates and dress with the rest of the sauce.
