Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil two 9 7/8- by 3 1/8-inch bread pans and line with parchment paper. Combine the brown rice flour, buckwheat flour, corn flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, water, and molasses in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until well incorporated. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared bread pans. Sprinkle the tops with seeds and bake until a knife inserted deep into the centers of the loaves comes out clean, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.
