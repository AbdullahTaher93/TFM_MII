Season the tuna lightly with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tuna and sear to your desired doneness: about 1½ minutes per side for rare, 2½ minutes per side for medium. In a large bowl, combine the prosciutto, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, olives, red bell pepper, anchovies, and greens. Add the remaining olive oil and the lemon juice and toss to coat. Pile the mixture on top of the tuna and serve.
