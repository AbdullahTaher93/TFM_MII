Heat the oven to 325Â°F. Put the cilantro, parsley, chilies, ginger, garlic, onion, ground cumin, and salt in a blender. Squeeze in the lime juice and blend the mixture to a smooth paste. Stir in the jaggery or dark brown sugar. Rub this mixture all over the chicken, taking care to enter all the cracks and crevices and well under the skin. Lightly baste with the ghee. Place the chicken in a deep baking dish and roast for about 3 to 4 hours, basting halfway through the roasting time. Remove from oven and let rest about 15 minutes. Slice into pieces and serve.
