Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Line a 7 × 11-inch baking pan with nonstick baking parchment, leaving a little hanging over the edges for easy removal later. Place the oats, seeds, coconut and flour in a large bowl and mix together. Melt the butter and corn syrup together in a saucepan, then mix in the sugar, chopped apricots, peanut butter and vanilla extract. Pour into the bowl of dry ingredients and mix until evenly combined. Press the mixture into the prepared pan and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and slightly firm. Allow to cool in the pan, then remove, still in the paper, and cut into 18 bars (or cut them whatever size you want them to be). Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. These will also freeze well.
