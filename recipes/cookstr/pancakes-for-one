Stir together all dry ingredients together in one bowl, and all wet in another. Add the wet into the dry and stir just enough to combine the two. Lightly grease a skillet and turn up the heat to medium, making sure it has time to get hot before adding you batter. When ready, ladle dollops of the batter into your skillet and allow them to sit, undisturbed for 2 or 3 minutes, until bubbles erupt along the top and the edges seem to have firmed up a bit. Flip, and cook for another 2 or 3 minutes on the other side. Move to a plate, eat, and watch your mood miraculously improve.
