Sift the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl. Add the beaten egg and enough of the milk to make a light paste. Add the jalapeno pepper, scallions, and cayenne and blend thoroughly. In a large heavy deep pot, heat at least 2 inches of the oil until it begins to smoke. Drop the batter by the tablespoonfuls into the hot fat and fry until golden.
