Place ½ cup of garlic scapes in the bottom of a clean quart jar. Top with ½ cup of basil and ½ cup of calendula flowers, ripping up their petals and daisy-like centers as you add them. Continue layering the remaining scapes, basil, and calendula, leaving about an inch of space at the top of the jar. Add enough oil to cover (still I allowing an inch of space). Using a butter knife, gently press down the ingredients to eliminate any air pockets. Put the cap on the jar, and add a label that includes the contents, date prepared, and approximate date the oil will be ready (2 to 6 weeks from the preparation date). Place the jar on a small plate and set on a windowsill. After 2 weeks, taste the oil. If stronger flavor is desired, let it continue to steep. Continue to check once a week. When the oil is ready, pour it through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a bowl, wide-mouth jar, or measuring cup. Before discarding the strained ingredients (or saving for later use), squeeze them with your hands (with or without the cheesecloth) or press them against the strainer with the back of a spoon to get every last drop of oil. Transfer the oil to a clean bottle or jar with a lid or cork, and label it with the type of oil and date. Store in a cool dry place, where it will keep for at least a year. For A Change: • Instead of garlic scapes, use garlic cloves, garlic chives, or garlic chive flowers. • Use sun-dried tomatoes or mushrooms instead of calendula flowers. • Add a chili pepper for a “spark” of flavor.
