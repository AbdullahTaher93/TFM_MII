Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 13 × 9 × 2-inch baking pan. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until al dente, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, eggs, 2 cups of the milk, the sugar, vanilla, and 1 teaspoon salt in a blender. Blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. When the noodles are done, drain them well and add them to the egg mixture. Stir in the butter, raisins, and remaining 2 cups milk. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking pan and bake until set, about 1½ hours. Allow the kugel to cool. Then spread the cherry pie filling evenly over the kugel. Cover, and bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. Cut into squares and serve hot.
