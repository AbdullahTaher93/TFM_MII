In a food processor, mix the yolks until slightly pale, about 1 minute. With the processor on, slowly drizzle in the olive oil, drop by drop, until the sauce begins to emulsify. As it thickens, add a few drops of water to loosen the texture. Continue adding oil and loosening with a bit of water. Squeeze in the lemon juice to taste, and season with salt and pepper.
