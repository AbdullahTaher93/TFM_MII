Cut the top off each pepper. Scoop out the seeds. Boil the rice in salted water for about 20 minutes, or until tender, then drain. Stir the herbs and lemon juice into the rice and season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven 325°F (160°C). Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the peppers, and cook for 2–3 minutes. Drain well and stand the peppers in an oiled baking dish. Fill each pepper with the rice mixture. Place the tops on and drizzle with oil. Pour the stock into the dish. Cover with foil, and bake for 1 hour, or until tender. Serve hot, with the cheese on the side. 3. Fill each pepper with the rice mixture.
