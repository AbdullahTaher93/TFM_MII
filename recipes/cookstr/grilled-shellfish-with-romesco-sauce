Make one of the romesco sauces, which follow. Coat a stove-top griddle or a large skillet with a teaspoon or so of oil. Heat, then sprinkle with coarse salt. Add the lobster and cook over a high heat about 10 minutes, turning occasionally. Add the shrimp, clams, and mussels and small amounts of oil as necessary to prevent the griddle or pan from scorching. Turn the shellfish occasionally and cook until the lobster and shrimp are done and the clams and mussels have opened (this will only take a few minutes). Serve with lemon wedges and pass the romesco sauce. To Make Romesco Sauce (1): Place the dried pepper and chili pepper in a saucepan with the water and vinegar. Bring to a boil, then simmer 5 minutes. Drain and cool. In a skillet, heat ¼ cup of the oil. Fry the bread slices until golden on both sides. Remove. In the same oil sauté the tomato for about 3 minutes. Place in a processor or blender the peppers, fried bread, tomatoes (including the oil in which they were cooked), almonds, garlic, the remaining ½ cup of oil, and the salt. Beat until well blended but with small pieces remaining. Let sit at room temperature until ready to use. To Make Romesco Sauce (2): Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and sauté the onion and chopped garlic until the onion is wilted. Add the tomato, pimiento, chili pepper, broth, and wine. Cover and cook 30 minutes. In a processor or blender, grind the almonds. Beat in the vinegar, the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, the salt, and the crushed garlic. Add the tomato mixture and puree until smooth. Let sit at room temperature until ready to use.
