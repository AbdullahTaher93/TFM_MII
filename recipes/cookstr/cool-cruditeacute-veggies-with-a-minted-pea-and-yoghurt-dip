Whizz the yoghurt and mint up in a food processor for half a minute or so. Add the peas and the Parmesan and whizz again – the peas will break down and the yoghurt will become green. Put into a bowl, correcting the seasoning with extra salt and pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice. When you add the lemon juice and peas to the yoghurt, quite often it splits and turns into a kind of cheese, but this is absolutely fine. It depends on the type of yoghurt you use and how acidic your lemon is. Just pour away any excess water. Usually, though, it doesn’t split and is more like a purée, but both ways are good. The best way to serve this is to put the dip into a bowl and have a big board next to it with your veggies on. And have some salt and pepper in hand in case you need it. It’s a good sociable way to start a meal.
