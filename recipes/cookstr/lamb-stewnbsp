In a large Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the lamb with salt, place it in the Dutch oven, and brown on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Add the onion, tomatoes, and cheese to the Dutch oven and mix, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any meat bits that are stuck. Add 3 cups (708 mL) of water, reduce the heat, and simmer slowly for 1Â½ hours. Season with the salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot over mashed potatoes or with simple roasted potatoes.
