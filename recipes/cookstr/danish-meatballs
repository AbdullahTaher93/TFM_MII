Mix the bread crumbs, and milk in a medium bowl and let stand 5 minutes. Mix in the egg, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add the pork, turkey, and onion and mix with your hands until combined. With lightly floured hands, shape into about 16 balls. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook, turning often, for 8â€“10 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot, with lemon wedges.
