Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Lightly oil a baking sheet. Make a deep lengthwise incision, without cutting through the skin, down the center of the cut side of each eggplant half. Place on the baking sheet, skin side up. Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the flesh is thoroughly softened and collapsing. Transfer the eggplant halves to a colander on a plate. Let stand for 15 minutes, or until they are cool enough to handle. Scoop the eggplant flesh into a food processor. Add the tahini and lemon juice with the olive oil, yogurt, and garlic, and process until smooth. Taste and adjust the tahini and lemon juice as needed, then season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with cilantro, and serve. Good with warmed pita bread, cut into strips. Prepare by hand Preheat the broiler and set the pan about 8in (20cm) from the source of heat. Broil the scored eggplant halves, cut–sides down, about 10 minutes, until thoroughly softened and collapsing. Instead of using a food processor, the ingredients can be mashed together to a paste using a large pestle and mortar or in a large bowl using a sturdy wooden spoon.
