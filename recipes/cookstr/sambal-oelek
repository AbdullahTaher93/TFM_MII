Place the chiles in a bowl, cover with hot water, and allow them to steep for 15 minutes to soften. Remove the chiles, drain, and discard the water. Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Thin the sambal with more lime juice if desired. Store in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 2 weeks.
