Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it generously. Blanch the cauliflower for about 2 minutes; it should still be crisp. With a skimmer, transfer the florets to a tray to cool quickly. Repeat with the carrots and then with the celery, cooking them just long enough to remove their raw taste; they will be cooked more later. Add the white wine vinegar to the water and blanch the mushrooms for 1 minute. (The vinegar will keep the mushrooms white.) Drain and spread the mushrooms on a tray to cool quickly. Put the cauliflower, carrots, celery, and mushrooms in a large bowl. Add the peperoncini, tuna, anchovies, olives, pickles, onions, and artichoke hearts. Toss well. Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over moderate heat. Add the garlic and saut√© until golden. Add the tomato sauce, ketchup, lemon juice, tarragon vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, and salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Add the contents of the bowl. Stir well, then cover and simmer gently until the carrots are tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool, then refrigerate.
