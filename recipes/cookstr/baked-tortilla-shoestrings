Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Place the tortillas on a cutting board and cut them into 4 to 6 pieces (4 used to be traditional for the corn tortillas and 6 for the wheat). Arrange evenly on 1 large or 2 medium baking sheets. Dip your fingertips into a small bowl of water and sprinkle the tortillas, or spray with a mister. Place the tortillas in the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Turn each piece and bake for 5 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and lightly sprinkle with whatever seasoning you wish, or shake the pieces in a bag containing the seasoning. These chips are best served warm. Freeze any remaining for reheating and serving later. 2. Dip your fingertips into a small bowl of water and sprinkle the tortillas, or spray with a mister.
