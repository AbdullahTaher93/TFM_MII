Heat oil in a large heavy skillet; sprinkle chicken livers with salt and pepper. Saut√© in hot oil, turning often until the outsides are browned but they are still pink in the center, about 3 minutes. Transfer livers to a side dish. Add the onion to the skillet; simmer in the juices until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic; cook 1 minute. Add wine; over high heat, boil wine until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Using kitchen shears, coarsely cut up the tomatoes while still in the can. Add tomatoes and sage to the skillet; heat to boiling. Cook sauce, stirring, over medium heat 10 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Coarsely chop the chicken livers; transfer livers and their juices to the sauce. Simmer briefly; stir in parsley. Toss with hot pasta and serve at once. Sprinkle with cheese, if desired.
