Place all the ijeh ingredients in a medium-size bowl and mix well. Heat 4 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat for 30 to 45 seconds, reduce the heat to medium, and drop 1 tablespoon of the zucchini mixture at a time into the hot oil. (Stir the mixture often to keep the eggs from separating from the zucchini before spooning into the skillet.) Fry 3 to 4 portions at a time until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the skillet and place on a plate covered with paper towels to drain. Fry the remaining ijeh in the same fashion, adding more oil to the skillet as needed. (Any type of ijeh may be prepared in advance and set aside at this point. To reheat, place on a baking sheet or ovenproof plate, cover with aluminum foil, and place in a preheated 350Â°F oven until sizzling. Ijeh may also be fried, frozen, and then reheated while still frozen in the same manner.) Have hot quarters of pita bread ready. Place the ijeh in the pockets and serve immediately with sliced tomatoes, ketchup, and Syrian Pickles, if desired.
