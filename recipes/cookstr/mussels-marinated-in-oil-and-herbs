Steam fresh mussels open as directed in moules à la marinière. Discard shells. Toss the mussels in a bowl with the remaining ingredients and allow them to marinate half an hour before serving. They may be served just as they are, or you may drain them and fold into them half a cup of mayonnaise. Place them in a bowl or individual shells.
