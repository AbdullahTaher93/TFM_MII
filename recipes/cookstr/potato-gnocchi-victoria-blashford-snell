Cook the whole, unpeeled potatoes in a pot of boiling water about 25 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and let cool. Peel the potatoes and mash with a potato ricer or rub through a wire sieve. Place the warm mashed potatoes on a work surface. Make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1/3 cup of the flour into the well. Mix the ingredients, using your hands, adding more flour as needed, to make a soft, but not sticky, dough that can be shaped. Do not add too much flour or the gnocchi will be heavy. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion of dough on a lightly floured work surface into a rope about ¾ in (2cm) thick. Cut into pieces 1¼ in (3cm) long. Press each piece lightly with the back of a fork to give the traditional concave shape. Transfer to a floured baking sheet. Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a gentle boil, Add the gnocchi and cook for 2 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the butter and sage in a frying pan over medium heat until the butter has melted. Add the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Drain the gnocchi and toss in the sauce. Serve immediately, garnished with sage leaves.
