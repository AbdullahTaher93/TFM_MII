Lightly beat eggs in a small bowl. Add matzo meal, salt, pepper, and baking powder and stir with a fork until smooth. Stir in chicken soup, adding enough so mixture is just firm enough to hold together in rough-shaped balls. Bring salted water to barely a simmer in a large saucepan. With wet hands, take about 1 rounded teaspoon of matzo ball mixture and roll it between your palms into a ball; mixture will be very soft. Gently drop matzo ball into simmering water. Continue making balls, wetting hands before shaping each one. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes or until firm. Cover and keep them warm in their cooking liquid until ready to serve, or refrigerate them in their liquid and reheat before serving. When serving, remove them with a slotted spoon, add them to soup bowls, and ladle hot soup over them.
