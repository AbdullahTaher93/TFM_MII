Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter a large baking sheet. Peel, core, and cut the apples into ½ in (13mm) dice. Combine in a bowl with the raisins, sugar, almonds, rum, vanilla, and lemon zest. Place a filo sheet on a work surface and brush with melted butter. Repeat with the remaining pastry sheets. Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the pastry, leaving a 1in (2cm) border. Spoon the filling over the bread crumbs. Fold in the short sides to cover about 1in (2.5cm) of the filling. Starting from a long side, roll up the pastry, tucking in the filling if it escapes. Transfer to the baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Bake for 30–40 minutes, brushing with the remaining melted butter after 20 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool on the baking sheet. Sift liberally with confectioner's sugar. Serve warm, or at room temperature.
