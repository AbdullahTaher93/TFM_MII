Rinse chicken and pat dry thoroughly. Cut into 1½-inch (4 cm) pieces. In a bowl, mix together lime juice, ginger, garlic, mustard and salt. Add chicken and toss to coat. In another bowl, mix together chickpea flour, mustard oil, yogurt, chiles and cayenne into a paste. Coat chicken evenly with mixture. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour in refrigerator, preferably 3 to 4 hours. Preheat charcoal grill, barbecue or indoor grill to medium heat. Thread chicken pieces onto metal skewers, 3 to 4 per skewer. Insert a second skewer parallel to the first, about ½ inch (1 cm) apart. Cook on well-oiled charcoal grill or indoor grill, turning once and basting with additional oil or mustard oil, until pieces are no longer pink inside and are slightly charred outside, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
