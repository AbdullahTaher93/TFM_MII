Preheat the oven to 325°F. Butter and flour a 10-inch Bundt or tube pan. To make the cheese filling: In a medium bowl, cream the cheese, granulated sugar, and vanilla until fluffy and beat in the egg. Stir in the chocolate chips and set aside. In a large bowl, beat the 2 eggs, granulated sugar, and oil and vanilla until thick and smooth. In another bowl, combine the flour, the 2/3 cup cocoa, the baking soda, and salt. Stir to blend. Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture alternately with the buttermilk or yogurt in 2 increments, and beat until smooth. Stir in the nuts. Spoon half of the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan. Carefully spoon the cheese filling over. Spoon the remaining chocolate mixture over and smooth the top. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then unmold right side up on a wire rack. Let cool completely. In a small bowl, combine the 1 teaspoon cocoa powder and the confectioners’ sugar. Dust the cake with this mixture, shaking it through a sieve. Cut the cake into slices to serve.
