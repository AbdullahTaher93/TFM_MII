Cream the sugar and butter together very well in a medium bowl. Then transfer to the top of a double boiler and cook slowly, whisking almost constantly, over simmering water, until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved. Add the cream and keep whisking for another couple of minutes, until all is very hot. Whisk a little of the sugar-cream mixture into the beaten egg, and then return it all to the double boiler, whisking like the devil as you do so (this prevents curdling). When itâ€™s all whipped in and has cooked for a couple of minutes longer, the sauce will be a translucent ivory-gold color, slightly thickened. Remove from the heat, let cool slightly, and whisk in the bourbon. Serve the sauce, still warm, over the bread pudding.
