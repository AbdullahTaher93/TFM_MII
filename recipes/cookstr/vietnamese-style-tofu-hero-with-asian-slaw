Make the tofu: Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. In a small bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients except for the tofu. Pour into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Place the tofu slabs in a single layer in the baking dish. Turn over to coat with the marinade. Bake for 20 minutes, turning the tofu over halfway through. Assemble the sandwiches: Spread half of each baguette with 1 tablespoon of the mayonnaise and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the chile oil. Layer 1 sprig of cilantro and 1 cucumber slice (cut to fit, if necessary). Place two pieces of the tofu and a spoonful of the Asian Slaw on each baguette half. Top with remaining baguette halves and cut sandwiches in half. Serve immediately. For the Asian Slaw: Place all of the ingredients in a small bowl with 1/2 cup water and toss to combine. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
