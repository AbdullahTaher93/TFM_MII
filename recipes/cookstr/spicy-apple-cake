Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. In a large bowl, combine the apples and sugar. Let sit for one hour. In a small bowl, soak the raisins in the rum. Meanwhile, butter a 10-inch cast iron skillet. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugared apples, rum-soaked raisins (with any remaining rum), oil, eggs, vanilla, and walnuts. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Add to the apple mixture and mix well. Pour into the skillet. Bake until golden brown and firm to the touch, 45 to 50 minutes.
