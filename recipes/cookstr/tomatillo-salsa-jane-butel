Pour about an inch of water into a saucepan with a lid and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, husk the tomatillos, rinse, and cut the larger ones to be the same size as the others for even cooking. Cook the tomatillos for 5 to 7 minutes, until fork-tender. Drain, reserving some of the liquid. Place the tomatillos, jalape単o, onion, and cilantro in a blender or food processor and process until pureed. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding salt and more jalape単o or cilantro, if desired. 1.
