Place the pork chunks in a heavy 6-quart pot. Salt the pork chunks and toss to coat well. Cover the pork with water and lard and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and cook partially covered until the water has reduced and the pork has rendered its lard, 1 ½, to 2 hours. At this point the water will have mostly evaporated and the pork will begin to simmer in its own fat. Raise the heat to medium and continue to cook, uncovered, checking often and turning the pork regularly until the chunks are golden brown and crispy on the outside, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the fried pork chunks with a slotted spoon and transfer to a serving platter. Drain the rendered lard (about ½, cup) and set aside. In the meantime prepare the mojo. Using a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic, salt, and black pepper to form a smooth paste. Whisk in the sour orange juice and oregano until well combined. Place the onion in a deep 12-inch skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Pour the mojo dressing over the onion and toss to coat. Cover the skillet. Heat a ½ cup of the rendered lard in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove the cover of the skillet away from your body and only enough to safely pour inside the lard in one motion then immediately cover the skillet. This should be done carefully because the liquid will bubble and spurt when it makes contact with the lard. Leave covered until the popping sound subsides, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon the onion over the pork chunks and toss to coat. Serve immediately.
