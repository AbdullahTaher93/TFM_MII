Preheat the oven to 350°F. Arrange four of the tortillas on a baking sheet. Top with equal portions of the cheese. Scatter the jalapeño slices and a sprinkling of the ground dried red chile over each. Those who can’t resist meat may want to add a bit of chorizo or bacon, but don’t overdo it. The cheese should predominate. Top with the remaining tortillas. Bake the quesadillas 12 to 15 minutes, or until the cheese melts and bubbles. Cut the double-decker tortillas into quarters. Transfer the wedges to a serving plate, and garnish with the cabbage, offering pico de gallo and crema on the side.
