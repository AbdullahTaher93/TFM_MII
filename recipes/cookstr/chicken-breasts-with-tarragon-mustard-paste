Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill on medium-high. In a bowl or baking dish large enough to hold the chicken, combine the mustard, olive oil, tarragon, and pepper. Stir to mix thoroughly. Add the chicken breasts and turn to coat on both sides. Set aside until the grill is ready. To create a cool zone, bank the coals to one side of the grill or turn off one of the burners. Oil the grill grate. Place the chicken breasts, skin side down, directly over the medium-hot fire and sear on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn and sear on the other side for 5 minutes. Move the chicken breasts to the cooler part of the grill, cover, and grill until the juices run clear when the thickest part of a chicken breast is pierced with a knife, or an instant-read thermometer registers 165Â°F, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Divide the chicken breasts among warmed plates. Serve immediately.
