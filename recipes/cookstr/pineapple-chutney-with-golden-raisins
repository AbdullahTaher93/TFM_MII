In a medium-size, heavy saucepan, combine the pineapple, onion, bell pepper, sugar, vinegar, cardamom, ginger, and raisins and let sit until very juicy, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until thickened slightly, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and let cool. Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold. Will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
