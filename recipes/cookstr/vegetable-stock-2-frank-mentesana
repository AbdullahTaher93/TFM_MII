Sauté the vegetables in the butter and olive oil in a big soup pot over high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the vegetables from sticking to the pot and burning. When the vegetables begin to soften and reduce in volume, 5–10 minutes, lower the heat to medium and continue cooking until the onions are tender and translucent, about 10 more minutes. Return the heat to high. Add the water, parsley, bay leaves, salt, and peppercorns and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer until the water no longer tastes like water—but tastes like broth—at least 2 hours. Pour the stock through a colander, being careful not to let it splash, since it will be very hot. You can use the stock right away, or cool it to room temperature before putting it in the refrigerator or the freezer.
