Place the flour, salt, and sugar in a dishpan or large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, butter, yeast, and water. Mix it all together with your fingers, adding more flour a little at a time, until the dough is easy to handle. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Spread a little oil on the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add the ball of dough, then turn it over, oiled side up. Cover and set in a warm spot for an hour or more, until the dough doubles in bulk. Punch down the risen dough and knead for a minute or so. Cover and set in a warm spot for an hour, or until the dough doubles in bulk a second time. Butter two 9- or 10-inch round cake pans and set aside. After the second rising, punch down the dough and cut in half with a knife. Roll each half into a ball. On a floured board, roll out each ball into an 8-inch circle about 1 inch thick. Place in the prepared pans, brush the tops-with melted butter, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Let rise another 30 to 40 minutes, or until doubled in bulk. Place in a preheated 375Â°F oven and bake about 40 to 45 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. Cool on a wire rack before serving.
