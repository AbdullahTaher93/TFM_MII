In a large heatproof bowl, beat the egg yolks. Using the back of a knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add the seeds and bean pod to the eggs. Add the milk and butter and stir. Set the bowl over a large pot of simmering water (or use a double boiler); the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. Whisk constantly, frequently checking the temperature of the mixture with an instant-read thermometer, until it registers 140 degrees. Remove from the heat. Discard the vanilla bean. Add the coconut and stir until incorporated. (The mixture will look like the filling of a Mounds candy bar.) To shape the kisses, use about 1 tablespoon per morselâ€”I like to form them into little pyramids, but you may prefer little spheres. Set them on a platter and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Spread the almonds on a plate. Put the chocolate into another large heatproof bowl and melt it over simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Pour a little of the melted chocolate into a shallow cup. With a fork (a cocktail or fondue fork works great), gently skewer each kiss and dip it into the chocolate, then quickly roll it in the chopped almonds and place on a platter. Continue this process, adding more chocolate to the cup as necessary, until all are dipped and rolled. Let the chocolate set in a cool place before serving. (Stored in an airtight container at room temperature, these will keep for up to a week.)
