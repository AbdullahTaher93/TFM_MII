Whisk together the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Cover and let the mixture come to room temperature. (You can also heat it gently in the microwave for about 40 seconds.) Set aside. Quarter or mince the Brussels sprouts, unless they are very small, in which case leave them whole. Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add the Brussels sprouts and sprinkle lightly with salt. Stir, cover, and cook over medium heat until quite tender (8 to 10 minutes). When they are done to your liking, transfer them to a serving bowl or small platter, and pour the sauce over the top. Serve right away.
