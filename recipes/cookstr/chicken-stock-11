Put the chicken parts in an 8-quart stockpot, and add cold water to cover, leaving 2 inches of space at the top of the pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; then reduce the heat so that the liquid simmers steadily. Using a large spoon or soup skimmer, skim off the brown foam that rises to the top. After 5 minutes or so, the foam will become white, and no more skimming will be necessary. Add all the remaining ingredients. Partially cover the pot and adjust the heat so that the stock barely simmers. Cook the stock for at least 2 but preferably 4 hours, adding water, if necessary, to keep the bones covered.
