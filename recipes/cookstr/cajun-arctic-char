Combine the paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, thyme, basil, onion powder, oregano, and cayenne. Brush the fish with butter, season with salt, and coat well with the mixed spices. Heat a large skillet over high heat 3 minutes. Add the oil and swirl the pan to coat. Add the fish fillets, skin side up. Sear until dark brown; the pan should smoke as the fish cooks. Turn once. The fish should be medium rare. Serve with lemon wedges. Quick Fish Salad: Toss 1 pound skinless, boneless cooked fish (such as Arctic char), with 6 tablespoons mayonnaise and 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard. Season with 1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning, a squeeze of lemon, and cayenne to taste. Quick Fish Cakes: Add 1 egg per pound of boneless, skinless cooked fish fillet (such as Arctic char) and enough cracker crumbs to make the mixture easy to shape (usually about ½ cup, depending on the moisture content of the fish). Season with ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, ½ cup sautéed chopped onion, 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, and 1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning. Form into 6 cakes, roll in additional cracker crumbs, and fry in butter or olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges.
