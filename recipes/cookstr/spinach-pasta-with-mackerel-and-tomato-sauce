In the center of each mackerel filet you will see a dark line with small bones protruding from it. Remove this and cut remaining fish into 2-inch chunks. Set aside. To cook pasta, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil, with 1 tablespoon salt, in a large 6-quart pot. As the water is coming to a boil, proceed with the sauce. Heat serving plates. Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet. When hot, add garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds. Add anchovies, olives and capers and sauté for 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce and red pepper and stir until the sauce is bubbling. Add the fish chunks and stir over low heat for about 10 minutes, or until the fish looks flaky. Taste and season (you probably will no: need any salt because of the anchovies and capers). When the pasta water comes to a boil, add the fettucine and cook until cooked through but still al dente. Drain and refresh under hot water, not cold, so that you do not cool off the pasta. To serve, place a portion of pasta in each heated plate, ladle some fish sauce over that and sprinkle on the Parmesan.
