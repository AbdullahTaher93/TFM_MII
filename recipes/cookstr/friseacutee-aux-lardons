PREP Prepare the bacon by placing the cubes in the saucepan, covering them with water, and bringing to a quick boil. When the water boils, drain the bacon, discarding the water. Toast the baguette slices in the oven with a drizzle of olive oil. Make sure you have your vinaigrette ready to go. COOK Place the sauté pan on high heat for 2 minutes, or until sizzling hot. Add the bacon and cook until crispy and brown. Place the cooked bacon in the salad bowl and discard all but 2 tablespoons (28 ml) of the bacon fat. Over medium-high heat, add the chicken liver vinaigrette to the now empty but still hot pan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat. SERVE Place the frisée in the salad bowl with the bacon and add the shallot. Toss the salad with the vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper. Spread some Roquefort on each of the slices of toasted baguette. Divide the salad among six serving bowls, top each with two cheese-smeared toasts, and serve.
