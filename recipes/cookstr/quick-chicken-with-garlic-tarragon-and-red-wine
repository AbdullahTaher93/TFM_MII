Heat the oil in the pressure cooker over high heat until beginning to smoke. Add the thighs, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and turn to coat. Add the garlic, tarragon, and red wine. Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 2 minutes to finish cooking. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure. Transfer the thighs to a serving platter and set aside in a warm place. Reduce the juices left in the pot over high heat for 2 minutes. Swirl in the butter and pour over the thighs. Garnish with extra tarragon and serve.
