Peel and coarsely grate or shred the potato. Combine with all the remaining ingredients except the peanut oil. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet or on a griddle over medium-high heat. Add 1 heaping tablespoon potato mixture to the skillet or griddle. Flatten slightly and fry 1Â½ to 3 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned. As you fry the cakes, add additional oil as necessary. Place on paper towels to absorb the oil before serving. Serve immediately.
