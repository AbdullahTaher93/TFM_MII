Combine the dill, shallots, garlic, scallion, pepper, oil, maple syrup, and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Use your hands to mix it thoroughly. Generously spread this mixture over the flesh side of each fillet. Let the fillets sit at room temperature until your grill is ready. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes. Take the cedar planks from the water and season them with salt. Place them on the grill, close the lid, and let them heat until they start to smoke and crackle, usually about 5 minutes. Keep a close eye on the cedar planks while they are heating. Sometimes they tend to catch on fire, and you might want to have a spray bottle filled with water handy to control this. Turn the heat down to medium and place the salmon on the planks, skin side down. Close the lid and cook without turning the fillets for about 12 minutes. This will give you a medium doneness; the fish will still yield to the touch. When the salmon is done, remove the planks from the grill and transfer the salmon to a platter. Serve immediately with the lemon wedges.
