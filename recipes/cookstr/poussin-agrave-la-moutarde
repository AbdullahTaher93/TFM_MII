Preheat the oven 425°F. Truss the chicken and cover it all over with a thick layer of mustard. Bake in a small gratin dish until the mustard turns golden brown, about 40 minutes. Heat the crème fraîche in a small pan. Take the chicken out of the oven and remove any surplus mustard; pour on the créme fraîche. Bake for 10 minutes more. To serve, place the chicken on a hot dish. Whisk the sauce, taste it for seasoning, and whisk in the butter just before serving.
