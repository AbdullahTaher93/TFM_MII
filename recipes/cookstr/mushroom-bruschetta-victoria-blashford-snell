Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Brush the bread slices with the oil. Place on baking sheets and bake for 10 minutes, turning once, until crisp. Melt the butter in a pan. Cook the mushrooms, stirring often, around 5 minutes, until wilted. Add the shallots and garlic and cook about 3 minutes more. Add the Marsala, and boil about 5 minutes until the wine is reduced to a glaze. Add the cream, and boil for 3 minutes, until reduced. Season with salt and pepper and add the Parmesan and parsley. Spoon the mixture over the toasts to serve.
