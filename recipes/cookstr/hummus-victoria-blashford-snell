Drain the chickpeas, reserving about 5 tbsp of the canning liquid in a small bowl. Carefully rinse the chickpeas under cold running water. Drain well and transfer to a food processor or a blender along with half of the reserved canning liquid. Add the lemon juice, tahini, and garlic and blend until smooth and creamy, adding a little more of the canning liquid as needed. Season to taste with salt. Transfer the hummus to a small serving bowl, sprinkle with paprika, and serve at room temperature. Variation: Red Pepper Hummus: Position a broiler rack about 6in (15cm) from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Cut in half lengthwise and seed a small red pepper. Grill, skin side up, until lightly charred. Cool, peel, and roughly chop the pepper. Add to the blender along with the chickpeas. If the pepper is juicy, add less canning liquid. Add 1 tsp ground cumin for a spicier flavor.
