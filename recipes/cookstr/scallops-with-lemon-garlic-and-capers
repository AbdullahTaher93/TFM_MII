Season the scallops with salt and pepper. Set aside. Heat a nonstick skillet big enough to hold all the scallops in a single layer over high heat until hot. Add butter. Place scallops in skillet, 1 at a time, on one of their flat sides. Let brown, then add the garlic. Let garlic begin to caramelize, then add the oil and capers. Turn each scallop over, browned side up. Add the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the parsley. Cook, covered, until scallops turn opaque, about 5 minutes more. Spoon lemon-garlic mixture over scallops. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley.
