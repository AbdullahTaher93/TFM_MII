Place the lentils, scallions, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper, and oil in a large bowl and toss to mix. Cover the bottom of a serving platter with the lettuce leaves. Spoon the lentils on top of the lettuce and sprinkle the cheese over the lentils. Drizzle a little extra walnut oil over all and serve.
