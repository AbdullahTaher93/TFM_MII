Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Season the crown roast with the thyme and with generous amounts of salt and pepper, pressing the seasonings into the meat. Cover the tips of the bones with aluminum foil to prevent burning, and place the roast in a shallow roasting pan. Roast for 30 minutes for perfectly cooked medium-rare meat. If you like your lamb cooked to medium, add another 5 minutes of cooking time. Place the roast on a decorative round serving platter, and let it rest for 10 minutes. Then fill the center with the tabouleh, and garnish the tabouleh with a full, leafy mint sprig. Arrange the watercress and the remaining mint sprigs around the roast. To serve, spoon the tabouleh from the center of the roast onto plates; then carve the roast between the bones into chops.
