In a small skillet over medium heat, toast the coriander, mustard, cumin, and peppercorns, stirring constantly, until the spices become fragrant. Grind them fine in a blender or spice mill. Add the flaked coconut to the spices, and grind again. Set the mixture aside. In a stockpot or large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the ginger and jalapeño, and cook for 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, rice, water, and salt. Over high heat, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Then cover the pan, and turn the heat to low. When the stew has simmered for 10 minutes, add the carrots. Cover the pan again, and cook for 8 minutes, stirring once or twice to keep the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Stir in the spice-coconut mixture. If the carrots and rice are not yet tender, cook the stew a few more minutes. When they are tender, stir in the spinach (you may need to do this in two batches, waiting a minute or so for the first batch to wilt). Let the stew cook, covered, for another minute, then stir it, season it to taste with salt and pepper, and serve it in large bowls with crusty bread on the side. Variation: For a more protein-rich meal, tofu works very well in this dish. Use half of a 16-ounce package of firm tofu, and cut it into ½-inch cubes. Add the tofu to the stew along with the spices. A bit of extra salt will be needed, too.
