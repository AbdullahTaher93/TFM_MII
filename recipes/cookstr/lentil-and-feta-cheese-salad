Rinse the lentils and check them for small stones. Combine in a saucepan with 3 cups water and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer gently until done but still firm, about 30 minutes. Check frequently toward the end of cooking time to make sure the lentils donâ€™t become over-cooked. Drain any excess water from the lentils, and rinse until cooled. Combine the lentils with the remaining ingredients in a serving bowl and toss together. Serve at once or cover and refrigerate until needed.
