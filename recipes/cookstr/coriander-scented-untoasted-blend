Place all the ingredients in a spice grinder or coffee grinder, and grind until the texture resembles that of finely ground black pepper. Store the mixture in a tightly sealed container, away from excess light, heat, and humidity, for up to 2 months. (In my opinion, refrigerating the blend adversely affects its flavors.)
