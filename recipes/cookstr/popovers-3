Beat the eggs lightly and beat in the flour and salt. Stir in the milk. Blend to make a fairly smooth batter. Add the melted butter. Pour into 10 to 12 buttered muffin tins or custard cups, filling about two-thirds full, place in a cold oven set for 425 degrees and bake 30 to 35 minutes. Reduce the temperature if the popovers seem to brown too much. When they are baked, pierce each one with a skewer or knife to dry them out, if you like.
