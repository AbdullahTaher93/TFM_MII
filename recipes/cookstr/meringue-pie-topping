Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Beat the egg whites with the salt until light and frothy. Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat until the whites are stiff enough to hold in peaks. Add the vanilla extract and beat in the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until meringue is stiff and glossy. No grains of sugar should be felt when a small amount of the mixture is rubbed between the fingers. Pile the meringue lightly on cooled pie filling, spreading the meringue until it touches the edges of the pastry to prevent the meringue from shrinking. Bake for 5 to 6 minutes, until the top is brown.
