Preheat the broiler. Remove and discard as many of the parsley stems as possible. Wipe each mushroom cap with a damp towel. Remove the stems and reserve them for some other use. In a blender or food processor, combine 4 tablespoons of the butter with the parsley, pine nuts, garlic, lemon juice, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Process until finely pureed. Stuff some of this mixture into each mushroom cap and place the caps on a baking sheet. Halve each slice of bread, so that you have 6 triangles. Sauté the bread triangles in the remaining butter until they are golden-brown on both sides. Salt them lightly and set aside. Just before serving, broil the mushrooms about 2 inches away from the heat, for about 5 minutes, or until they begin to soften and the butter is almost completely melted. Serve the mushrooms on the toast.
