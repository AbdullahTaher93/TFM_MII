Grease and flour an 8-inch fluted Bundt pan. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a bowl, beat the eggs with an electric mixer until thickened and light colored. Gradually beat in the granulated sugar, then—in order—the orange juice, orange zest, and oil. Beat in the flour and, finally, the baking powder. Pour the batter into the pan and bake for about 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean and the cake springs back to the touch. Cool slightly, then turn out onto a serving dish. Dust with confectioners’ sugar, or finish in any of the ways described in the headnote.
