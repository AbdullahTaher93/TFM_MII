Preheat oven to 425°F (200°C). Mash potatoes in a medium bowl with a fork to make about 4 cups. Mix in flour, butter, salt, and pepper. On an ungreased cookie sheet, shape potato mixture into a 9-inch (22.5-cm) circle, ½ inch (1.2 cm) thick. Brush egg yolk on top (the egg makes a brown glaze), using a brush or your fingertips. Bake 35-40 minutes or until golden brown and firm to touch. Transfer to a serving plate and cut into wedges at the table.
