Soak the dried shrimp in boiling water for 1 hour, then drain. Soak the noodles in hot water for 6–7 minutes, then drain. Heat a wok over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil, and heat until very hot. Pour in the egg and swirl to coat the wok, then cook for 1–2 minutes, or until set. Remove from the wok and cut into small pieces. Preheat the wok over high heat, add the remaining oil, and heat until very hot.
