1 Sprinkle the steaks with salt and press about a teaspoon of pepper into each side of the steaks. Put the butter and oil in a 10- or 12-inch skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. When the butter melts, turn the heat to high and add the steaks. Cook until almost done, 3 to 4 minutes per side for rare. Turn off the heat and transfer the steaks to a warm platter in a low oven. 2 Add the Cognac to the pan, turn the heat to low, and stir, then add the mustard and cream. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. 3 Add the steaks and any accumulated juices to the sauce, turn once or twice, and serve.
