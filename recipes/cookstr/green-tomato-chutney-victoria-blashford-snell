Mix the tomatoes, onions and apples together in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the brown sugar, vinegar, ginger, and peppercorns, and mix again. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring almost constantly to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to low and simmer about 1Â¾ hours, stirring often to discourage scorching, until the chutney is thick and pulpy. Have ready 6 hot, sterilized 1quart (1 liter) glass canning jars. Screw the lids on the hot jars. Let stand until cooled. Wipe the jars clean and label. Store in a cool dark place. Once opened, store in the refrigerator and eat within a week. Variation: Banana and Green Tomato Chutney: Substitute peeled, thickly sliced bananas for the apples and 1 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp ground allspice, and 1 tsp ground ginger for the ginger and peppercorns. Replace the apples with bananas and the spices with 1 tbsp mild curry powder, 1 heaped tsp allspice and 1 tsp ground ginger.
