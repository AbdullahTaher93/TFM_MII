Place the haddock in a single layer in a large, deep frying pan. Add enough water to cover and heat over medium heat until just simmering. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a plate and cool. Meanwhile, bring the rice, 2 cups water, saffron, and Â½ tsp salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer about 15 minutes, until the rice is tender. Remove from heat and stir in the butter. Remove the yolks from the hard-boiled eggs; chop finely, and set aside. Chop the egg whites and stir into the rice with the flaked fish and 2 tbsp chopped parsley. Spoon onto heated plates, sprinkled with the chopped egg yolk and parsley, and serve with the lemon wedges.
