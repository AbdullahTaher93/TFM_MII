Place the vegetables on a large chopping board. Roughly chop the vegetables. Sprinkle with 2Â½ tablespoons of the vinegar and lightly season to taste with salt and pepper. Continue chopping until the vegetables take on a consistency of a relish, add the remaining vinegar and seasonings. Spoon the chowchow into a bowl, cover, and chill for 1 hour.
