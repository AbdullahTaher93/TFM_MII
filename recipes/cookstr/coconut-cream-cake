Combine the butter, shortening, and buttermilk together and blend with the mixer. Add the baking soda to the buttermilk to dissolve. Add the buttermilk mixture, flour and extracts to the egg yolk mixture and mix with the electric mixer until smooth. Gently fold the egg whites and coconut into the smooth mixture. Divide the batter evenly into the three prepared pans. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
