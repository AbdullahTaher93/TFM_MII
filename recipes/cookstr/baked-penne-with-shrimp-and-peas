In a covered pasta pot over high heat, bring water to a rapid boil. In a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and tomatoes and cook, stirring, until onion is soft and tender, about 3 minutes. Add peas and basil and cook, stirring, until vegetables are soft and tender, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add shrimp and wine, stir and cook until shrimp are half-cooked (barely opaque). Remove from heat and set aside. Add salt and penne to the boiling water and cook, uncovered, over high heat until pasta is almost al dente. Scoop out about 1 cup (250 mL) of the pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain pasta. Return sauté pan to low heat. Add 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the reserved pasta water and penne and, using a wooden spoon, toss to coat evenly, adding more pasta water if necessary. Sprinkle prepared dish with half of the breadcrumbs. Add penne mixture and sprinkle with remaining breadcrumbs. Bake in preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Serve immediately.
