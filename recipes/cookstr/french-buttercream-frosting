In a saucepan, cook sugar and water over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil gently, without stirring, until temperature reaches 242°F (117°C) on a thermometer. Check to make sure sugar granules are not clinging to sides or pan. If there are, gently brush off with a wet pastry brush. Meanwhile, in a mixer bowl fitted with whip attachment, beat eggs on high speed just until foamy. Remove sugar syrup from heat, reduce mixer speed to low and gradually pour in syrup in a steady stream. Try not to pour syrup onto the whip as this will spray sugar onto sides of bowl and it will harden. AFter all sugar mixture has been added, increase speed to high and whip until mixture cooks to room temperature, about 20 minutes. You can test this by touching the bottom half of bowl. With mixer running, add butter, a couple of pieces at a time, whipping until butter is incorporated and buttercream is fluffy and creamy, about 4 minutes.
