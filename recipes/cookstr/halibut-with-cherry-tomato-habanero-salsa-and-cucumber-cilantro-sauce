Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, chiles, and mint. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt. Toss gently to combine. Lightly season the fillets on both sides with salt. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Place the halibut fillets in the hot pan. Brown for about 2 minutes on each side, then transfer to the oven and bake until opaque throughout, 8 to 10 minutes. Put the halibut fillets on plates and top with a scoop of the tomato salsa. Spoon some of the cucumber-cilantro sauce around the fish. Serve the remaining sauce on the side. Puree the cilantro, cucumber, lemon juice, olive oil and salt in a food processor or blender until almost smooth with just a bit of texture. Cover and refrigerate until serving or for up to 2 days.
