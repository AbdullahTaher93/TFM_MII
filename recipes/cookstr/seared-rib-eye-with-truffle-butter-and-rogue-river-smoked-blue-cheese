To prepare the truffle butter, combine the shallots, butter, truffle salt, and parsley in a small bowl. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Heat a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil. Season both sides of the steaks with salt and pepper. Cook the steaks for 3 minutes on each side, then transfer to the oven and bake for 5 minutes to finish cooking. Remove from the pan, let the steaks rest for 5 minutes, spread with truffle butter, and cut into ¾-inch-thick slices. Sprinkle the crumbled blue cheese over the sliced steak. Serve with Butter-Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes. To make the mashed potatoes, in a large pot, cover the potatoes with cold salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes. Warm a 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Put the potatoes in the skillet and partially mash with a potato masher. Add the butter, sour cream, salt, and pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the butter is melted and the potatoes are creamy and still slightly chunky. Serve hot.
