Prepare the crêpes. To make the almond praline: In a small, heavy skillet over medium heat, heat the sugar until it melts. Add the nuts, shake to coat, and cook until the syrup turns a light amber color. Immediately pour onto a sheet of buttered aluminum foil; let cool. Chop finely or pulverize in a blender or food processor. In a small, deep bowl, cream the cheese until fluffy. Beat in the sugar and amaretto, brandy, or almond extract. Pour in the cream and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold in two-thirds of the peaches. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the praline and fold in the remainder. Spoon one-eighth of the peaches and cream on each crêpe and roll up. Spoon some of the remaining peaches alongside, and sprinkle with the reserved praline.
