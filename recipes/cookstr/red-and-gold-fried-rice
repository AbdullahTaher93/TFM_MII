In a small bowl, soak the mushrooms to warm water to cover until softened, about 20 minutes; drain. Discard the stems and chop the caps. Place a wok or stir-fry pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the oil, swirling to coat the sides. Add the onion and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the beef and mushrooms and stir-fry until the meat is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Add the rice, separating the grains with the back of a spoon, and cook until the rice is heated through. Add the tomatoes, green onions, ketchup, broth, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and salt and stir to combine. Make a well in the center of the rice, add the eggs, and gently stir the eggs until they form soft curds, about 1 minute. Stir to mix the eggs into the rice. Transfer to a serving plate and serve.
