Preheat a waffle iron. In a bowl, whisk together the flours, pecans, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft, glossy peaks form. In another bowl, beat or whisk together the egg yolks, milk, buttermilk, butter, and maple extract. Add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Fold in the egg whites. Spoon or pour about 1 cup batter onto the hot iron. Close the lid, Bake until the waffle is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove with a fork to a warm plate. Serve at once or keep warm on a baking sheet in a 200Â°F oven. Repeat with the remaining batter. Top with Homemade Maple Syrup, Caramel Sauce, Butterscotch Sauce, or diced fresh pineapple and coffee or vanilla ice cream.
