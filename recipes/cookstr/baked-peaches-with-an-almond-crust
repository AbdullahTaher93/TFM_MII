Preheat oven to 350° F (180° C) In a small bowl, combine ground almonds, sugar and 1 tbsp (15 mL) butter, mixing with a spoon to form a paste. Cut a ring around the peaches and neatly separate them in halves. Remove pits. Lightly rub 1 tsp (5 mL) butter all over the peaches to grease the surfaces. Put peach halves in baking dish, skin-side down. Heap a quarter of the almond paste into the pit cavity of each half. Bake the peaches for 20 minutes. Serve (half a peach per portion) immediately, garnished with a dollop of ice cream and/or a smear of raspberry coulis.
