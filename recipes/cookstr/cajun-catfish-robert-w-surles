Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. In a bowl combine the buttermilk and hot pepper sauce. Place the fillets in the buttermilk mixture. In a shallow dish combine the bread crumbs, thyme, mustard, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and pepper. Stir in the oil. Remove fish fillets from buttermilk mixture, letting the excess drip off. Dip the fish in the bread crumb mixture, pressing firmly onto fish. Arrange fish on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until firm, opaque, and coating begins to tum golden brown, about 10 minutes.
