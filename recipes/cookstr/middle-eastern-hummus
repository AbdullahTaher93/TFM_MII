In the container of a food processor or blender, combine the chickpeas, tahini, oil, Â¼ cup water, the lemon juice, garlic, cumin, cayenne, and salt and pepper to taste. Blend until smooth. The texture should be thick but creamy. Add more water if needed; season to taste with the cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Place the hummus in a low, wide serving bowl. Surround the hummus with a thin circle of the chopped spiced nuts. Sprinkle a very light dusting of cayenne in the center.
