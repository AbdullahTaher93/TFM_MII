Prepare the crust: Place the flour, cornmeal, salt, butter, and cream cheese in a food processor and process just until the mixture begins to gather into a ball. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Prepare the filling: Place the turnips in a small saucepan, cover with water, and boil until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain, peel, and cut into 3/8-inch dice. Set aside. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the leeks and carrots; sauté 5 minutes. Stir in the tarragon and 1 cup of the wine. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan, and cook 10 minutes. Uncover, increase the heat, and cook until almost all the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and set aside. Place the clam juice, remaining 1 cup of wine, and the heavy cream in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium. Cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture coats a spoon heavily, about 20 minutes. Blend the flour into the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Whisk this mixture into the sauce and cook until smooth and quite thick. Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Combine the sauce with the diced turnips, sautéed leeks and carrots, and the raw shrimp, scallops, and cod. Preheat the oven to 400° F. Butter a round, 2-quart baking dish. Transfer the filling to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the Swiss cheese over the top. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out about ¼ inch thick and in a circle about 1 inch larger than the top of the baking dish. Place the dough over the top of the dish and crimp the edges. Mix the egg and water and brush over the top of the dough, then slash several steam vents in the top. Bake until the crust is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Let sit 5 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve.
