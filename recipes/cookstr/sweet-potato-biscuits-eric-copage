In a medium saucepan, cook the whole sweet potato in boiling (unsalted) water until tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, about 20 minutes. Let the sweet potato cool, then pare it and mash until smooth. You should have about 1 cup mashed sweet potato. Let the cooking water cool to warm (105° or less). Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 425°. In a medium saucepan, stir the mashed sweet potato with the melted butter until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Stir in the milk, sugar, and egg. Sift the cake and all-purpose flours, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl, and then stir into the liquids to combine. Knead briefly in the bowl to form a soft dough. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough to ¼-inch thickness. Using a 2½-inch round cookie cutter, cut out biscuits. Gather up the scraps, reroll, and repeat the procedure until 12 biscuits are cut out. Transfer the biscuits to an ungreased baking sheet. Bake the biscuits until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
