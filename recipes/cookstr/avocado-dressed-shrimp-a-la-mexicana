In a medium bowl, combine the shrimp, onion and tomato. Measure the lime juice into a food processor or blender. Cover and turn on. Drop in the chile(s) and, when finely chopped, turn off and scoop in the avocado and cilantro. Process until smooth. Thin to a “creamy dressing” consistency with water, usually 2 to 3 tablespoons. Taste and season with salt. Usually about 1 teaspoon. (You will have about 1½ cups.) Mix the dressing into the shrimp mixture. Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the shrimp a la mexicana and refrigerate. When you’re ready to serve, scoop into a serving bowl. Decorate with cilantro sprigs and it’s ready.
