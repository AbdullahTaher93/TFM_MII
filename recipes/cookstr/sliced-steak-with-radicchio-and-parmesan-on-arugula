Season both sides of the steaks with salt and pepper. Light a charcoal fire or preheat your gas grill on high. Oil the grillâ€™s cooking surface. Place the steaks on the grill and cook 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare or to your desired degree of doneness. Remove from the grill and let stand as long as 30 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, whisk the oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste together in a large bowl. Add the arugula and toss until well coated. Place on a platter, arrange the sliced steak on top, then top with the radicchio and Parmesan. Serve immediately.
