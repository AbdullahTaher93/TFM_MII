Combine all of the ingredients except the chia seeds (and melon) in a blender. Blend the mixture on the high setting until smooth. Taste and adjust lemon or sweetener to your liking. Whisk the chia seeds into the mixture (make sure they don't clump up). Pour the mixture into a glass jar. Cover with a lid and refrigerate overnight, or at least 2 to 10 hours to allow the chia to form the pudding.
