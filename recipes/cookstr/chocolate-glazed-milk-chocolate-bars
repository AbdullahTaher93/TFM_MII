Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. TO MAKE THE BATTER: In a heavy saucepan over low heat, cook the butter, milk chocolate, and semisweet chocolate chips until melted, stirring. Allow to cool. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the sugar, vanilla, salt, and eggs. Add the flour and stir well. Add the cooled chocolate mixture to the flour mixture and stir to combine. Scrape and spoon the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the pan comes out clean. Cool the cookies in the pan. TO MAKE THE GLAZE: In a small saucepan over low heat, cook the chocolate chips, corn syrup, and butter until well blended and melted. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and cool for 5 minutes. Spread the glaze evenly over the top of the pan and cut into 24 cookies. Store in an airtight container, between layers of waxed paper, for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 1 month.
