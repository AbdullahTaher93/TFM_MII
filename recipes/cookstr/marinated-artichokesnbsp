In a large saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, bay leaf, and garlic. Bring the liquid to a simmer. Add the artichokes, crushed red pepper, and salt to taste. Cook until tender when pierced with a knife, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Pour the contents of the pan through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Reserve the liquid. Pack the artichokes into sterilized glass jars. Pour in the cooking liquid to cover. Let cool completely. Cover and refrigerate at least 24 hours or up to 2 weeks. To serve, drain the artichokes and toss them with oil.
