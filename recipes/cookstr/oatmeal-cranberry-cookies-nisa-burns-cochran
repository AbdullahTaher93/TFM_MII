Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Use butter or cooking oil spray to grease a cookie sheet, or use parchment paper to cover the cookie sheet instead. In a sauce pot, combine the water and cranberries. Cook over medium to high heat until the water begins to boil. Turn off the heat and allow the cranberries to cool. Stir the vanilla extract into the cranberry mixture. In a large bowl, mix the oil, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and eggs. Beat well with an electric mixer or whisk. Add the cranberry mixture to the sugar mixture. In another large bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and oats. Add the dry ingredients into the cranberry-and-sugar mixture and stir slowly. Keep mixing until all ingredients are fully combined and the dough becomes soft and sticky. . Use a spoon to form dough balls about the size of a Ping-Pong ball. . Drop each dough ball onto the cookie sheet so all the balls are evenly spread out. . Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the cookies are golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes before serving.
