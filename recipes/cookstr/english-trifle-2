To Make the Pastry Cream: Place sugar, cornstarch, and salt in heavy saucepan. Slowly stir in milk, stirring until cornstarch dissolved. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sauce comes to a boil. Reduce heat to low and boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove pan from heat. Beat eggs in separate bowl. Slowly pour about 1 cup (236 mL) hot pudding into eggs, while beating constantly, until completely mixed. Gradually pour the warmed eggs back into the hot pudding while whisking or stirring rapidly. Return pan to heat and cook on low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute or until mixture thickens. Do not let pudding boil or eggs will curdle. (I use an instant-read thermometer and cook to 160°F [71°C]). Stir in butter and vanilla. Remove from heat and press a piece of plastic wrap on surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Cool and store in the refrigerator. To Assemble the Trifle: Spread jam on each slice of pound cake and place in trifle bowl or in 2-quart (1.9 L) casserole. Drizzle with sherry. Spoon Pastry Cream over pound cake. Add strawberries if desired. Beat whipping cream in bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whisk until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until thickened, scraping down sides of bowl a few times. Spread over the custard and top with whole strawberries. Refrigerate until serving.
