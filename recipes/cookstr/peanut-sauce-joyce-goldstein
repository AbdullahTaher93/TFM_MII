In a small saucepan, combine all of the ingredients and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes to combine well. To serve, reheat gently, whisking in a bit of water as needed for a spoonable consistency. Store in a jar in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to 4 months.
