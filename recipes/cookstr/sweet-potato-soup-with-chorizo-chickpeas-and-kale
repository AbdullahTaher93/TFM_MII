Pour the soup base into a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in ½ cup of the water and cook until the soup is bubbling hot, 3 to 4 minutes. Add more water if you want the soup thinner. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and keep it hot. Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Slice through the chorizo casing and squeeze the sausage into the skillet. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until the chorizo’s fat starts to melt, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chickpeas and cook until the chorizo and chickpeas brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the kale and stir-fry until the kale wilts slightly and brightens in color, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the soup base into a soup bowl, top with the chorizo mixture, and eat.
