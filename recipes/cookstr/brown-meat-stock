Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Combine the beef bones, onions, and carrots in a roasting pan. Roast, turning the ingredients occasionally, about 40 minutes, until well browned. Transfer the bones, onions, and carrots into a large saucepan, adding any vegetable trimmings, the bouquet garni, and the peppercorns. Pour in enough cold water to cover by 1in (2.5cm). Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to low and simmer 3-4 hours, until well flavored. Strain the stock into a large bowl. Let stand 10 minutes, then skim the fat from the surface. Use immediately, or cool completely and refrigerate or freeze.
