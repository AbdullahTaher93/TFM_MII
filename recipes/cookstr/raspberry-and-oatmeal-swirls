Put the frozen raspberries into a blender with the sugar, and purée until they make a vibrant super-pink sauce. You may have to be patient as they will be difficult to blitz at first since they are extremely hard when frozen. Gather together six glasses of about ¾ cup capacity, and spoon 1–2 teaspoons of the raspberry purée into each one. (I wouldn’t dream of sieving.) Then dollop in each glass about a couple of tablespoons of the yogurt, and then sprinkle a layer of cookie crumbs on top of that. To get the cookie crumbs, just put a few cookies in a bag and bash with a rolling pin, but if you wanted you could use a processor, though it scarcely seems worth the effort. Why give yourself another whole batch of stuff to wash up? Cover the crumbs with one more layer of yogurt, then raspberry and finally cookie crumbs again. Strange though it sounds, you can make these the night before, in which case don’t sprinkle on the final layer of crumbs until you are ready to eat the swirls but leave the glasses, yogurt on top, covered with plastic wrap. I prefer them made – and you can see that it’s hardly heavy labor – à la minute, but I have many takers for the thickened, mellowed, fridge-softened version. These things, as with food generally, are a matter of taste, which of course is how it should be.
