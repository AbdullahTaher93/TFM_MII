Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Toss the olive oil, lemon juice and zest, almonds, garlic, and parsley together in a mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place the pieces of tilapia on a large baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Season lightly with salt and pepper and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Divide the almond and herb mixture among the four pieces of fish and smooth the mixture over each piece to create an even coating. Bake until the almond mixture has browned slightly and the fish is cooked through and flakes easily, about 15 minutes.
