Place the egg yolks, Dijon mustard, and vinegar in a food processor. Blend on medium speed for 1–2 minutes. Slowly drizzle oils into the mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time. If the marinade becomes too thick, add 1–2 tablespoons of warm water. Once all of the oil has been incorporated, add seasoned salt, pepper, lemon pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder until incorporated. Store covered in the refrigerator until needed.
