Line a baking sheet that will fit in your freezer with parchment or wax paper. Place the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe container and microwave on medium for 20 seconds. Stir and return to microwave for another 10 seconds. Chocolate burns easily, so check and stir every 10 seconds until fully melted. Pour the melted chocolate into a squeeze bottle. Squeeze the chocolate over the parchment paper, making abstract shapes. Leave a bit of space between each shape, for easy removal. Place the tray in the freezer tor about 2 hours. Once the chocolate is set, use a spatula to remove it from the parchment. When you are ready to serve dessert, scoop the ice crean into a bowl. Top with one of the chocolate decorations. Serve immediately, splashing amaretto over the ice cream at the table.
