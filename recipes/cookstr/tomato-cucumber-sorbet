METHOD Combine the tomatoes, cucumbers, and cilantro in the bowl of a food processor or bar blender and process until smooth, adding cold water slowly, as needed, to facilitate the blending. Add the lime zest and juice, sugar, and salt, then adjust the seasoning as necessary. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a shallow freezable container. Cover loosely with plastic or waxed paper and place in the freezer. Stir every 30 minutes until it starts to hold its shape. In about 4 hours it will have attained a scoopable consistency. Scoop into chilled glasses or bowls. As a palate cleanser, serve with a sprig of cilantro. As an appetizer, use it to top a fresh cucumber, radish, and onion salad.
