Combine the chicken, eggplant, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, canola oil, brown sugar, vinegar, allspice, ginger, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl or resealable plastic bag. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Bring to room temperature before cooking. In a steamer basket or makeshift steamer, steam the broccoli, bell pepper, onion, and carrot until al dente. Heat a dry cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet or wok over high heat for about 4 minutes. Saute the marinated ingredients until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Toss in the steamed veggies and water chestnuts and cook for a couple minutes longer to heat through. Serve over the cooked quinoa.
