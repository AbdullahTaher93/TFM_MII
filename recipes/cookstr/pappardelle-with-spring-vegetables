In a covered pasta pot over high heat, bring water to a rapid boil. Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic, asparagus, peas, fava beans and carrots and sauté, stirring, until vegetables are tender but not browned, about 7 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes to meld flavors. Add wine and cook until reduced by half. Remove from heat and set aside. Add salt and pappardelle to the boiling water and cook until pasta is almost al dente. Scoop out about 1 cup (250 mL) of the pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta. Return sauté pan to medium heat. Add 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the reserved pasta water and heat through. Add butter and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add pappardelle and, using a wooden spoon, toss to coat evenly, adding more pasta water if necessary. Add half of the Parmigiano- Reggiano and toss well. Transfer to a large serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
