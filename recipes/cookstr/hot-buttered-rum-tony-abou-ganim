In a mixing bowl, beat together softened butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and spices until well combined. Refrigerate in an airtight reusable containerâ€”it is best to make the batter at least 48 hours in advance of using, so the spices have an opportunity to mingle (it will store for up to a month). Be sure to remove the batter from the refrigerator at least 6 hours prior to serving, to allow it to soften. In a preheated coffee mug, combine 2 heaping tablespoons of batter with the rum. Top with 6 oz (180 ml) of boiling water and stir well to mix. Serve with a spoon.
