Heat the oven to 500Â°F with a rack in the center. Place the fennel slices in a 14-x-12-x-2-inch roasting pan. Drizzle the oil over the slices and turn until coated evenly. Arrange the slices in a single layer. Sprinkle with the salt. Roast for 10 minutes. Rub the spice mixture over both sides of each quail. Set aside. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and carefully turn the fennel with a spatula, pushing the pieces to the sides of the pan. Place the quails breast side up in the center aisle of the pan and roast for 5 minutes. Turn them over and roast for another 5 minutes.
