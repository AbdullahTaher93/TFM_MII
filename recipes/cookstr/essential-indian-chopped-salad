Place the cucumber, tomatoes, and onion in a large bowl. Add the minced green Serrano chilies, ginger, and cilantro and toss. Cut the lime in half and squeeze the lime juice over the tomato mixture. Mix in the sugar, black salt, black pepper, cumin, and crushed peanuts (if using). Chill for at least 20 minutes prior to serving to let the flavors settle.
