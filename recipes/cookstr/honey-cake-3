Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans with the margarine and dust with flour. Invert the pans and tap to shake off excess flour. Sift the flour, baking powder, and baking soda into a measuring cup. Beat the eggs in the bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed, and gradually add the sugar until pale and ribbons start to form, about 10 minutes. Lower the speed and add the tea, oil, honey, banana, orange rind, cinnamon, and cloves. Combine thoroughly. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the flour mixture a little at a time, combining well after each addition; there should be no traces of flour visible. Divide the batter evenly between the 2 loaf pans. Place side by side (without touching) in the center of the oven, and bake for 15 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for another 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out dry. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack, then loosen the sides of the cake with a knife and unmold. If you’d like to freeze the cakes, wrap each first in wax paper, then foil, and place in a freezer bag.
