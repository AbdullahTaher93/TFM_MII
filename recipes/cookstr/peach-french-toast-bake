Coat a 9 × 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Cut the baguette into ½-inch-thick slices and arrange them in a single layer in the pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg whites, milk, and vanilla. Pour the egg mixture over the bread in the pan. Scatter the peach slices evenly over the bread. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Uncover and bake until it is slightly puffed and the bread is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Top with yogurt and drizzle with maple syrup, if desired.
