Heat the olive oil in a large non-reactive pot over moderate heat. Add the onion and saut√© until translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the parsley and garlic and cook briefly to release their fragrance. Add the tomato puree, basil, and salt. Simmer briskly until reduced to a saucelike consistency, stirring occasionally so nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. The timing will depend on the ripeness and meatiness of your tomatoes and the size of your pot. If the sauce thickens too much before the flavors have developed, add a little water and continue cooking. Taste and adjust the seasoning. If the sauce tastes too acidic, add a pinch of baking soda and cook for 5 minutes more. If it needs a touch of sweetness, add the sugar and cook for 5 minutes more. Remove the basil stem before serving.
