Cook the black and red currants and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until the fruit gives off its juices. Stir in the strawberries and blueberries and cook just until they begin to soften. Cover the bottom of the bowl with a round of bread trimmed to fit. Line the sides of the bowl with bread slices as needed, trimmed and overlapping to fit. Spoon some of the fruit juices over the bread. Fill the bowl with the fruit, packing it well. Cover with the remaining bread, trimmed to fit. Place the bowl on a plate. Cover with plastic wrap. Place a small plate inside the bowl and weigh with a heavy can of food. Refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Uncover the bowl and turn the pudding out onto a serving platter. Serve chilled. Good with ice cream or whipped cream.
