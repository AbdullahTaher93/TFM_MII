The Process If you have a rice cooker, place all ingredients in except edamame. If not, bring water, rice and ginger to a boil. Turn down to low, cover with a tight lid, and cook 25 minutes for sushi rice or 35 minutes for brown rice. Toss edamame in when rice is almost cooked. Cover and let stand. Serve with cilantro and tamari.
