Do ahead: Burgers and chipotle sour cream can be made one day ahead. Reheat burgers and a 325Â° oven or serve at room temperature. In a medium bowl, combine garlic, cilantro, turkey, cumin, chili powder and salt. Mix thoroughly. Form turkey mixture into eight patties. Lightly brush burgers with oil. Heat grill and cook burgers on the middle of the grill, cover down, for 4-6 minutes. Turn and continue cooking for another 4-6 minutes. In a small bowl, add chipotle peppers to sour cream in increments, stirring and tasting, to desired heat. Stir in salt and combine thoroughly. Slather burgers with sour cream and serve.
