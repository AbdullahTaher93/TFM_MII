Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), combine all of the ingredients except the almonds or confectioners’ sugar, if using, and mix on low speed until blended. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 2 minutes to make a sticky dough. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls. Press them into the sliced almonds or roll in confectioners’ sugar, if using. Place the cookies on a lined baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart. Using your fingers, slightly flatten the tops of the cookies. Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Let the cookies cool on the parchment paper for easiest removal. When the cookies are cool, use a metal spatula to loosen them from the parchment paper. Store in an airtight container.
