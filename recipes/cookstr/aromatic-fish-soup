In a large saucepan over high heat, combine olive oil, salt and pepper. Add onions, celery and fennel seeds. Saut√©, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until beginning to brown. Immediately add tomatoes, garlic, bay leaves, oregano and basil; cook, stirring, for 5 to 6 minutes or until sauce-like. Stir in water; bring to boil. Add parsley and fish heads. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 35 to 40 minutes on a steady bubbling (but not rolling) boil, stirring infrequently. Take off heat. Cover and let cool 1 to 2 hours to develop flavors. Strain, pushing down on ingredients and mashed down pulp to extract all the broth. Discard leftovers from strainer. (Recipe can be prepared to this point up to 2 days in advance; cover and refrigerate broth.) Bring the strained broth to a boil. Add potatoes, reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 10 to 15 minutes or until soft and pierceable. Add fish and shrimp (if using); reduce heat to medium and cook 3 to 4 minutes or until the fish is tender but not overcooked. Stir in lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place a toasted slice of bread into each of 4 bowls. Top each with one-quarter of the soup, making sure that potatoes and fish are distributed evenly. Garnish generously with chopped chervil and serve immediately.
