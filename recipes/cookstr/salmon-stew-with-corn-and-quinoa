In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add pancetta and cook, stirring, until it begins to brown, about 3 minutes. (If youâ€™re using bacon, cook until crisp and drain off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan before proceeding with recipe.) Reduce heat to medium. Add leeks and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add thyme, cayenne, bay leaf and salt and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add wine, bring to boil and boil until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add stock and corn and return to a boil. Stir in quinoa. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until quinoa is almost tender, about 15 minutes. Add salmon and simmer until opaque and flakes easily with a fork, about 6 minutes. Stir in whipping cream and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in Pernod, if using. Garnish with chives.
