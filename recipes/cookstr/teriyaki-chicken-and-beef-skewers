Place the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, oil, mirin, if using, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a small bowl or in a small container with a lid and stir well or shake to combine. Pour the teriyaki marinade into a 1-quart heavy-duty zipper-top plastic bag or a larger plastic container with a lid. Add the chicken or steak and mix to coat well. Seal the bag or container and let the chicken or steak marinate in the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours (the longer it marinates, the more pronounced the teriyaki flavor will be). Youâ€™ll want to flip the baggie or toss the meat in the container a couple of times during the marinating process so that it marinates evenly. If you are using wooden skewers, at least 30 minutes before cooking soak them in water to cover in order to prevent them from burning. Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet or spray it with nonstick cooking spray. Preheat the broiler (see Notes). Remove the chicken or steak from the marinade, setting aside the marinade. Skewer 1 or 2 pieces of chicken or steak on each skewer lengthwise, threading them so they are on securely. Place the skewers on the prepared baking sheet and broil until the teriyaki sauce turns a nice burnished color and the chicken is cooked through or the meat is cooked to your liking, 2 to 4 minutes on each side for chicken, another minute or 2 for medium steak. Pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and let the marinade simmer until it becomes slightly reduced and glazelike, about 4 minutes. Serve the skewers on a platter sprinkled with the sesame seeds, if desired. Pass around the boiled marinade in a small pitcher or bowl for drizzling over the meat or whatever starch or veggies you are serving alongside.
