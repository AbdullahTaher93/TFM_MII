Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. In a 9-x-13-inch roasting pan, combine the potatoes, kale, bell pepper, pumpkin seeds, light olive oil, and salt. Stir well. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender and golden brown. Let cool. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl. Add the celery, raisins, and scallions to the cooked vegetables and toss well to mix. In a small bowl, whisk together the extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, and rice syrup until emulsified. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
