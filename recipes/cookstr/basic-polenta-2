Pour 2Â½ quarts cold water into a saucepan. Turn the heat to medium and stir in the cornmeal, salt, and olive oil. When the polenta starts to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring constantly, for 40 to 45 minutes. If lumps form, use a whisk to get them out. The polenta is ready when it has the consistency of cream of wheat. If it is too stiff, stir in a little hot water.
