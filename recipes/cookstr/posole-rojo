Put the pork in a 4-quart slow cooker and add 6 cloves of the garlic, the epazote (if using), and oregano. Pour in the stock and cook on the low setting, covered, for 6 hours, or until the meat is falling off the bones. Meanwhile, pour 3 cups boiling water over the chiles and let them soak for 30 minutes. Place the chiles and soaking liquid in a blender, along with the remaining 2 cloves garlic and the onion, and puree. Set aside. Using tongs, remove and discard the bones and fat from the pork ribs. Pour the chile puree into the cooker, stir in the hominy, and continue to cook, covered, for 30 minutes longer, until heated through. Season generously with salt to taste and stir in the lime juice. Ladle the posole into wide, shallow soup plates and serve with the toppings in separate small bowls alongside.
