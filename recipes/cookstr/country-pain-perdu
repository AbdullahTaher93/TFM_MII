In a small bowl, combine the egg yolks, milk, salt, and pepper. In separate bowl, combine the cornmeal and oregano. Slice the tomatoes and place them on paper towels. Place the bread flat in a casserole dish. Pour the egg custard mixture over it and let it sit while you heat a sauté pan over medium-high. Add 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of oil--just enough to coat the pan--and then 1 tablespoon butter. When the oil and butter are hot carefully move the bread with a spatula from the casserole pan to the sauté pan. Fry the bread for about 2 minutes on each side until it is golden and browning and crispy in places. Set the bread aside. Remove the pan from the heat and add the bacon. Fry until they reach the desired crispness. Meanwhile, dredge the tomatoes in the cornmeal mixture. When the bacon is done, remove it from the pan and pour it off a bit of the grease, leaving just about 1 tablespoon, and then fry the tomatoes for about 2 minutes each side until the cornmeal mixture is lightly browned. Top the bread and the tomatoes and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Drape bacon across the tomatoes and serve.
