Preheat oven to 375°F. Rub yams or sweet potatoes with oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Wrap each separately in aluminum foil and roast in oven for 1½ hours. Transfer to a plate and let rest just until cool enough to handle. Peel skin off yams and place yams in a bowl. Add honey and butter and mash with a fork; butter should melt completely. Yams can be reheated in an oven or microwave if necessary. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
