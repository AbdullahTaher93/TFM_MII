Place the celery, bell pepper, onion, and water or broth in a 1-quart pot. Cover and cook over medium heat for several minutes, or until the vegetables are soft, adding more water if needed to prevent scorching. Remove the pot from the heat and drain off any excess liquid. Add the salmon, mayonnaise, seasoning, and 2 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs to the vegetables, and mix well. Stir in the egg white. Divide the salmon mixture into 8 portions and shape each portion into a ball. Place the remaining breadcrumbs in a shallow dish, and roll each ball in the crumbs to coat all sides. Pour the oil in a large skillet and preheat over medium heat. Add the salmon balls and flatten each one with a spatula to create a burger shape. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the underside is lightly browned. Turn the cakes over and cook until the second side is lightly browned. Serve hot with fresh lemon wedges, Easy Hollandaise Sauce (see Notes), or additional mayonnaise mixed with a little seasoning, if desired.
