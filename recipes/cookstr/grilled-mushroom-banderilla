Clean the mushrooms with a towel and trim the dry, dirty stems. Avoid washing them if possible, because they absorb too much water. In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, cook 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the onion, celery, garlic, and saffron. Cook until the onions soften, 5 to 6 minutes. Do not brown the onions. Stir in the tomato paste, wine, mushrooms, and thyme and simmer on low heat for about 15 minutes, until the wine and liquid that the mushrooms release while cooking has reduced and glazed the mushrooms. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the lemon juice. Season well with salt and pepper. Cool and set aside. Prepare a charcoal grill (see Notes). While your grill is heating, divide the mushrooms evenly among the skewers: about 6 chanterelles or hen of the woods mushrooms, or 3 oyster mushrooms to a skewer. Youâ€™ll know that the grill is hot enough to use when the charcoal has turned from red and black to gray. Place the skewers on the edges of the grill, not directly over the fire, and sear the mushrooms for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. The mushrooms should be golden and crispy and smoky in flavor. Serve the mushrooms warm.
