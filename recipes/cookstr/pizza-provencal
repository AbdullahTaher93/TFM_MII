Combine the water, yeast, and sugar, if desired, in a small bowl. Let stand 10 minutes to proof the yeast. By hand: Combine the flour, basil, and salt in a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture and the oil, stirring until a soft smooth dough forms. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade: Combine the flour, basil, and salt by pulsing twice. Blend in half the yeast mixture with a few quick pulses. Add the rest of the yeast and the oil through the feed tube while the machine is on and operate until the mixture forms a ball of dough, about 30 to 45 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead 5 minutes, adding a bit more flour as necessary to make the dough manageable. Shape the dough into a ball and place the dough in an oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough’s surface. Let rise until double in bulk, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, mash with a fork, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Heat the oven to 450 F. Lightly oil a 12-inch round pan, then dust with cornmeal. Punch the dough down, remove from the bowl, and knead for 1 minute. Stretch or roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Spread the beans over the dough, then top with the tomato slices and the pesto. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake until the crust is browned, about 20 to 25 minutes. Variation: Use a prebaked pizza crust. Sprinkle the basil over the fresh tomato slices and bake until pesto is bubbly and cheese melts, about 10 minutes.
