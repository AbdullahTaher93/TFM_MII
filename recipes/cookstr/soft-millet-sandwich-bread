Soak the chia seeds in the Â½ cup water for at least 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease an 8-by-4-by-4-inch loaf pan and dust with brown rice flour. In a large mixing bowl, combine the arrowroot, millet flour, quinoa flour, brown rice flour, tapioca flour, flax meal, salt, and xanthan gum. In a separate large mixing bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), dissolve the yeast in the room temperature water. Add the olive oil and maple syrup. Just as the yeast begins to foam and feed on the maple syrup, about 3 minutes, add the combined dry ingredients and the chia seeds with their soaking liquid. Mix until you have achieved a soft dough. This will not take long. A stand mixer with a paddle attachment works well, but so will an old-fashioned wooden spoon and a tireless arm. Once your dough is formed, use a spatula (0 guide and pour the batter-like dough into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the surface so that it is even and attractive. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and score with one line that runs the length of the dough, just off center. Place in the hot oven. Once the oven door is closed, decrease the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Decrease the temperature to 300 degrees F and bake for an additional 25 minutes, until golden brown and crusty.
