Preheat oven to 170 degrees. When tenderloin is untrimmed, this piece of meat is covered by a thick skin, especially at the tail, where there is a big lump of fat. Clean away the excess skin and fat, pulling it from the meat. Rub the steak with the oil, then sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Place the steak on the rack of the hot grill so it is 2 to 3 inches from the hot ashes. Cook for about 4 minutes on each side, to mark it well and brown the exterior. Remove to a tray, and place, uncovered, in the 170-degree oven to continue cooking in its own juices and relax, so it is pink throughout. Leave the meat in the oven for at least 15 minutes, but it can stay as long as an hour. Meanwhile, prepare the shallot garnish. For the shallot garnish: Melt the butter in a skillet. Stir in the shallots, salt, and pepper, and saut√© for about 2 minutes over medium heat, until the shallots soften. Mix the chopped parsley and wine into the shallots. To serve: Pour the shallot garnish over the hanging tenderloin, cut the meat into thin slices, and serve with some of the garnish.
