Pre-heat the oven to 350Â°. Butter and flour a 10-inch cake pan. Line with parchment. Melt the chocolate with the liqueur or brandy and coffee. Transfer to a medium/large bowl and set aside to cool until lukewarm. In a stand mixer bowl over boiling water, whisk the eggs and sugar together until they are just warm. Then beat in the mixer until very pale and tripled in volume. Add a fourth of the egg mixture to the chocolate, then mix all the chocolate back into the egg. Fold in the flour, then fold in the stiffly beaten whipped cream. Pour into the prepared cake pan. Place the cake pan in a larger pan. Pour water into the larger pan until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Bake 40 to 50 minutes until puffed and firm, but still moist. Remove the pan from the water bath and cool on a rack. Unmold to a plate or cardboard cake form and peel off the parchment paper. Then turn top side up. Before serving, slice into 12 pieces, but keep together. Reheat just before serving for 5 to 6 minutes to warm. Serve on a drizzle of caramel or raspberry or vanilla cream. A bit of whipped cream and some chocolate shavings are a nice finish.
