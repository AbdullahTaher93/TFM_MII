Place the vinegar, egg, egg yolks, and mustard in a food processor. Blend until combined. With the motor running, pour in the oil in a steady stream. When the sauce is thick and creamy, add the crushed garlic and lemon juice, and process until well combined and smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Variation: Classic Aioli: To make this sauce by the traditional method, place the vinegar, egg, egg yolks (all at room temperature), and mustard in a bowl set on a folded kitchen towel. Using a balloon whisk, beat until thick. Add the oil, drop by drop, whisking constantly. Whisk in the remaining oil, 1 tbsp at a time. Whisk in the garlic and lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper.
