Rinse the eggs with warm water and place them in a saucepan. Cover with warm salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 13 minutes. Drain the eggs and run them under cold water until they are cool. When the eggs are cool, peel them and then halve them lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the yolks and place them in a bowl. Set the whites aside. Lightly mash the yolks with a fork. Add the smoked salmon, capers, 2 teaspoons of the chives, the lemon zest, and salt and pepper, and stir with a fork. Still using the fork, carefully stir in the caviar. Mix the crème fraîche and mayonnaise together in a small bowl, and add this to the yolk mixture to bind it. Fill the egg whites with the salmon mixture, mounding it attractively. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon snipped chives over the eggs, arrange them in a spoke fashion on a small decorative plate, and watch them disappear.
