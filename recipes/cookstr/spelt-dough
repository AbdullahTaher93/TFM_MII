Pour the water into a large bowl, then add the honey and yeast. In a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt. When the yeast begins to foam, mix in 1 cup of the flour. Add the oil and mix until completely incorporated. Add the remaining flour Â¼ cup at a time, mixing well with your hands or a fork. Sprinkle a little flour out on your work surface, turn out the dough, and knead until it feels smooth. The dough should be soft and slightly sticky. (If it is very sticky, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix until smooth. If it is too stiff, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix until smooth.) Form the dough into a ball and place in an oiled clean bowl. Drizzle a little oil over the top and make sure it is evenly coated with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and a clean dish towel and set aside in a warm spot. Let rise till it has doubled in size, about 1 hour. When you are ready to make your pizza, divide the dough in two on a lightly floured board and proceed with your pizza making. (The dough can be frozen for up to a month; thaw at room temperature before using.)
