Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) Divide pastry dough into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other. On a lightly floured surface, roll out larger piece of dough into a circle large enough to fit pie plate, dusting work surface and dough as necessary to keep the dough from sticking (or roll between 2 pieces of waxed or parchment paper). Press dough into prepared pie plate. Place pie plate in freezer or refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes to chill while you prepare the filling. Roll out remaining dough for top crust and set aside at room temperature on sheet of parchment paper. Filling: In a large bowl, gently combine peaches, raspberries, sugar and cornstarch, making sure that cornstarch is not lumpy. Transfer filling to prepared bottom crust. Lightly brush edge of pastry with a little water. Place top crust over fruit, trimming and fluting edge. Cut steam vents in top of pie. Brush top with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Place pie plate on baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350°F (180°C) and continue baking for 40 minutes more or until nicely browned and juices are bubbling and thickened. If pie starts to get too brown before it’s finished baking, cover loosely with a piece of tented foil. Let cool on a wire rack for 2 hours before serving. Variation: This pie would also work well with a lattice top.
