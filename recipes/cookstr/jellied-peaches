Pour boiling water over the peaches and let them stand a few minutes to loosen the skins. Peel carefully and arrange in a serving dish. Melt the currant jelly and spoon over the peaches very carefully so that each peach receives a full coating. Chill, and serve with sour cream or whipped cream and a few chopped pistachio nuts for a garnish.
