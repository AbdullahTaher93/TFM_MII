Heat the olive oil in a soup pot, add the garlic, and sauté over very low heat for several minutes. Add the carrots, leeks, fennel, and celery and sauté briefly. Add the tomatoes, parsley, basil, bay leaves, and peppercorns and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add 7 cups water and the Parmesan rind. Cover and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, partly covered, for about 1 hour, adding salt to taste toward the end of the cooking time. Strain. Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 days.
