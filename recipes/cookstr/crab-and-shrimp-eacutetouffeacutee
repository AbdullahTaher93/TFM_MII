In a large, heavy pot, over medium-low heat, melt the butter, then add the flour. Stirring often, cook until the foam subsides and the mixture turns a golden color, like sandpaper, 10 to 12 minutes (see Eula Mae’s advice on making a roux). Add the yellow onions, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until soft and golden, about 15 minutes. Add the bell peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the water and stir to blend until the mixture thickens. Add the shrimp and stir to mix. Cook, stirring occasionally until the shrimp turn pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the salt, Tabasco, and black pepper and continue to cook for 5 to 7 minutes longer. Add the green onions, parsley, and crabmeat. Don’t stir or you’ll break up the crabmeat. Gently shake the pot, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it rest (with the lid on the pot) for about 5 minutes. Serve over the rice in soup or gumbo bowls.
