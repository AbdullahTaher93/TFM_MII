In a small saucepan, combine the cream, butter, and corn syrup. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat and add the chocolate all at once. Shake the pan to make sure all the chocolate is submerged; let the chocolate melt for about 2 or 3 minutes. Whisk smooth, then scrape into a bowl and cool to room temperature, when the ganache will set and thicken. Use the cooled ganache immediately to sandwich any rolled or drop cookies.
