Line a 9 × 5in (23 × 13cm) loaf pan with plastic wrap. Melt the chocolate, sugar, butter, and cocoa in a medium saucepan over very low heat, stirring often. Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl. Whisk in the chocolate mixture. Let cool. Beat the cream in a chilled bowl until soft peaks form. Fold into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the loaf pan and smooth the top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours, until chilled and set. Invert onto a serving platter and remove the plastic wrap. Using a knife dipped into hot water, cut into slices. Serve, with the raspberries. Variation: Individual Chocolate Marquises You can make pretty individual desserts by spooning the mixture into individual ramekins, and chilling to set. Then pipe whipped cream on top, decorate with a few raspberries, dust with cocoa powder, and serve.
