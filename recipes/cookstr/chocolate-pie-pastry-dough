In a large bowl, using a blending fork, blend together flour, cocoa, sugar and salt. Add shortening and blend until dough resembles coarse crumbs. Add ice water, by spoonfuls, while tossing mixture with fork. Add only enough water to make dough stick together. Press dough into a ball. Flatten into a disk and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm enough to roll out for your pie, about 20 minutes. Fill and bake according to recipe directions.
