Heat the oil in a wok or heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them crackle and get aromatic, about 20 seconds (or just 5 seconds for ground cumin), then add the onion and chile. Stir briefly, then add ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stir for a minute or so, until they start giving off their liquid. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the tomatoes are soft, about 10 minutes. Remove the cover, lower the heat, and simmer a little longer, to reduce the liquid slightly. Taste for salt and adjust if you wish. (We like this slightly salty, especially if we’re serving it with grilled or roast meat, so we usually add at least another ½ teaspoon.) Just before serving, stir in the herbs, if using. TIBETAN GINGER-TOMATO CHUTNEY: I encountered another version of this salsa-like condiment in Lhasa. There the touch of heat came from ginger rather than from dried red chile. Substitute 1 tablespoon minced ginger for the dried chile. This chutney pairs especially well with beef dishes.
