Slice the pears, dropping each slice immediately into a nonreactive bowl filled with the lemon juice to avoid discoloration. In a heavy nonreactive soup pot, combine the pears with the remaining ingredients and 1 cup of cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the pears for 45 minutes until almost tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pear wedges to sterilized jars. Divide the spices equally among the jars. Add enough of the syrup to reach Â½ inch from the jar rims. Wipe the rims and seal with the lids. Cool to room temperature. Store the pickled pears in the refrigerator. (Keeps 3 to 4 weeks.)
