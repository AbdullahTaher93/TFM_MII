In a double boiler, combine the buttermilk and garlic. Cook over simmering water, without stirring, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the milk solids curdle in the center of the pan and leave a ring of watery liquid around the rim. Strain and discard the watery liquid. Transfer the curdled milk to a blender or food processor. Puree until, smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Use now, or cover and refrigerate for up to 4 days. Use as you would sour cream. If necessary for a recipe, reheat gently without boiling.
