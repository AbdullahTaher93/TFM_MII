Chop off the fronds where they meet the body of one fennel bulb. Halve the fennel, then thinly slice it, using a mandoline or a very sharp, thin-bladed chef's knife. Repeat with the other bulb. You should have 2 cups of slices. Set them aside. Chop 1 tablespoon of the fronds and set it aside separately. Discard the remaining fronds. Put the fennel and apple slices in a bowl. Add the pecorino Romano, lemon zest, Â¼ cup olive oil, and parsley. Toss gently. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the salad on a large, chilled serving plate. Drizzle more olive oil generously over the top, and scatter with the chopped fennel fronds just before serving. VARIATIONS If you can't find pecorino Romano cheese, or simply prefer Parmigiano-Reggiano, by all means substitute it. Crisp, sweet pears, such as Bosc, are a good autumnal replacement for the apples.
