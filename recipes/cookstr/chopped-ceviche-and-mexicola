Put the chopped fish in a wide shallow dish and sprinkle over the lime juice, salt, and oregano. Leave this for 8 minutes. Drain the fish; it will have made a milky liquid. Add the scallions, cilantro, and chile, and stir gently together. You can either put teaspoonfuls onto little toasts and sprinkle over some more cilantro, or put the ceviche into a bowl for everyone to dip tortilla chips into.
