In a mixing glass, add spiced rum, orange curaçao and fresh lemon sour; shake with ice until well blended. Strain into a chilled cinnamon-sugar rimmed cocktail glass (see Notes) and garnish with an orange spiral. To sugar-cinnamon rim a cocktail glass, first chill the glass, then rub the rim’s circumference with a lemon wedge. Dip the rim into a bowl with a mixture containing 1 teaspoon (5 ml) ground cinnamon and ½ cup (120 mi) superfine sugar (regular granulated sugar does not adhere as well).
