Place the sour cream, cheese, garlic, vinegar, and mustard with 3 tbsp of water in a food processor, and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, and stir in the chives. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into a serving bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve. Variation: Cheese Dressing: If you prefer, use another blue cheese, such as Danish blue or Gorgonzola or the same quantity of crumbled Cheddar cheese will make an equally creamy dressing.
