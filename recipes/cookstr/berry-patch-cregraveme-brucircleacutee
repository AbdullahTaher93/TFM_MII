Preheat the oven to 275°F. Reserve ½ cup of the berries for garnish. Place six standard-size flan dishes in a baking pan. Divide the remaining berries among the dishes. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until pale in color. Whisk in the 1/3 cup sugar until dissolved. Whisk in the mas carp one or sour cream, then gradually whisk in the heavy cream. Stir in the framboise. Divide the custard mixture among the dishes. Pour warm water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the center of each custard still jiggles slightly. Remove from the oven and lift the dishes from the hot water. Let cool briefly, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 1 day. When ready to serve, place the dishes on a baking sheet and evenly sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar over each custard. Using a hand-held blowtorch, caramelize the sugar (see Notes). Garnish the top of each dish with the reserved berries.
