Fill a pot for the pasta with about 6 quarts of water, place over high heat, and bring to a boil. Peel and devein the shrimp. Cut one-third of the shrimp into ½-inch pieces and leave the rest whole. Peel and lightly crush the garlic cloves. Put the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet, add the garlic, and place over medium-high heat. Sauté until the garlic cloves are lightly browned on all sides, then remove them and discard. While the garlic is sautéing, dissolve the tomato paste in the white wine. After removing the garlic cloves, add the wine with dissolved tomato paste to the pan and cook until the liquid has reduced by about half. Add the whole shrimp and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the shrimp have turned pink, 2 to 3 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat. When the water for the pasta is boiling, add about 2 tablespoons salt, add the linguine, and stir until all the strands are submerged. Cook until al dente. Finely chop enough parsley to measure 2 tablespoons. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked shrimp to a food processor. Pulse until the shrimp are chopped to a medium-fine consistency, then return them to the pan. Place the pan back over medium-high heat and add the cream. Cook until the cream has reduced by about half, then add the raw shrimp and the parsley. Season lightly with salt and cook until the shrimp pieces turn pink, 1 to 2 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat. When the pasta is done, drain well, toss with the sauce, and serve at once.
