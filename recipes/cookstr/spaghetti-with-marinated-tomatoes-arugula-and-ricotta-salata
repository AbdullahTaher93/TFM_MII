In a large serving bowl, combine the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, chiles, and salt to taste. You can do this step a couple of hours ahead; keep at room temperature. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Just before the pasta is done, put the arugula in the serving bowl. Drain the pasta and add it to the bowl along with the cheese. Toss until the arugula wilts slightly, then serve immediately.
