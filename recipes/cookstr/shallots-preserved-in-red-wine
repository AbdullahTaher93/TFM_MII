Combine the shallots, wine, and vinegar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil, uncovered, until all the liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Watch carefully toward the end of the boiling time to be sure the shallots donâ€™t burn. Stir in the olive oil and season with plenty of freshly ground pepper. The shallots will keep, covered, for 4 weeks in the refrigerator.
