In work bowl fitted with metal blade, process sun-dried tomatoes and basil until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring milk and butter to a simmer until an instant-read thermometer registers approximately 120° to 130°F (50° to 55°C), about 3 minutes. Do not let boil. Meanwhile, in clean work bowl fitted with metal dough blade, add 2 cups (500 mL) of the flour, yeast, sugar and salt and process until well combined, about 15 seconds. With the motor running, slowly pour hot milk mixture through the feed tube into the work bowl. Add egg and process until incorporated, about 20 seconds. With the motor continuing to run, add sun-dried tomato mixture until incorporated. With the motor running, spoon additional flour through the feed tube, ¼ cup (50 mL) at a time, until dough pulls away from sides and begins to gather and a soft, not sticky, dough forms, about 90 seconds. Remove dough from work bowl and place on a floured surface. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 3 to 5 minutes. Shape into a ball. Transfer to a large oiled bowl and turn to coat all over. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doublein volume, about 45 to 90 minutes, depending on humidity and heat factors. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Punch down dough and form into two round loaves. Place on prepared baking sheet, at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Cover with a towel and let rest in a warm, draft-free place until they rise slightly, 20 to 30 minutes. Bake in preheated ovenuntil light brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool on wire rack. Variation: If fresh basil is unavailable or too expensive, use Italian parsley instead.
