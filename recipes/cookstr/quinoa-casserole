Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Rinse the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear. Dump the quinoa into the crock. Add the olive oil and mix around. Pour in the chicken broth, and add the salt and cinnamon. Stir in the almonds and cranberries. Cover and cook on low for 4 to 6 hours, or on high for 2 to 4 hours. The quinoa is done when you can fluff it with a fork and it is tender. The liquid should be pretty well absorbed, similar to when rice is done. Fluff the quinoa with a fork, and add the tomatoes and feta cheese. Stir gingerly to mix. Add a large handful of baby spinach to the top of the crock, and close lid. Cook on high for about 20 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted. Stir again to distribute the spinach. The tomatoes, spinach, and feta provided a great “fresh” aspect not usually present in casseroles.
