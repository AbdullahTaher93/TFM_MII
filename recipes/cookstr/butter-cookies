Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sift together the flours and set aside. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and mix with the paddle attachment until well incorporated but not whipped—two minutes on medium-low. Switch to low speed and slowly add the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Mix just long enough for the dough to come together. Roll out the dough on a lightly dusted wooden counter until one-quarter inch thick. Cut with a cookie cutter into small rounds and gently move to cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake until the edges are just brown—twenty-two to twenty-eight minutes.
