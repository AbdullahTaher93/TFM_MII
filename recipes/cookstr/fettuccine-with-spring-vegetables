In a skillet large enough to hold the fettuccine, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, five minutes or until softened. Bring at least 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt to taste. Add the broccoli and asparagus and cook for 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, scoop out the vegetables and drain them well, leaving the water boiling in the pot. Put the broccoli and asparagus in the skillet along with the peas and cream. Bring to a simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Put the fettuccine into the boiling water and cook, stirring frequently, until the pasta is al dente, tender yet still firm to the bite. Drain the fettuccine and add it to the skillet. Add the cheese and toss well. Sprinkle with basil and serve immediately.
