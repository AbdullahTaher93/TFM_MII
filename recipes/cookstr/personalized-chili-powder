Preheat the oven to 300°F. Break the stems from all the chiles and remove the seeds. Transfer the chiles to a baking sheet and arrange them in a single layer. Place the pan in the oven. The chile de árbol or cayenne pods will be toasted first so remove them after 4 or 5 minutes. Bake the larger pods an additional 4 or 5 minutes until they are well dried. When the chiles are cool enough to handle break them into two or three pieces each and transfer them to a blender. Pulverize the pods briefly until you have powder. Add the remaining ingredients and blend just until they are combined. Store the chili powder in a jar or other covered container for up to 3 months.
