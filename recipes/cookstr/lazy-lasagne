Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente (tender but firm to the bite). Drain. Prepare the Béchamel Sauce: In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Gradually stir in flour and cook until flour pulls away from the side of the pan. Gradually whisk in hot milk and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened. Add bay leaf, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cook, whisking, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until bubbly. Remove from heat. Spread about 1 cup (250 mL) of the tomato sauce in bottom of prepared pan. Layer half of the pasta on top and spread with half of the remaining tomato sauce. Top with the remaining pasta, then the remaining tomato sauce. Spread béchamel sauce evenly over top layer and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese (if using). Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until bubbly and browned on top. Let cool for about 10 minutes before cutting into 6 squares. Variations: To boost calcium, add 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 mL) blanched chopped calcium greens, such as kale or broccoli, to the lasagna, layering them between the pasta and the sauce. To increase the protein and calcium content, add 1 cup (250 mL) chopped tofu or soybeans to the tomato sauce.
