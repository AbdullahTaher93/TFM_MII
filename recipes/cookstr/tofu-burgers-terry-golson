1) Preheat the oven to 450°F. Coat a baking sheet with a nonstick spray or line with parchment paper. 2) Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel. Squeeze out all the excess moisture. Twist the towel hard around the tofu because the less water, the better the texture of the burgers. 3) All the ingredients can easily be mixed in a food processor using the steel blade. Mince the garlic first, then pulse in the rest of the ingredients. If you’re mixing the ingredients by hand, make sure the garlic is finely minced and the egg is lightly beaten before putting it all together. Handle it as you would meatloaf, kneading it with your hands. 4) Using your hands, form the mixture into 4 patties. Place them on the baking sheet. 5) Bake for 10 minutes, turn over, and bake for 5 minutes more.
