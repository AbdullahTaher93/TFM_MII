Heat the oil and butter in a large soup pot with lid over low heat. Add the shallots, celery, garlic, and chile and cook until the shallots have softened. Stir in the paprika. Add the mussels, tomatoes, and wine and stir well. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Cover and cook, shaking the pan often, for about 6 minutes, or until the mussels have opened. Transfer the mussels to deep serving bowls and sprinkle with parsley. Serve hot.
