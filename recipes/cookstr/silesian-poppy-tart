Sift the flour and baking powder together into a bowl. Add 2/3 cup of the sugar, 9 tbsp of the butter, 1 beaten egg, ½ tsp of the vanilla, the salt, and 4 tsp water. Work with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together. Bring the milk and remaining 1 tbsp butter to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the semolina and poppy seeds. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes, until the mixture is thick. Let cool for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly butter an 11in (28cm) springform pan. Roll out half of the dough into an 11in (28cm) round and fit into the bottom of the pan. Roll out the remaining dough into a long strip about 1¼ in (3cm) wide and line the sides of the pan. Stir 2/3 cup plus 2 tbsp sugar, 2 eggs, and ½ tsp vanilla with the farmer's cheese, pear, almond flour, and raisins into the cooled poppy seed mixture. Spread evenly in the pan. Bake for about 1 hour, until the pastry edge is golden brown and the filling looks set. Let cool for 30 minutes on a wire cake rack. Loosen the tart from the sides of the pan with a knife, then remove the sides. Sift confectioner's sugar over the tart and serve warm or cool completely.
