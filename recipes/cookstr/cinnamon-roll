In a jumbo mug, combine the water, yeast, brown sugar, and raisins. Mix together well, then set aside to proof for 15 minutes. When the yeast is bubbly, stir in the flour, salt, and ½ teaspoon of the cinnamon. Mix vigorously with a fork to create an elastic dough. Cover the mug with a damp paper towel and set aside to rise for 30 to 60 minutes. Microwave the dough for 1½ to 2½ minutes until risen and firm, but not dry. In a separate mug, mix the remaining ½ teaspoon cinnamon with the confectioners sugar and the milk until well combined. Drizzle over the finished cinnamon roll, and sprinkle with the pecan pieces. Serve immediately.
