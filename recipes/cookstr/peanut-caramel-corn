EQUIPMENT: 2 rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment paper and lightly coated with nonstick spray; a candy thermometer Place the popcorn in a large bowl and toss with the peanuts. Set aside. Stir the brown sugar, granulated sugar, honey, and butter together in a small saucepan. Cover the pan and bring to a boil over medium heat. The steam generated by covering the pan will wash down any sugar crystals that form on the sides, enabling the creation of a smooth caramel. Carefully remove the lid and insert a candy thermometer into the syrup. Boil until the temperature reads 260°F, 15 to 20 minutes. Keep an eye on the syrup to make sure it doesn’t scorch or boil up too high. Remove the pan from the heat, stand back, and stir in the vanilla and baking soda (the syrup will foam up when you add these ingredients). Immediately pour the hot caramel syrup over the popcorn and peanuts. Stir quickly but gently with a lightly greased spatula until the popcorn and nuts are coated evenly. Spread on the prepared pans and use a fork to separate the popcorn as much as possible while it is still warm. Set aside to cool. The popcorn softens as it absorbs the caramel and needs to dry thoroughly to recrisp. Use immediately; storage will cause the caramel to become tacky.
