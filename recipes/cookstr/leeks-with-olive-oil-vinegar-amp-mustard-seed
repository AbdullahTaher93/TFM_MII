Trim leeks and rinse under running water. In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Cook leeks until very soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and place in a serving dish. Using a mortar and pestle or electric spice grinder, finely grind mustard seeds. In a small bowl, blend vinegar and mustard seeds. Slowly whisk in olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon dressing over leeks and garnish with dill.
