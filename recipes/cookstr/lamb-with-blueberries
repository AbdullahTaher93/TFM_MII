Season the lamb with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large, heavy-bottomed frying pan over high heat. Cook the lamb in batches for 3â€“4 minutes on each side, until browned and medium-rare. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Add 1 tbsp of the oil to the pan. Add the scallions and cook for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the stock and jelly and cook until the jelly is dissolved and the liquid boils. Add the blueberries and simmer, uncovered, for 2 minutes, then add the mint. Transfer the lamb to dinner plates and spoon the sauce on top. Serve immediately.
