Heat the oil in a 9-inch saucepan over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the onion and cook for a minute, or until translucent. Add the millet and 1¾ cups of the chicken stock. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes. Add the zucchini, garlic, and ½ cup of the remaining stock. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Cooking can be stopped at this point. To complete and serve, add the basil, salt and pepper to taste, and the remaining stock. Bring back to a boil and cook until the stock is absorbed.
