Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) Topping: Sprinkle 1 tsp (5 mL) brown sugar into each prepared muffin cup. Stack pineapple slices and cut into 3 wedges. Place 2 wedges in each muffin cup. Set aside. Muffins: In a large bowl, whisk together whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oats, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together brown sugar and eggs until well blended. Whisk in oil, orange juice and vanilla until blended. Stir in crushed pineapple. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just blended. Gently fold in carrots and raisins. Divide batter equally among prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 23 minutes or until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Immediately run a knife around edges of cups and turn muffins out onto a baking sheet. Reposition any stray pineapple pieces. Let cool for at least 10 minutes. Serve upside down, either warm or at room temperature.
