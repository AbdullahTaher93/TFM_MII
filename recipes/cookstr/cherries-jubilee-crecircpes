Prepare the crêpes. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter until it foams. Sprinkle in the sugar and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the water and wine and cook until it reduces to the consistency of a syrup. Add the cherries, heat through, and stir in the lemon juice. Fold the crêpes into triangles and add them to the skillet, coating them in the sauce. Push the crêpes to one side. Heat the brandy, ignite with a match, and spoon the flaming brandy over the sauce. When the flames subside, serve 2 crêpes and a spoonful or two of sauce on each plate. Top with a dollop of frozen yogurt or ice cream. Serve at once.
