Halve and peel the pumpkin, and remove the pulp and seeds. Cut into one-by-two-inch blocks. Slice on a mandoline into one-eighth-inch slices. Transfer the pumpkin slices into a four-quart bowl or gallon jar. You should have two to three quarts of loosely packed slices. Place the remaining ingredients in a nonreactive two-quart saucepan. Bring the liquid to a boil and pour over the pumpkin slices, making sure to cover them. Place a plate on top to keep the pumpkin submerged. Refrigerate. The pickles will be ready in two days.
