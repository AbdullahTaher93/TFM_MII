Combine 4 cups water with the olive oil and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the rice, stir, reduce the heat to medium, and cover the pan. Cook until all the liquid has been absorbed, 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the ham into Â¼-inch dice. Fluff the rice with a fork. Add the pineapple and toss to combine. Then add the ham, scallions, carrot, soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons of the reserved pineapple juice and transfer it to a serving bowl. Shortly before serving, add the peas and the chives and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
