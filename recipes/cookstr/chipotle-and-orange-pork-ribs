Combine the onions, chipotles, marmalade, brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, olive oil, and cumin in a medium-size bowl and mix until smooth; brush over both sides of the ribs. Arrange the ribs in the slow cooker, pouring over any extra sauce. If you have a round cooker, stack the ribs with sauce in between the layers. Cover and cook on LOW until tender and the meat starts to separate from the bone, 8 to 10 hours. Serve immediately.
