To make the vinaigrette, in a small bowl, combine the vinegar, shallot, and a little salt and pepper. Let stand while you get the salad ready. Just before using, whisk in the olive oil to make a vinaigrette. In a salad bowl, combine the persimmons, radicchio, arugula, and about two-thirds of the cheese. Drizzle the vinaigrette over the top and toss to coat evenly. Scatter the remaining cheese and the pomegranate seeds over the top and serve.
