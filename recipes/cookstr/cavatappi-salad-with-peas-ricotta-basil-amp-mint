In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions. Two minutes before the pasta is finished cooking, add Â½ cup of the peas to the pasta water. Drain the pasta and peas and set aside, mixing in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to keep the pasta from sticking together. Meanwhile, in a food processor, mix the ricotta, garlic, the remaining green peas, plus the mint and basil, until the mixture forms a paste. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the paste while it is processing. When the pasta has cooled, toss in the ricotta paste and pine nuts and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with the Parmesan cheese. Serve at room temperature.
