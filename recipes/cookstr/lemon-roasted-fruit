Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In a medium bowl, combine butter, lemon juice and honey. Toss with pineapple to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes or up to 3 hours. Place pineapple in prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until fruit is warmed and tender. (The time will differ greatly depending on the fruit you use.) Serve cooked pineapple on individual dessert plates topped with a spoonful of Ginger Ricotta Cream, if desired. Garnish with a mint sprig, if using.
