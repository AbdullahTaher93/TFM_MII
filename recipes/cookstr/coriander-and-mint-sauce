Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add half the mint and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the liquid through a sieve into a small bowl, making sure to press out as much of the liquid from the mint as possible. Add the sugar and coriander seeds and stir until the sugar dissolves. Transfer to a food processor, add the rest of the mint and the cilantro, and process until smooth. If desired, add more cilantro to taste.
