Cook the pineapple: With a sharp knife, remove the top and bottom of the pineapple. Stand the fruit up and carve the skin off in long, slow strokes. Slice the carved pineapple down the center and lay each half, flat side down, on a cutting board. Cut the halves into ¼ to ½ inch-thick semicircles. In a stainless-steel-lined saucepan, combine the sliced pineapple, sugar, and 2 cups cold water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Add the rosemary and remove the pan from the heat. Make sure the rosemary is submerged in the liquid, cover the pan, and set it aside for 10 minutes. Puree and strain the pineapple: Remove and discard the rosemary. Scoop half of the pineapple and some of the cooking syrup into a food processor or blender and puree on the highest speed for 2 minutes. Transfer the puree to a bowl and repeat the process with the remaining pineapple. Pass the pureed pineapple through a fine-mesh strainer and into a stainlesssteel bowl, pushing the fruit through the strainer with the back of a ladle or a rubber spatula. Discard the pulp. Place the bowl in an ice bath to chill. Once the mixture is chilled, add the lime juice. The sorbet base will be sweet. Some of the sweetness will be tamed by the freezing process, but if you fi nd the sorbet base cloyingly sweet, add more lime juice. If the sorbet base does not seem that sweet, try adding a few teaspoons of superfine sugar. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill for a minimum of 1 hour or up to 2 days. Churn the sorbet: Churn the sorbet in an ice cream machine according to the machine manufacturer’s directions. The sorbet is finished once it has increased in volume and it holds whisk lines from the stirring mechanism and mounds like softly whipped cream. Transfer to the freezer for 4 hours to attain a scoopable consistency. Serving Suggestions: Serve this sorbet with a crunchy cookie or wafer or some fresh fruit.
