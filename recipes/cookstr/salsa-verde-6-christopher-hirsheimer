In a mortar, combine the garlic and salt and crush together with the pestle. Add the anchovies and capers and pound until a paste forms. Add the parsley, in batches, pounding the leaves with each addition to incorporate. Transfer to a bowl, add the lemon zest and juice, and mix with a fork. Add 1/3 cup olive oil and mix again. Taste for balance. If it is too tart, add a little more olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Use immediately, or float a little olive oil on top to preserve the color. It can be left at room temperature for a few hours if treated this way.
