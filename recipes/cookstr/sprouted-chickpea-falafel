Place the almonds in a food processor and chop until they are a fine powder. Add all of the remaining ingredients and chop until well-blended to create a doughy consistency. With wet hands, form the dough into balls ½-inch in diameter. Place the balls on dehydrator screens and dehydrate at 105°F for 4 hours. If the dough seems a bit runny, use a Teflex sheet on top of the screens. (If you don’t own a dehydrator, see Notes for instructions on how to use an oven for this purpose.) Roll each ball over and dehydrate for an additional 4 hours, or until the falafel reach the desired crunchiness. 4. Arrange the falafel on a platter and serve.
