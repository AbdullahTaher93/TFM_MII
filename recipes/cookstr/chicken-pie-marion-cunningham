Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Slowly add the broth, cream, pepper, and salt to taste. Cook for 5 minutes, until thickened and smooth. Put the chicken pieces in a deep pie pan or casserole, cover with the sauce, and stir in the onions, peas, carrots, and celery. Roll out the prepared pie dough and place it over the casserole, allowing enough overhang so that the edges can be tucked under and crimped. Cut vents in the dough to allow the steam to escape. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned.
