For the almond and honey dressing, place the almonds and butter in a 4-cup capacity saucepan. Place over medium heat and gently warm until the butter starts to foam. Keep it on the heat and when the butter turns a hazelnut color (beurre noisette), add the honey. Bring to a boil, then reduce by one-fifth. Add the vinegar, orange-flower water and lemon juice, bring to a boil, turn down the heat and cook gently for 3 minutes. Pull off the heat, add the chili, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and mix thoroughly. Set aside to cool. This dressing will keep in the fridge for up to 2 months--just gently warm before using. Place the carrots in a saucepan of cold salted water and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook for 8 minutes or until tender. Test the carrots with a sharp knife to see if they're cooked. Drain, then while the carrots are still hot, cut the larger ones in half, place in a bowl and toss in 3 tablespoons of the dressing. To assemble, place one-quarter of the yogurt on each plate, then assemble the carrots on top. Dress with a little more dressing (making sure to scoop some of the almonds up) and scatter over the herbs and flowers.
