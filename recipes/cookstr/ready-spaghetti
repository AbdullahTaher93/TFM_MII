In a large skillet over medium heat, combine beef, onion, and garlic and sautÃ©, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until meat is browned and vegetables are tender, 6 to 7 minutes, adding a little oil if needed. Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, wine, basil, oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper and simmer, uncovered, until flavors are blended, 10 to 20 minutes. Serve over spaghetti, sprinkled with Parmesan.
