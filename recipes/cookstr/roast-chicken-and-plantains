Heat the oven to 450°F. Spread ¼ cup of the Ancho Chili Sauce on the bottom of a roasting pan. Place the chicken pieces, skin side up, in the roasting pan. Spread another ¼ cup Ancho Chili Sauce over the top of the chicken and salt lightly. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Baste the chicken pieces with the pan juices and bake for 10 minutes more. Baste the chicken again. Add the plantains to the pan. Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the meat is beginning to pull away from the bones. 20 to 25 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let cool enough to handle. Shred the chicken; discard the skin and bones. To assemble, place about 1/3 cup of the chicken and plantains in the center of a tortilla. Top with some of the remaining Ancho Chili Sauce, Toasted Pumpkin Seeds, chopped avocado, sour cream and cilantro sprigs. Fold and serve.
