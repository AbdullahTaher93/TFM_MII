Boil the boniato in salted water to cover (at least 2 quarts) until very tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the boniato and return to the pan. Mash the boniato to a coarse purée with a potato masher or fork. Work in the cream, stock, coffee liqueur, salt pepper, and nutmeg. The mixture should be highly seasoned and moist. If necessary, add a little more stock. Spoon the boniato mixture into a lightly buttered 8-inch gratin dish. Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and dot with the butter. (The recipe can be prepared several hours ahead to this stage.) Preheat the oven to 400°F. Just before serving, bake the gratin until crusty and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
