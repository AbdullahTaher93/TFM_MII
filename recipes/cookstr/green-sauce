In a large skillet, simmer green tomatoes with chiles, 1 garlic clove, and 2 tablespoons cilantro for 5 minutes; do not overcook tomatillos; they should remain firm. When sauce cools, add onion, remaining garlic clove, remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro, and salt. Puree in blender. Variation: A variation of this sauce can be prepared by cooking only 8 green tomatoes and then adding 8 raw tomatillos to blender.
