Preheat the oven to 425°. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and add the green onion, garlic, and bell pepper. Simmer for 1 minute, and whisk in the flour. Simmer for an additional minute. Whisk in the heavy cream, raise the heat, and whisk continuously until the sauce comes to a boil and thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk vigorously. Stir in the egg yolk, mustard, chili sauce, and lemon juice and refrigerate to chill. Stir in the basil, salt, and crab meat and form into 12 patties. Set aside. Combine the bread, herbs, and pepper in the bowl of the food processor and process to fine crumbs. Coat the crab cakes in the crumbs. Place on a buttered baking sheet, drizzle with the ½ cup of melted butter, and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until they’re golden and hot. VARIATION Two pounds shredded smoked fish (bluefish, whiting, salmon) may be substituted for the crab to make smoked fish cakes.
