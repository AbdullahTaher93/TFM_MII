In the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the sour cream and cream cheese until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice until thoroughly combined. Add the cottage cheese, pepperoncini, parsley, lemon zest, garlic powder and salt. Pulse several times to combine. The dip should be chunky, not smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately.
