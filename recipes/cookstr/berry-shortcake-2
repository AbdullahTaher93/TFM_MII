Beat the cream until somewhat stiff, add the sugar and vanilla, and continue to beat until stiff. Set the whipped cream aside in the refrigerator. (If you’re on a diet, you can omit this step.) In a food processor or blender purée the thawed raspberries with their syrup and set aside. Stem and rinse the fresh berries. Crumble 2 to 3 cookies in the bottom of each of four 1-cup dessert bowls. Top with the raspberry purée and then the fresh berries. Finish it off with the whipped cream. Cover each bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until dinner, at least I hour (this dessert can be made up to a day ahead of time). Variation If you’re making this in winter, substitute 2 oranges and 2 bananas for the fresh berries. You’ll still need the frozen raspberries to moisten the cookies and create that instant “cakey” feel to the dessert.
