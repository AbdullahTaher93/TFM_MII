1) Combine all the ingredients except the fish in a bowl. 2) Wash the fish, pat dry, then put it in the marinade. Turn it once or twice so that all sides come in contact with the liquid. If you have time and the fillet is thick, let the fish sit in the marinade for up to 30 minutes. 3) Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. 4) Place the fish in a baking dish. Pour the marinade over the fish until the liquid comes about halfway up the sides of the fillet. 5) Bake until done. Many fillets take only 7 minutes to cook, although a thick piece of haddock might require 15 minutes.
