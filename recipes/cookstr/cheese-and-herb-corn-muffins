Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the first 5 (dry) ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir together. Make a well in the center and pour in the yogurt, oil, and rice milk. Stir until well combined, adding more rice milk as needed to make a smooth, slightly stiff batter. Fold in the grated cheese, corn kernels, and herbs. Divide the batter among 12 lightly oiled or paper-lined muffin tins. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of one tests clean. Cool on a rack, then store in an airtight container as soon as the muffins are at room temperature.
