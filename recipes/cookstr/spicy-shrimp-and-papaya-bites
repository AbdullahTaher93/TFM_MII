Combine pineapple juice, lime juice, caribe chile, sesame oil, hot pepper sauce, garlic and coconut in a medium bowl. Add the shrimp and stir to combine. Cover and marinate 2 hours in the refrigerator, stirring at least twice. Preheat the grill to medium, or 350 F. Place the rack 4 to 5 inches above the heat source. Just before grilling, lightly brush the rack with oil. Place a chunk of papaya and a shrimp on each skewer. Drizzle with marinade. Place skewers on the hot oiled rack and grill 1 Â½ to 2 minutes on each side or until the shrimp are pink.
