Place a large pot on medium-high heat and let it get hot, about 45 seconds. Add the olive oil and the onion, celery, carrots, and bell pepper. Sauté, stirring often, until the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic. Stir and cook for 1 minute more. Increase the heat to high, add the wine, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 cups water, and the basil, parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper to taste. 4. When the sauce begins to bubble, turn the heat down to low, cover the pot half way, and let the sauce simmer, stirring occasionally for at least 45 minutes, until it begins to thicken. Longer cooking time makes for a thicker, more intensely flavored sauce. Variations Variations With meat: Brown 1 pound chopped beef, veal, or a combination of the two in a frying pan over high heat for 5-6 minutes. Transfer the meat to a colander to let the fat drain off. Add the meat to the sauce when you add the crushed tomatoes. With sausage: Brown ½ pound sweet Italian sausage meat in a frying pan over high heat for 5-6 minutes breaking it up into small chunks as it cooks. Transfer the meat to a colander to let the fat drain off. Add the sausage to the sauce when you add the crushed tomatoes. Sausage can also be used in combination with ground beef. With mushrooms: Thinly slice ¾ pound white or wild mushrooms or a combination of the two. Sauté these with the other vegetables.
