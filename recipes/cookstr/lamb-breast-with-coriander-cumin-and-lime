Make the lamb: Preheat the oven to 250°F. Combine the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and peppercorns in a blender, spice grinder, or mortar and pestle and grind into medium-fine powder. Stir in the salt until incorporated. Rub the entire lamb breast with the spice mix. If there is any left over after you've coated every crevice, save it for next time or try adding it to popcorn. Put the lamb, fat side up, on a sheet pan fitted with a rack and roast until the bones slide out easily and the meat is super tender, about 6 hours. Remove the lamb from the oven and remove and discard the rib bones while the meat is warm. Let rest for at least 15 minutes. HOLD IT? The lamb will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days. Increase the oven temperature to 450°F. Portion cooled lamb into rectangular pieces. The thickness may vary, but that's okay. Place the lamb pieces in a single layer on a sheet pan and roast until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. PLATE IT! I like to serve these guys in a big pile for people to grab. Garnish with the lime wedges and the culantro or cilantro. BREAK IT: If you can't find lamb breast, use this same rub and technique on lamb shanks, though they won't be as rich or fatty.
