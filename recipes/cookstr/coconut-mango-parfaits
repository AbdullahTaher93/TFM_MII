To make the custard, in a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water. In a wok over medium-high heat, combine ¾ cup of the cream and the vanilla, sugar, and butter. Add the cornstarch and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture begins to boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the Coconut and sour cream. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. In 4 parfait glasses, layer the crumbled cookies evenly with the custard and mango. Use as many cookies as you’d like, depending on whether you prefer a lot of cookie crunch or just little. In a mixing bowl, using a wooden spoon or an electric mixer, beat the remaining ½ cup whipping cream with the confectioners’ sugar. Top each parfait with some whipped cream and serve.
