Combine the rice and water in a medium bowl and soak 20 minutes. Drain and reserve the water. Set the rice and water aside separately. Meanwhile, toast the saffron in a small frying pan over medium heat, stirring and pulling the pan off the heat occasionally to keep the saffron from burning, until the saffron darkens to a maroon color and is fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds. Crush to a coarse powder in a mortar and pestle, or in a bowl with the back of a spoon. Stir in the milk or cream, and set aside. Combine the ghee or oil, cinnamon stick, cardamom, and ginger in a medium heavy-bottomed casserole over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until the cinnamon unfurls, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the currants and nuts and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the drained rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the reserved water, turn down the heat, cover, and simmer very gently over low heat for 15 minutes. Now uncover and sprinkle the rice evenly with the sugar. Drizzle the saffron mixture over the top. Put the pan over very low heat, cover, and continue cooking 5 more minutes. Serve hot.
