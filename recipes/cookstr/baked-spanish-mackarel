Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Place a piece of aluminum foil large enough to envelop the fish on a baking sheet. Line the foil with a large sheet of parchment paper. Brush the bottom of the parchment with melted butter and place the fish on top. Stuff the cavity with the citrus zest and sprig of rosemary. Scatter all of the remaining ingredients except the anchovies on and around the fish. Arrange the anchovies on top of the fish in herringbone fashion. Tightly wrap the fish in the parchment and foil and bake for 10 minutes for every inch of thickness. Place on a platter and serve.
