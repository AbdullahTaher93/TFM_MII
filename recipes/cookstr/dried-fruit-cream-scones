Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Use an ungreased baking sheet. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl, stirring with a fork to mix well. Add the dried fruit and raisins. Still using a fork, stir in the cream and mix until the dough holds together in a rough mass (the dough will be quite sticky). Lightly flour a board and transfer the dough to it. Knead the dough 8 or 9 times. Pat into a circle about 10 inches round. For the glaze, spread the butter over the top and side of the circle of dough and sprinkle the sugar on top. Cut the circle into 12 wedges and place each piece on the baking sheet, allowing about an inch between pieces. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
