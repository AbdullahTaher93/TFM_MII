In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and onion; cook for 3 minutes or until softened. Stir in carrot and celery; cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until vegetables are softened. Add beef, pork, pancetta, chicken livers and nutmeg; cook, stirring to break up meat, for 10 minutes or until meat is browned. Stir in red wine. Bring to a boil; cook for 5 minutes. Stir together tomato paste and ½ cup (125 mL) warm water; stir into meat mixture. Return to a boil, reduce heat to low and stir in salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 1 ½ to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, or until meat is very tender. If ragù appears too dry as it cooks, add a little more water or wine. When ragù is almost finished, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in coarse salt. Cook pasta until tender but firm; drain and transfer to a warmed serving bowl. Pour ragù over pasta; toss to coat. Serve immediately, sprinkled with Parmigiano-Reggiano.
