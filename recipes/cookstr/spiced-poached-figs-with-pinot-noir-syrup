Prepare the syrup: In a nonreactive saucepan, combine all the ingredients except the figs and Crême Anglaise and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Cool. Reheat the mixture to a simmer, add the figs, and poach for 4 to 5 minutes until they begin to puff up. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the figs to a shallow baking pan and let cool. Place syrup back over high heat and simmer vigorously over high heat for about 30 minutes until reduced to 1 cup. Cool. Serve the figs with the syrup and accompanied by Crême Anglaise.
