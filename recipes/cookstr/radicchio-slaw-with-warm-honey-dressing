Cut the radicchio into 4 wedges through the core, then remove the core. Slice the leaves into 1/8-inch-wide ribbons. Halve the cabbage through the core, remove the core, and slice like the radicchio. Put the radicchio and cabbage in a large bowl, cover with ice water, and soak for 20 minutes. Drain and repeat. Drain again, pat dry, and set aside. Trim the thick stems from the watercress and set aside. Make the dressing: Toast the fennel seed in a small skillet over moderately low heat until fragrant and lightly colored, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool, then crush the seed in a mortar or grind in a spice grinder. Combine the honey, vinegar, and ground fennel in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until the honey dissolves. Remove from the heat and whisk in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss the radicchio, cabbage, and watercress in a large bowl. Add enough of the warm dressing to coat the salad; you may not need it all. Toss well, then taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately.
