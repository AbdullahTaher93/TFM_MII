Whisk in potato. Using a spoon or rubber spatula, stir in dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk, making three additions of dry and two of buttermilk, just until combined. Spread batter in prepared pan, smoothing top. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until top springs back when touched lightly. Let cool in pan on a rack for 10 minutes.
