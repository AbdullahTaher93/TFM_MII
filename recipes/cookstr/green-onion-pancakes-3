Combine the flours and about ¾ cup cold water, adding water a little bit at a time and mixing until the mixture is the consistency of thin pancake batter. Add the green onions and optional black pepper and mix. In a large skillet or on a griddle, add just enough vegetable oil to thinly cover the surface, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the heat to medium high. Add ½ the batter onto the frying pan in a large flat circle. Cook on one side until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side. Lower the heat as necessary to prevent burning, adding more oil as needed. Remove the pancake. Pour the remaining batter and repeat. Cut the pancake into 4 or 8 pieces. Serve hot with Seasoned Soy Sauce (Yangnyum Ganjang) or Vinegar Soy Sauce (Cho Ganjang).
