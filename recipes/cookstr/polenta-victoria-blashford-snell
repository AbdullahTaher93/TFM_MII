In a large saucepan, heat the stock over high heat until almost boiling. Gradually whisk in the polenta, then continue to whisk about 3 minutes, until the mixture is thick and soft. Add a little more stock or water, if necessary. Stir in the butter and Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
