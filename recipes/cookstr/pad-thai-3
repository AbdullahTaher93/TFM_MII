Soak the rice sticks in cold water to cover for 30 minutes, or until pliable. Combine the lime juice, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and hot sauce in a small bowl and whisk to mix. Just before serving, drain the rice sticks. Heat a wok over high heat. Swirl in the oil. Add the garlic, ginger, scallion whites, and chilies, and stir-fry for 15 seconds, or until fragrant. Add the chicken, shrimp, pepper, onion, and carrots, and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked. Stir in the rice sticks and bean sprouts, and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the sauce and cook for 30 seconds, or until the rice sticks are tender. Correct the seasoning, adding fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar to taste. The dish should be a little sweet, a little sour, and a little salty. Transfer the pad thai to a platter or plates. Sprinkle with the scallion greens and peanuts, and serve at once.
