Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Put the tomatoes into a roasting pan, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 1 hour, or until slightly dried and caramelized. To make the dressing, place the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk together until thickened slightly. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cut each chicken breast into 4 pieces. Top each with a sage leaf, then wrap as tightly as possible with a piece of pancetta. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and brown the chicken pieces on each side. Lower the heat and continue to cook the chicken, turning, for 10 minutes, or until cooked through. Serve the chicken with the greens and the roasted tomatoes, drizzled with the dressing.
