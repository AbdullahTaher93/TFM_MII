In a large skillet, heat the ¼ cup olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and sauté until translucent, about 1 minute. Add the artichoke slices and thyme and cook, stirring, until the artichokes start to brown. This should take a few minutes. Add the wine and season with salt and pepper, continuing to stir the contents. Turn the heat down to medium-low. Once the white wine evaporates, begin adding the stock ¼ cup at a time, allowing the artichokes to absorb the stock before adding more. When the artichokes are tender, after 7 to 10 minutes, add the fava beans and peas and cook for a minute or so, just until tender. About 10 minutes before the sauce is ready, add salt to the boiling water and then add the pasta and cook until al dente. Scoop out and reserve 2 ladles of the pasta water and then drain the pasta. Pour the drained pasta into the skillet with the artichoke, fava, and pea mixture over medium heat. Season again with salt and pepper and turn the mixture gently to combine the sauce and pasta. If the mixture seems. A little dry, add some of the reserved pasta water (or stock if you have it). Transfer the pasta to a warmed serving bowl. Sprinkle a little of the cheese on top along with the mint, and then drizzle with olive oil. Pass the rest of the cheese at the table.
