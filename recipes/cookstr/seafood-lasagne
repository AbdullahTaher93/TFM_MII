Heat the oil in a medium skillet; add the leek; sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and paste. Cook, stirring and breaking tomatoes with the side of a spoon, until mixture boils. Simmer, uncovered, until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the shrimp, scallops, and fish fillet; add a few pieces of the tom basil leaves. Cover and cook over low heat 10 minutes. Do not boil or overcook. Meanwhile, cook the lasagne noodles in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, or firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Place noodles in a large bowl of cool water until ready to use. Heat oven to 350°F. Select a 9 × 13-inch shallow baking dish. Spoon ½ cup of the sauce into the bottom of the dish. Lift the lasagne noodles individually from the water and blot dry on paper toweling. Arrange a single layer of 5 overlapping noodles on the bottom of the dish. Spoon a third of the sauce and seafood over the noodles. Sprinkle with a third of the basil and top with a third of the mozzarella. Repeat with the next two layers. Bake until the cheese is bubbly and edges browned, about 50 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting and serving.
