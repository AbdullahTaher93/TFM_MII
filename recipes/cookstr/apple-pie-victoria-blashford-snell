Place a baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 400°F (200°C). Mix the lemon zest and juice in a large bowl. Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples, and toss them with the lemon mixture as they are sliced. Add the sugar, flour, and pumpkin pie spice and mix well. Line a 9in (23cm) pie pan with a pie crust and brush the edge with water. Spread the apple filling in the pan. Center the second pie crust over the filling. Press the edges of the crusts together to seal them, then flute them. Brush the top of the pie crust with milk and cut a few slits in the crust. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet. Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Bake the pie for 50–55 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown. Transfer the pie to a wire cake rack and cool for at least 1 hour. Cut into wedges and serve warm, or cool completely and serve at room temperature.
