Mix the dry ingredients in a medium bowl. Whisk coconut milk, eggs, and 3/8 cup of the oil together in another bowl, and then whisk them into the flour mixture until well combined. Pour ½ teaspoon of the remaining oil into a 9-inch skillet over high heat. When the oil shimmers, pour ¼ cup batter into the pan (or use 2 tablespoons to make each silver dollar pancake) and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the edges are crisp and many bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip over with a spatula and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer the pancake to a plate and put in a slightly warm oven. Add another ½ teaspoon of oil to the pan; repeat until all the batter is used.
