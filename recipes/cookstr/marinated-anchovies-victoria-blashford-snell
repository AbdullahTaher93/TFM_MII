To fillet anchovies, cut off heads and tails. Cut a slit along the underside of each fish and discard the innards. Open out each fish and remove the central bone by lifting the tail end and pulling upwards. Wash the anchovies and remove any stray bones. Pat dry with paper towels. Place half the anchovy fillets in a single layer in a shallow dish. Sprinkle with 1Â½ tsp salt. Arrange the remaining anchovies at right angles over the first layer. Sprinkle with the remaining salt. Add enough vinegar to barely cover them. Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Pour off the vinegar, rinse the anchovies in cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange the anchovies in a shallow serving dish and pour the olive oil over them. Sprinkle with the garlic and parsley. Serve chilled. Variation Lemon-marinated Anchovies: Cover the anchovies with the zest and juice of 2 lemons and marinate for 2 hours, then continue with the recipe from step 3.
