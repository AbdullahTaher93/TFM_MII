In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat the ginger and garlic with the canola oil until they start to sizzle steadily, about 2 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring often, until it softens and heats through, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken, ham, and peas and cook until heated though, about 2 minutes. Make a well in the center of the rice and add the eggs. Cook, stirring a few times, until the egg starts to set, then break it up with a spatula into small pieces. Stir the mixture together, drizzle with the sesame oil, season with salt to taste, toss well, and serve immediately.
