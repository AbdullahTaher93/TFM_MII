Blanch the spinach leaves in boiling water for 2 minutes, then refresh in cold water, drain, and chop very finely. Put a small frying pan over low heat and dry-fry the cumin for 2–3 minutes, or until fragrant. Remove, dry-fry the coriander, then the fenugreek for 2–3 minutes each, or until fragrant. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium heat and fry the onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, and fenugreek for 10–12 minutes, or until golden and aromatic. Stir in the tomato, ginger, and garam masala and bring to a boil. Add the spinach and cook until the liquid has almost evaporated. Fold in the paneer, trying to keep it in whole pieces. Stir gently until heated through. Season with salt to taste.
