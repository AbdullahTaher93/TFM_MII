In a 12-inch skillet over high heat, saut√© the scallions and onions in the vegetable oil. Season the catfish liberally with salt and pepper. Add the fish to the pan, and cook for 5 minutes over medium heat; add the fermented black bean garlic sauce and water or stock. Simmer a few minutes until the fish is tender, then thicken the sauce with the cornstarch mixture. When the sauce has thickened, serve the dish over rice or rice noodles.
