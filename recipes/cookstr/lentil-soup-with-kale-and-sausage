In a large nonstick saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. If sausage is wrapped in casing, discard casing. Crumble sausage into the saucepan, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add broth and kale. Bring to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Stir in lentils and salt and simmer for 5 minutes longer. Ladle into six bowls and sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon Parmesan before serving.
