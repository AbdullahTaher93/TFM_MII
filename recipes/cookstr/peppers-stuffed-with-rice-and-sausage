Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the whole bell peppers and sauté until colored on all sides but still firm to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes. If they do not all fit into the pan at once, sauté them in batches to give them enough room to color properly. Remove from the heat and let cool. Slice the top off each pepper and reserve the tops. Scoop out and discard the seeds and ribs, being careful not to pierce the walls of the peppers, and set aside. Drain off all but 2 table spoons of the oil in the pan (reserve the drained oil) and place the pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until it softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the 1-¾ cups stock, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Taste for salt. Meanwhile, in a second skillet, sauté the sausage meat in a little of the oil reserved from browning the peppers (if necessary, use additional olive oil) until it colors but is not hard, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the cooked rice, soppressata, fennel, parsley, parmigiano, and garlic. Taste for salt and pepper. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Fill the peppers with the rice mixture and insert a cube of mozzarella into the center of the stuffing. Replace the pepper tops. Oil a baking dish ample enough to hold all the peppers without crowding them. Arrange the stuffed peppers in the dish upright and add the 3 tablespoons stock to the dish. Cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil, dull side out, and bake in the oven until the peppers are tender but still hold their shape, about 30 minutes. Allow to settle for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Serve hot or warm.
