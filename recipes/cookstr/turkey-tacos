To Make the Fresh Tomato Salsa: In a medium bowl, stir together all ingredients. Cover and let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour to allow flavors to blend, then cover and store in refrigerator until ready to use. Drain, if necessary, before using. Homemade salsa is best eaten the same day as prepared. To Make the Tacos: Warm the tortillas (see Notes). Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm oil. Add turkey and saut√©, breaking up meat with a spoon, until meat is browned, about 5 minutes. Add salsa and seasonings and mix well. In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine beans and butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through. To assemble, cover a tortilla with a light coating of bean mixture. Add about 2 tablespoons meat mixture in a strip down the center. Add a spoonful of salsa and sour cream, a few chopped green onions, tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, and other toppings of your choice. Fold in half and serve immediately. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
