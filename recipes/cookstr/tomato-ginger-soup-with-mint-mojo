Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, ginger, and white wine. Simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the wine has nearly completely evaporated. Add the chicken broth and canned tomatoes. Simmer the soup for about 45 minutes, or until the ginger has mellowed and the vegetables are soft. Using a blender, an immersion blender, or a food processor, puree the soup until smooth, and then season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately or store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat the soup over medium heat. Top with a drizzle of Mint Mojo before serving. Like Cilantro-Garlic Mojo, this paste is a fragrant mix of herbs and spices that adds bold flavor to meat, fish, and poultry. Unlike sauces with butter or cream, mojos are a much lighter alternative. This mojo is a fresh and a natural partner for Char-Grilled Rack of Lamb with Cinnamon and Cumin. Combine the cilantro, mint, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and sugar in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse to a pestolike consistency. Use immediately or store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Mix well before using.
