Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the radishes, chives, horseradish, and salt and pepper to taste until blended. Refrigerate until firm. Preheat oven to 325°F. Cut sixty 1-inch hearts with a cookie cutter from the bread slices. Place in a single layer on baking sheets and bake until lightly toasted. Turn and toast the second side. Spread each toast heart with a thin layer of the radish cream cheese. Place ½ teaspoon of the salmon caviar on the top center of each heart. Garnish each heart with a little parsley sprig.
