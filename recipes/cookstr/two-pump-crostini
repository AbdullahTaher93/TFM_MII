Make the butter: Add the cream to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. If you have a splash guard, use it; otherwise you can drape the edge of the bowl with plastic wrap. Start the mixer on the slowest speed, then gradually increase the speed to the highest setting. Whisk the cream until peppercorn-size or larger bits of butter are floating in the milk, about 5 minutes. Line a colander with a clean dish towel and place it over a large mixing bowl. Pour the contents of the mixer bowl into the colander. Reserve the milk for drinking because it's rad. Place the butter back in the bowl of the stand mixer. Add the pumpkin pie filling and salt and mix until combined, about 1 minute. HOLD IT? Store the pumpkin butter in a covered container in the fridge until ready to use; it will keep for up to a week, or can be frozen for up to a month. You can also cut your bread ahead of time and store in an airtight container, ready to brush and toast (see next step). PLATE IT! Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Cut your bread into whatever shape you like. Drizzle or lightly brush the bread with olive oil on both sides. Place in a single layer on a sheet pan and bake, flipping once halfway through the baking, until crispy, 6 to 10 minutes. Allow the bread to cool slightly so the butter doesn't melt everywhere. Place a chilled rosette of butter on each piece of bread, or simply smear heavily with the pumpkin butter. Serve. CHEAT IT! If you don't have the time or energy to make your own butter, you can always replace the homemade butter with store-bought softened unsalted butter and mix it with the pumpkin pie filling and salt per above. BREAK IT: Some curry heat (1 to 2 tablespoons of curry powder) added to the mix would take this over the top.
