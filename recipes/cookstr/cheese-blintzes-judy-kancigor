Prepare the filling: Place the cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle, and beat on medium speed until it is fluffy, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs, sugar, and lemon zest, and continue beating just until combined, 30 seconds more. Then beat in the farmer cheese. Stir in the cottage cheese and combine thoroughly. To assemble the blintzes, place about 2 tablespoons of the filling on the lower half of the fried side of each crepe. Roll the crepe around the filling, folding the ends in as you go. The blintzes can either be fried or baked. To fry the blintzes, melt about 1½ teaspoons butter and 1½ teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add as many blintzes as will fit, seam side down, and fry them on all sides until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes altogether. Drain the blintzes on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining blintzes. To bake the blintzes, preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a nonreactive baking pan (a 13 × 9-inch pan will hold about 15) with butter, margarine, or shortening. Place the blintzes, seam side down, in the prepared baking pan and dot with more butter, margarine, or shortening. Bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Serve immediately.
