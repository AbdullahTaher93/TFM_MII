Make the Batter: Place the knotted pandan leaves and 1¼ cups water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Measure out 1 cup of the pandan water and allow it to cool to room temperature. If using pandan extract, stir it into 1 cup cool water and set aside. Move the grated cassava onto a kitchen towel. Bring together the ends of the cloth and twist to squeeze out as much liquid as you can. There won’t be much liquid, and it may simply be absorbed by the cloth. Place the cassava in a large bowl and break it up a little. Add the sugar and pandan water and mix well. Steam and coat the dumplings: Remove the basket from the steamer pot, add 2 inches of water to the pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Arrange as many dipping bowls in the basket as you can. Spoon enough batter into each bowl to fill them halfway. Place the basket in the pot, cover, and steam for 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Carefully remove the basket, place it on a folded kitchen towel, and allow the pichi-pichi to cool slightly. Meanwhile, spread the coconut out on a large plate. Working while they are still warm, unmold the pichi-pichi with a butter knife or a small spatula and place them on the plate of grated coconut. Turn and press all sides into the coconut, then arrange them on a serving plate. Repeat with any remaining batter. Serve warm or at room temperature. Pichi-pichi can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Allow them to come back to room temperature before serving.
