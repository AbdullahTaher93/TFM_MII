In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine 2½ cups of the flour and the yeast with a wire whisk. In a medium saucepan, heat the soy milk, sugar, shortening, and salt until warm, about 110°F. Add the soy milk mixture to the flour mixture, and beat on low for about 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl’s sides with a rubber spatula. Beat on high for an additional minute. Stir in the remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, to make a stiff, but pliable, dough. Turn the dough onto a floured board, and knead 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a bowl sprayed with dairy-free baking spray, turning to coat all sides. Cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Transfer the dough ball to a bowl sprayed with dairy-free baking spray, turning the dough to coat all sides. Cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down, and divide into 2 portions. Shape each portion into a ball, and place each on a lightly floured board. Cover with a kitchen towel, and let rest about 5 minutes. Place the dough into two 8-inch loaf pans sprayed generously with dairy-free baking spray. Cover the pans with kitchen towels, and let rise until doubled in bulk, 30 to 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes. Cool slightly, and then remove from pans onto wire rack to cool completely.
