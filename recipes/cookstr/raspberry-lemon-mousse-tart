Add the raisins and salt, and pulse until the mixture sticks together when pressed between your fingers. Press into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom (or a pie plate) and refrigerate or freeze to chill completely. For the mousse: Combine all ingredients in a high-speed blender and blend until smooth. To assemble and serve: Fill the chilled crust with the lemon mousse.
