Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly coat a 9-x-S-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil, clarified butter (see Notes), or cooking spray, or line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper, and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, raisins, sesame seeds, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Add the milk to the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly with a spoon until a stiff batter forms. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared loaf pan. Gently knock the bottom of the pan on your kitchen counter to remove any air pockets in the batter. Cover the pan with aluminum foil to keep the top of the loaf from splitting. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove the pan from oven, discard the foil, and return the pan to the oven. Bake for 30 additional minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool. Toast slices and serve them along with a non-hydrogenated margarine or Clarified Butter (see Notes).
