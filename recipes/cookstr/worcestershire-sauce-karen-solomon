Put the tamarind in a medium bowl, add 2/3 cup of warm water, and let sit for 10 minutes. Using your bare hands, squish the paste and water together into a liquid slurry Remove and discard all seeds and pods. In a large, clean, odorless jar with a tight lid, combine the tamarind slurry with all the remaining ingredients, plus Â¼ cup of water, and stir or shake to blend. Wrap the jar in brown paper or enclose in a brown paper bag and store in a cool, dark place for 2 weeks to allow the flavors to develop. Shake the contents of the jar every few days. After 2 weeks, strain the contents of the jar through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, pressing hard on the solids to harvest as much liquid as you can. Discard the solids. Using a funnel, pour the Worcestershire sauce into a pour-top or shaker-top bottle. Label and date the jar. Note that the liquid will settle and become more cloudy on the bottom; this is just the natural characteristic of the brew. The sauce will keep for 1 year covered in brown paper in a cool, dark spot in your pantry.
