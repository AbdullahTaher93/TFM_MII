If you’re using dried beans, soak them first for 6 hours or cover them with boiling water and soak them for an hour; then treat them like the fresh beans, as follows. Shell the beans; then put them in a sauté pan with the water, bay leaf, 3 of the sage leaves or half the dried sage, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Slice 1 of the garlic cloves and add it to the pan along with the carrot. Salt lightly and simmer gently until the beans are tender, about 30 minutes or possibly longer, depending on the maturity of the beans. Should they absorb all the water, add more as needed, including enough to leave some broth. When the beans are done, set them aside with their cooking liquid. Remove the tough stems of the greens and chop the leaves. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a skillet and gently wilt the onion. Finely chop the remaining garlic, chop the remaining sage leaves, and add them to the onion with the pepper flakes. Cook for a minute or 2; then add the greens. Lightly salt and add a little cooking water from the beans and cook until the greens are tender. Add the beans and enough liquid to make a nice sauce. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt to taste and the pasta and cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain and toss with the greens and the beans. Season to taste and serve with plenty of ground pepper, the remaining olive oil laced over the top, and freshly grated cheese.
