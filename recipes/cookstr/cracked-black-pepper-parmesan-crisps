Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a 12 × 15-inch (30 × 45-cm) baking sheet with foil and coat lightly with nonstick spray. Spread the Parmesan onto the baking sheet. Make sure that it’s spread evenly, or your crisps won’t bake evenly. Sprinkle with the black pepper and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese has turned a uniform deep golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool. Once it’s cool enough to handle, remove the cheese from the foil and crack it into rough, bite-sized pieces. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.
