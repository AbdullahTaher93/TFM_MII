Place all of the ingredients, except for the salt, into the slow cooker. Add water to cover by 2 to 3 inches. Cover and cook on HIGH for 1 hour. Uncover and skim off the foam on the surface. Cover, reduce heat setting to LOW, and cook for 8 to 12 hours. If the water cooks down below the level of the ingredients, add a bit of boiling water. Uncover and let cool to lukewarm. Set a large colander lined with cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and pour the broth through to strain. Press down on the vegetables to extract all the liquid. Discard the vegetables, skin, and bones. Taste the stock and add salt to taste. The broth is ready for use and can be refrigerated, tightly covered, for up to 3 days. The fat will separate and rise to the top; scoop off with a spoon and discard. Or divide the stock into airtight storage containers, leaving 2 inches at the top to allow for expansion, and freeze for up to 3 to 4 months.
