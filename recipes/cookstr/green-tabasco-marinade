In a small nonreactive bowl, whisk together the Tabasco sauce and wine. Set over low heat, and gradually whisk in the bacon drippings. Add the garlic, lemon juice and zest, salt, pepper, and jalapeno. Mix until well blended. The marinade will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
