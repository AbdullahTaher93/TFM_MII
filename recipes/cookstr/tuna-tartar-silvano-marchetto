Set 4 plates in the refrigerator to chill. Place the onion, capers, anchovies, and parsley on a cutting board and chop them together. Transfer to a stainless steel bowl large enough to hold the tuna. Cut the tuna into Â¼-inch/0.5-cm cubes and add to the onion mixture. Drizzle with the olive oil and gently toss. Add half of the lemon juice and gently toss. Taste and add more lemon juice until you like the level of acidity. Season with salt and pepper, being mindful that the anchovies are salty. Divide the tuna tartar among the 4 chilled plates, place 4 toast triangles around each portion, and serve.
