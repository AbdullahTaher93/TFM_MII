Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place them in the top of the double boiler. Fill the bottom of the double boiler with water and set the top in place. Set over moderately high heat and bring the water to a simmer. When the chocolate melts, remove from the heat. Dip a fork into the chocolate and flick the chocolate over clean snow in a back and forth motion. Do this several times to make a lattice of chocolate over the snow. Carefully pick up the lattice from the top of the snow and eat.
