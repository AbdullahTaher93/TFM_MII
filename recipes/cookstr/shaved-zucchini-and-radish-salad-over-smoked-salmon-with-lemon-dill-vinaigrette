Use a peeler to shave the zucchini lengthwise on each side until you start to hit the seedy middle part. Lay a couple of pieces of smoked salmon in the middle of a plate. Top the salmon layer with a heap of shaved zucchini, radish slices, and dill fronds. Whisk the dressing ingredients together until smooth. Drizzle the dressing over the top of each salad.
