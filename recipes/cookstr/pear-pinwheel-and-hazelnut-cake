Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan. Scatter the nuts on a baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly toasted. If using hazelnuts, wrap them in a tea towel and rub to remove the skins. In a food processor, combine the nuts and flour and process until finely ground. In a large bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar with a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, and almond extract and beat until smooth. Mix in the nut mixture. Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Cut the pears into slices 3/8 inch thick and place in a bowl. In a small bowl, combine the confectioners’ sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Stir to blend. Sprinkle the fruit with the confectioners’ sugar mixture, toss to coat, and arrange in a pinwheel on top of the batter. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Place the pan on a wire rack and let the cake cool completely. Remove the sides of the pan and cut the cake into wedges to serve.
