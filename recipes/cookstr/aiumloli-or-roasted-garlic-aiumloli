Place the garlic, salt, and yolks in a blender or food processor. With the blender on high speed or while the processor is running, slowly add the oil in a very thin stream until it is absorbed and an emulsion is formed. Adjust salt to taste. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Variation: Roasted Garlic Aïoli Replace the raw garlic with 12 to 14 cloves unpeeled garlic that have been roasted in a little oil in a 350°F. oven for ½ hour. Peel the garlic and proceed as above. Variation: Apple Aïoli Peel, core, seed, and cube 1 large green apple. Cook with 2 tablespoons water in a small pot just until soft and still chunky, about 5 minutes. Drain the apples if there is too much liquid. Prepare the aïoli as above, blending in the apple, but omit the eggs and reduce the oil by half. Serve as an accompaniment with pork.
