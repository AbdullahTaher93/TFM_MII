Melt butter in a 3-quart soup pot and swirl it around until it coats the entire surface. Heat over high heat for 1 minute. Add the leeks, potatoes, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until leeks and onion are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the Basic Vegetable Stock and Bouquet Garni. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmering and cook for 30 minutes. Remove pot from heat. Cool for 15 minutes. Remove Bouquet Garni. Use an immersion blender to puree soup right in the soup pot. Stir in salt. If you like, stir in white wine. Cook 5 minutes more. Season to taste with pepper.
