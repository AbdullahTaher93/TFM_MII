Soak the plank for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, salt, and pepper. Rub the ribs all over with the seasoning mixture. Place on a large plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. To make the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, jalapeno, garlic powder, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper and saute until the vegetables soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the blueberries, molasses, chili sauce, and vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 30 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a blender and puree until smooth. Be careful while blending the sauce, as it needs room for steam to escape; remove or open the center part of the blender lid and cover it with a damp towel while blending. The sauce can be prepared and refrigerated up to 3 days in advance. When you are ready to cook the ribs, bring them to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Place the ribs in a baking pan, cover them with foil, and bake until tender, about 1 1/2, hours. Once the ribs are cool enough to handle, remove them from the pan and generously brush each side of the ribs with 1/2 cup of the sauce. Prepare the plank for grilling according to the instructions (see Notes). Place the ribs on the toasted side of the plank. Close the lid and grill for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the ribs are crisp and lightly charred. Remove the ribs from the heat and brush with another 1/4 cup of the sauce. Cut the ribs apart and serve immediately with additional sauce on the side.
