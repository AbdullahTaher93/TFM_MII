Place the quinoa in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse thoroughly several times, swishing the grains with your hand. Drain well. Bring the water and salt to a boil in a saucepan and drop in the washed, drained quinoa. Stir once and let the water return to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 12 to 16 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the individual grains have turned translucent, bordered by the white germ, making tiny little stars if you look closely. Turn off the heat and let stand for a few minutes. Fluff and serve.
