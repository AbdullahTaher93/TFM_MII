Combine the spinach and frisée in a large bowl near the stove. In another small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, and honey. Put the bacon matchsticks (lardons) in a sauté pan over medium-low heat and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the lardons, reserving 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat. Keep the bacon warm. In a nonstick sauté pan, melt the butter over medium heat and cook the eggs either over easy or sunny side up. Set the eggs aside. In a sauté pan over medium heat, gently heat the reserved bacon fat and the olive oil. Add the garlic and sauté for a minute or two, until aromatic. Carefully whisk in the vinegar mixture and turn the heat to high. As the dressing begins to boil, keep whisking until it emulsifies. When the dressing is hot, remove the pan from the heat and immediately pour it over the spinach and frisée. Add the reserved warm lardons, season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss well. Divide the salad among 6 warm plates, top each portion with a fried egg, and serve immediately.
