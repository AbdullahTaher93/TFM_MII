Start a charcoal or wood fire or preheat a gas grill or broiler; the fire should be moderately hot. Or heat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 or 4 minutes before you start cooking, then sprinkle it with coarse salt. Cut the cheese into 4 pieces and form the meat into patties around each one; season with salt and pepper. Grill, broil, or pan-grill, 2 to 4 inches from the heat source, for about 3 or 4 minutes per side, or until the outside feels very firm. If you like your meat on the well-done side, move the burgers to a lower heat and cook an additional minute or two longer per side. 3.
