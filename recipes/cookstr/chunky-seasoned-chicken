Pour the oil into an extra-deep 12-inch skillet, and place it over medium heat. Peel and coarsely chop the onions, adding them to the skillet as you chop. Cook, stirring occasionally, while you cut the chicken into roughly Â½-inch cubes. When all of the chicken is cut, add it to the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 7 to 9 minutes. Add the garlic and Worcestershire sauce to the skillet and stir until well blended, about 30 seconds. Remove the skillet from the heat and allow the chicken to cool enough to be refrigerated or frozen for future use.
