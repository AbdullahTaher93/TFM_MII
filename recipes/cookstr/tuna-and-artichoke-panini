Preheat panini grill to high In a bowl, combine tuna, artichokes, red pepper, basil, olives, capers, mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Place rolls, cut side down, on a work surface and brush crusts with oil. Turn rolls over and, on bottom halves, evenly layer with tuna mixture, onion and tomato. Cover with top halves and press gently to pack. Place sandwiches in grill, close the top plate and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.
