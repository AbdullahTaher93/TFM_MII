Whisk in the oil in a slow, steady stream until emulsified and smooth. Set aside. Peel and pit the avocados, cut into Â½-inch dice, and toss with the lemon juice. In a large bowl, combine the rice, beans, onion, chiles, and avocados. Add the dressing and toss gently to combine. Line plates or shallow bowls with lettuce leaves and top with the salad.
