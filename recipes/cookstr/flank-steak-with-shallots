Peel the shallots and cut into thin slices. Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of the oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add the shallots, and cook until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the herbs, pepper, and vermouth. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover the pan, turn up the heat, and boil the liquid until reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat, season with salt and additional pepper; set aside. Prepare coals for grilling or preheat the broiler. Pat the steak dry, then lightly coat it with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Grill or broil the steak until seared and nicely browned on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook 4 minutes more for rare or 5 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer the steak to a carving board and let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, reheat the shallots. Carve the steak on the bias across the grain into very thin slices. Season lightly with salt, if desired, and divide among warm plates. Spoon the shallots and their liquid over the meat and serve at once.
