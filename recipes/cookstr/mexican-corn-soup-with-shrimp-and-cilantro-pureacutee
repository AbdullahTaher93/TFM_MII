Heat the beer, 2 cups of the water, the bay leaf, and red pepper flakes in a 2-quart saucepan to boiling. Add the shrimp and cook just until done, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the shrimp and return the cooking liquid to the saucepan. Boil the cooking liquid over high heat until reduced by one-half. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots, and bell pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 15 minutes. Stir in the oregano, cumin, thyme, and flour. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add the reduced cooking liquid, the clam juice, remaining 1½ cups water, and the corn to the pot. Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Cut each shrimp into 4 pieces and add half the shrimp to the soup. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream, milk, and lime juice. Purée the soup in batches in a blender. Press through a sieve or food mill back into the pot. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the remaining shrimp and keep warm over low heat. Prepare the cilantro puree: Place the chiles, cilantro, and oil in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until smooth. Ladle the soup into serving bowls and swirl a couple tablespoons of the cilantro purée on top of each serving.
