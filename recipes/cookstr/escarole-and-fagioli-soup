Heat the oil in a 2-quart saucepan. Add the salt pork and saute until it releases its fat and begins to brown. Stir in the escarole, cover, and let cook 3 to 5 minutes, until the leaves wilt. Season with hot pepper flakes. Add the beans, water, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve with lots of pepper and Parmesan.
