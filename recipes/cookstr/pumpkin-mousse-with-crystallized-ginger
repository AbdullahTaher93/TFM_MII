In a double boiler, dissolve the gelatin in the rum over simmering water. Remove from the heat and set aside. Whisk the egg yolks with ¼ cup sugar until lemony in color and the mixture falls in ribbons from the whisk. In a mixing bowl, combine the purée, the dissolved gelatin and rum, and the spices. Blend well and fold in the yolk mixture. Beat the egg whites in an electric mixer. When they begin to stiffen, gradually add the remaining ¼ cup sugar, continuing to beat until the whites form stiff glossy peaks. Fold the meringue into the purée mixture. Gently fold in the whipped cream. Do not overblend. Turn the mixture into the serving bowl and freeze for 10 minutes, or until set. Place the bowl in the refrigerator for 2 hours, or until thoroughly chilled. When ready to serve, sprinkle with the ginger julienne or decorate with additional whipped cream, piped in a lattice fashion and dusted with ginger. Serve with additional unsweetened whipped cream.
