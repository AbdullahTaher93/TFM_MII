Cream the butter or lard well and cream in the sugar very well (if using sweetened fruit, decrease the sugar by 1 or 2 tablespoons). Beat in the egg. Sift the flour with the other dry ingredients and add alternately with the fruit sauce. For a loaf cake use 1 cup sauce; for a sheet cake 1¼ cups. Turn into two 8 × 8 × 2-inch pans, an 11 × 14 × 2-inch sheet cake pan, or a 5 × 9 × 3-inch loaf pan. Grease the pan well or put greased paper in the bottom. Bake in a 350-degree oven about 35 minutes for layers, 45 minutes for a sheet cake, and 55 minutes for a loaf The cake is done if it springs back when pressed lightly in the center. Cool in the pan on a rack. Applesauce cake is not usually frosted, although some people like to frost it with browned butter frosting with nuts or serve it topped with ice cream or whipped cream. The cake is better after the first day, and keeps well.
