Warm the olive oil in a pan large enough to hold the broccoli di rapa over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the garlic is slightly colored, about 2 minutes. Add the broccoli di rapa, cover, and cook 3 to 7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the broccoli, removing the lid once or twice to stir. Transfer the broccoli di rapa to a large serving bowl.
