Wash and dry the cilantro. Roughly chop the cilantro and jalape√±os; then put them in a blender or food processor with the lime zest, juice, and garlic. Blend or process until well chopped, gradually adding the olive oil as you do so. Season with salt and add additional lime juice or vinegar to taste.
