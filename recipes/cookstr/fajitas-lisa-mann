Place the seeds in the water and allow them to soak overnight, or about 12 hours. Drain and rinse the seeds, then drain again. To make the tortillas, place the sunflower seeds in a food processor. Add the remaining ingredients and combine until smooth. Transfer the tortilla mixture to Teflex dehydrator sheets, making 4-inch round circles that are ¼-inch thick. (You should be able to make 4 to 6 circles.) Dehydrate at 105°F for 4 hours. (If you don’t own a dehydrator, see Notes on how to use an oven for this purpose.) After 4 hours, carefully flip the tortillas over and dehydrate for another 4 to 6 hours. (For directions on how to flip, see Notes.) When the tortillas are finished “cooking,” they will appear dry but will still be flexible. After you flip the tortillas, prepare the fajita filling. Combine all of the filling ingredients in a medium bowl, mix, then let marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Remove the vegetables from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Remove the tortillas from the dehydrator and fill with the marinated vegetables. Serve immediately.
