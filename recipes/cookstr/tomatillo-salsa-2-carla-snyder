Place chilies and tomatillos on baking sheet and set under the broiler until darkly roasted, even blackened in spots. Let cool. Attach the fruit/vegetable strainer to the mixer. Set to speed 4 and run roasted tomatillos and chilies, including all the juices, through the strainer into a large bowl, with another bowl to catch the solids. Discard solids. Place onion in a strainer and rinse under cold water. Shake to remove excess moisture. Stir onion, garlic, cilantro, water, lime juice and salt into the salsa. If too tart, season with a pinch of sugar.
