Remove the corn husks by cutting off both ends of the cobs, trying to keep the husks whole. Place the largest husks in a pot of hot water and set aside to soak. To make the stuffing, working over a bowl, run the point of a sharp knife down the center of each row of kernels to release the juices, and then scrape with the dull side to remove the kernels from the cob. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the grits with the paprika 1 to 2 minutes. Add the red pepper, the corn and its juices, the salt, white pepper, sugar to taste, and the cream and simmer until the mixture thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside to cool. Then stir in the baking powder and refrigerate. Drain the corn husks on paper towels. Make ties for the tamales by cutting a few of the husks into 10 to 12 strips. To stuff the tamales, overlap 2 or 3 husks on a counter and spread about 3 tablespoons of filling down the center. Fold over the sides and then the ends to enclose the filling. Tie with a corn husk string. Repeat with the remaining husks and filling. In a steamer or large pot fitted with a rack, make a bed for the tamales by lining the steamer rack with the remaining corn husks. Add the tamales and steam over low heat 1 hour. Remove from the steamer and let rest 10 minutes. Serve hot with the fresh salsa and sour cream. (Leftover tamales can be reheated in a steamer over simmering water for 20 to 30 minutes.) For the Salsa: Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl. Stir and toss well. Serve immediately, or store in a covered container in the refrigerator no longer than a day.
