For dressing, in a medium bowl combine oil, vinegar, green onion, marjoram, thyme, salt, and pepper. Place lamb chops in a resealable plastic bag set in a shallow dish. Pour about 1/4 cup of the dressing over chops. Cover and set aside remaining dressing. Seal bag; turn to coat chops. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Drain chops from marinade, discarding marinade. Meanwhile, cut each head radicchio through the core into 6 wedges; brush lightly with some of the remaining dressing. Thread tomatoes onto 4 wooden skewers. Thread radicchio wedges onto additional skewers, leaving a 1/4-inch space between pieces. For a charcoal or gas grill, place chops on a grill rack directly over medium heat. Cover and grill for 12 to 14 minutes for medium rare (145°F) and 15 to 17 minutes for medium (160°F), turning once halfway through grilling. Add radicchio and tomatoes to grill. Cover and grill for 2 to 3 minutes or until radicchio is slightly wilted and tomatoes are beginning to blister, turning once halfway through grilling. Divide greens among four plates. Remove radicchio and tomatoes from skewers. Place lamb chops, radicchio, and tomatoes on greens. Drizzle with remaining dressing; top with radishes.
