Heat the oil in a large deep frying pan over medium heat. Add the endives, shallot, thyme, and bay leaf. Cook, turning the endives occasionally, for about 3 minutes, until they are golden all over. Add 2 tbsp water and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer for 20â€“25 minutes, or until the endives are tender when pierced with a knife. Season with salt and pepper, then serve with the pan juices spooned over.
