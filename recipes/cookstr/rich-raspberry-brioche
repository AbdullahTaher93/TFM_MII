In a small bowl, mix the cheese with 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the lemon juice. Set aside. To assemble: Butter one side of each slice of bread with the butter, and sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar over the buttered bread. Place 4 slices on your work surface, buttered side down. Spread the cheese mixture evenly over the 4 slices. Carefully position the raspberries in neat rows over the cheese. Place the remaining 4 bread slices on top, buttered side up. Cut off the crusts (this helps pinch the bread together to create a tight seal). STOVETOP METHOD: Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Put the sandwiches in the skillet (in batches if necessary), cover, and cook for 2 minutes or until the undersides are golden brown and the cheese has begun to soften. Watch carefully, because the sugar burns fairly easily. Uncover, and turn the sandwiches, pressing each one lightly with a spatula to flatten them slightly. Cook for 1 minute or until the undersides are golden brown. Turn the sandwiches again, press lightly with the spatula, and cook for 30 seconds, or until the cheese is soft and creamy. Serve immediately. SANDWICH MAKER METHOD: Preheat a sandwich maker (if your sandwich maker has adjustable heat, set it to medium). Follow directions for sandwich assembly, and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions. GAS GRILL METHOD: Brush a grill rack with oil and preheat the grill to medium. Follow directions for sandwich assembly. Put the sandwiches on the grill and follow directions for the stovetop method.
