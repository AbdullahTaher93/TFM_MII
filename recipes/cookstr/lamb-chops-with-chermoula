To make the chermoula, combine the red onion, Â½ cup of the oil, 3 tbsp each of the mint and cilantro, the lemon zest and juice, the garlic, cumin, coriander, and paprika in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add the lamb chops and mix well to coat in the chermoula. Let stand 30 minutes. Mix the tomatoes, vinegar, remaining 2 tbsp oil, and 1 tbsp each mint and cilantro in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Preheat a broiler or build a hot fire in an outdoor grill. Remove the chops from the marinade. Broil or grill for about 5 minutes per side, until browned. Serve the lamb hot, with the tomato salad.
