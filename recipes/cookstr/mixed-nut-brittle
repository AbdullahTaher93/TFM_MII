Preheat the oven to 325Â°F Toast each type of nut separately by placing them in a single layer on a cookie sheet and baking until a little more than golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes for the cashews, 15 minutes for the pistachios, and 5 to 10 minutes for the almonds. As they are finished, let them cool to room temperature. Then gather them in a bowl and stir them together. Put 2 cups of the sugar in a saute pan and set it over medium-high heat. Let the sugar melt and caramelize until golden brown, approximately 4 minutes. Then add 4 tablespoons of the butter and whisk it with the sugar until it takes on an almost saucelike consistency. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in 2 cups of the nuts and stir until they are well coated in the caramel. Pour the mixture out onto a foil-lined baking sheet, spreading it out with a baking spatula. Repeat with the remaining sugar, butter, and nuts. Put the baking sheets in the oven and bake until the nuts spread out into a flat sheet, approximately 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Then break up by hand into desired-size pieces.
