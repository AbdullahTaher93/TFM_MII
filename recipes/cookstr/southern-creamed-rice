For the Basic White Rice: In a medium saucepot with a lid over high heat, combine the rice, water, and salt and bring to a boil; stir, reduce the heat to very low, cover, and simmer for 12 minutes. Lift the lid, stir the rice, replace the lid, turn off the heat, and place the covered pot in a skillet of warm water over low heat for 10 minutes to finish steaming the rice. Do not lift the lid until ready to serve. In a large skillet or casserole, layer the ingredients as they are listed beginning with the butter and ending with the cream. Cover the skillet and simmer the rice over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until most of the liquid is absorbed. Do not stir. Just before serving, stir the cheese into the rice and sprinkle with the chopped bacon, if desired.
