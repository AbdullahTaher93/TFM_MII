Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Cut the peaches in half (there’s no need to peel them) and remove the pits. Slice the peaches about ¼ inch thick and lay in a 9-inch deep dish pie pan. Sprinkle with the 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and drizzle with the Marsala, sherry or lemon juice. If the peaches are not very ripe and juicy (although they should be ripe enough to eat), pop them into the oven for 5 minutes to cook while you make the meringue. If they are very ripe and juicy there is no need to do this. To make the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a bowl with an electric beater until stiff. Still beating, gradually add the light brown sugar and continue to beat until the meringue holds stiff peaks. Spoon the meringue on top of the peaches and cook in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the meringue feels slightly firm in the center and is a deep golden color on top.
