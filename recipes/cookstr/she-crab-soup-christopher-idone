In a small saucepan, reduce the cream over moderate heat by one-third. In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Add the shallots and saut√© until wilted. Add the crabmeat and cook gently, tossing for 2 minutes. Pour in the reduced heavy cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Season with the nutmeg, cayenne, and lemon zest. Check the seasonings and add salt to taste. Mound some crabmeat in each warm soup plate and pour the soup around it. Sprinkle lightly with parsley. Serve the sherry at the table, adding a spoonful to each portion, if desired.
