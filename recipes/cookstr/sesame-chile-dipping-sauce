Whisk the sugar into the vinegar in a small bowl until dissolved. Working over the bowl, push the chile-bean paste through a fine mesh strainer to remove the rough solids. Collect any paste that has caught on the underside of the strainer and whisk it into the bowl. Whisk in the remaining ingredients. You may make this sauce in advance, but whisk again before serving.
