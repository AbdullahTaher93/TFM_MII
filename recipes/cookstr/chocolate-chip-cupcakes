Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line 2 muffin pans with 15 paper muffin liners. Combine all the ingredients through the vanilla in a bowl. Beat for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Stir in the chocolate chips. Divide among the muffin cups. Bake about 20 minutes. Cool completely. Boil the cream. Remove from the heat, add the chocolate, and stir and cool. Dip each cupcake top in the chocolate mixture to top.
