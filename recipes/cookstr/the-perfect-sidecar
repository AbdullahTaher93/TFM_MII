Chill 2 small stemmed cocktail glasses in the freezer. Spread the vanilla sugar on a small plate. Rub the rim of each glass with the reserved piece of lemon and dip it in the sugar. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice and add the lemon juice, Cointreau, and brandy. Shake well, then immediately strain into the prepared glasses. Drop in the cherries and serve immediately.
