Grind the lamb and onion, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Melt 3 tablespoons butter over low heat and add the flour to make a roux. Stir in the liquid and continue stirring till thickened. Season to taste. Combine with the meat. Spread into a 2-quart baking dish. Cool thoroughly. Peel the potatoes and cook in boiling water till tender. Drain, mash, and add 4 tablespoons butter, the milk, and seasonings. Let it cool slightly. When the meat is quite cold, spread the mashed potato over it to make a crust, or force it through a pastry bag, using a large rosette tube. Dot the crust with butter. Add crumbs or grated Parmesan cheese, if you like. Bake at 375 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until the crust is nicely brown and the dish is bubbling hot. A coleslaw would make a pleasant accompaniment to this dish. Although this is a delicious dish as it is, you may want to add some thyme or tarragon or a touch of garlic and tomato to the lamb. Or you may add chopped fresh herbs, such as chives, tarragon, and parsley, to the mashed potatoes.
