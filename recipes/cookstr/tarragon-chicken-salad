Preheat the oven to 350°F. Arrange the chicken breasts in a single layer in a large jellyroll pan. Spread evenly with the crème fraîche and bake until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. Shred the meat into bite-size pieces and transfer to a bowl. Whisk the sour cream and mayonnaise together in a small bowl and pour over the chicken mixture. Add the celery, walnuts, tarragon, and salt and pepper, and toss well. Refrigerate, covered, for at least 4 hours. Taste and correct the seasoning before serving.
