TO ASSEMBLE THE SANDWICHES: Set half of the bread slices buttered side down, and cover them with the cheese slices, folding them over if they extend past the edges of the bread. Place the top slice of bread over the cheese, buttered side up. Grill the sandwiches (see Note) and cut each in half on the diagonal. SUMMERTIME GRILLED CHEESE VARIATION When tomatoes are in season, my friend Jason Asch insists that I make his grilled cheese sandwich with the tomato slices layered inside before it’s grilled. Though I make this exception for him and for him only, I prefer the firm texture of the tomato when it’s slipped in after the sandwich is already grilled. 2–4 tomatoes, sliced ¼ inch thick, core end discarded 1–2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt, to taste Drizzle olive oil over the tomato slices and sprinkle with salt. Allow to sit for about five minutes. Assemble and grill the sandwiches according to the directions above. Cut each sandwich in half on the diagonal and slide in the tomatoes.
