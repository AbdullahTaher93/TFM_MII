Cut the chicken breasts in bite-size chunks (1 × 1-inch) or strips (1½ × 1½-inch) and set aside. In a small bowl, mix together the peanut sauce, soy sauce, coconut milk and sugar. In a medium saucepan, heat the sesame oil and sauté the garlic, ginger, green onions and green curry paste until garlic is fragrant. Add the chicken and chicken base; sauté until no pink remains. Add the peanut sauce mixture and stir to coat. Add the cornstarch mixture, whisking to avoid lumps. Heat to boiling and allow sauce to thicken, about 2 minutes. Add the red and green pepper chunks and the serrano chile. Remove from the heat and add the basil. Serve hot over rice. A family dinner winner! Variation: Pork tenderloin (1½ pounds) thinly sliced may be substituted for the chicken.
