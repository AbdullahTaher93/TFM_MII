Place the rice vermicelli in a large bowl and cover with room-temperature tap water. Let stand for about 1 hour, checking for tenderness occasionally. When the noodles are soft but still slightly firm to the bite, drain. (They should yield about 3 cups.) Meanwhile, for the broth: Combine the broth, ginger, scallion, and garlic in a large saucepan; heat to a boil. Cover and cook over low heat for 15 minutes. Set a strainer over a large bowl and strain the broth. Discard the solids. Pour the seasoned broth back into the saucepan. Add the shiitakes; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir the bok choy, shrimp, and drained noodles into the simmering broth. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and chile oil. Season to taste with salt. Ladle the soup into deep soup bowls, distributing the ingredients evenly. Sprinkle with the garnishes.
