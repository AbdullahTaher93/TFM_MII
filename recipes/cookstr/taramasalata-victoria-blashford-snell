Soak the bread crumbs with 3 tbsp water for 15 minutes. Split the roe down the center using a sharp knife and carefully peel away the skin. Process the roe, lemon juice, and soaked bread crumbs in a blender until well combined. With the blender running, very slowly add the oil in a thin steady stream until the mixture resembles smooth mayonnaise. Spoon into a small serving dish and mix in the onion. Cover and chill for at least 30 minutes. Serve sprinkled with paprika. Variation: For a lighter version, omit the bread crumbs and oil. Process the roe and lemon juice with 6 oz (175g) reduced-fat cream cheese.
