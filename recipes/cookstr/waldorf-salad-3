Core and quarter the apples (leave the skin on unless it is tough) and slice thin. Put in a bowl and toss with the lemon juice to coat. Add the celery and walnuts. Cover and chill. Mix the mayonnaise and honey (if you like a little sweetness in the dressing) together until smooth, add to the apple mixture, and toss. Serve on a bed of lettuce. Cranberry Waldorf Salad: Reduce mayonnaise to about ¼ cup and mix with ½ cup whole-berry cranberry sauce. Omit the honey. Add to the apple mixture and toss.
