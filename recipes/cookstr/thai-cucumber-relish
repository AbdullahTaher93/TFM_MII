In a dry frying pan over medium heat, toast separately the coriander seeds, peppercorns and cloves until fragrant; set aside. In a bowl, stir together cucumbers, onions, carrots and chilies; set aside. In a saucepan, combine toasted spices, 1/3 cup (75 ml) water, sugar, vinegar, fish sauce and salt; bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer and cook 10 minutes. Pour through a sieve over cucumber mixture. Stir in lime juice; let stand at room temperature at least 2 hours. The relish will keep a few days in the refrigerator. Serve garnished with coriander.
