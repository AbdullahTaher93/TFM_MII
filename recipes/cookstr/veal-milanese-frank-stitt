Spread the flour on a plate. Bear the eggs with the water in a shallow bowl. Put the bread crumbs on another shallow plate. Season the veal with salt and pepper. Dredge it in the flour, shaking off the excess, dip in the eggs to coat, and then transfer to the bread crumbs, turning to coat evenly. Place the meat on a sheet of wax paper or on a cooling rack. (The veal can be prepared to this point up to 1 hour ahead and refrigerated; bring to room temperature before cooking.) Heat the oil in a large heavy saut√© pan over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Working in batches, add the veal, without crowding, and cook until a golden crust forms on the first side, about 2 minutes. Regulate the heat as necessary to evenly brown. Turn and cook for 2 minutes more, or until golden. Transfer to a cooling rack and keep warm while you prepare the sauce. Add about a teaspoon of the butter and the shallot to the pan and soften over medium heat, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper, add the wine or vermouth, and increase the heat to high. When the wine has almost evaporated, whisk in the remaining butter bit by bit while shaking the pan. Add the lemon juice and chopped herbs, then taste and adjust the seasonings. Serve the veal with the sauce spooned over it.
