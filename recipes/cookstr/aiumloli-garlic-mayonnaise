Mash the garlic to a smooth paste in a mortar with a pinch of salt. Take out 1/3 of the paste and set aside. To the rest of the garlic add 1 teaspoon water, ¼ teaspoon salt, and the egg yolk, stirring well. Combine the two types of olive oil. Slowly whisk in the olive oil, a few drops at a time. As the mixture begins to thicken, begin adding the oil in a slow, steady stream. If the aïoli becomes too thick, thin it with a bit of water and continue. After all the oil has been mixed in, taste for salt and garlic and adjust accordingly. Refrigerate until needed. Aïoli should be used the day it is made, preferably within a few hours—the fresh garlic flavor dissipates and becomes unpleasant.
