Wash the tomatoes, split them in half lengthwise, pick out as many seeds as possible with the tip of a paring knife, and dice the tomatoes into Â¾-inch cubes. Wash the basil leaves, shake them thoroughly dry, and tear them by hand into tiny pieces. (For more pungent flavor, a few pinches of oregano can be substituted for the basil.) Grill the bread on both sides. While still hot from the grill, rub one side of each slice with the mashed garlic. Spread over it the tomato and basil (or oregano), sprinkle with salt and a grinding of pepper, and top with a trickle of olive oil. If the olive oil is truly choice, you can increase the amount. Serve at once.
