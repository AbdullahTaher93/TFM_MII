Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease eight 1-cup ramekins. Set aside. In a large bowl combine eggs, sugar, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, ground ginger, and salt. Stir in pumpkin and evaporated milk. Pour into the prepared ramekins. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until centers are set. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. Top with whipped cream and more cinnamon. Garnish with Crystallized Ginger. (see Notes)
