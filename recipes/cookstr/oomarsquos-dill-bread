1 1/2-quart ovenproof mold or loaf pan In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and set aside until foamy. In a bowl, combine the cottage cheese with the sugar, onion, salt, baking soda, butter, dill seed, dill flowers, and egg. Add the yeast and mix. Stir in the flour and knead to make a stiff dough. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set in a warm draft-free place until doubled, about 50 minutes. Punch down the dough and place in a well-oiled baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Brush the top of the bread with water and sprinkle liberally with kosher salt.
