Place the flour on a shallow plate or a pie plate. One piece at a time, dredge the chicken in the flour, coating both sides and shaking off any excess. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it foams, add as many pieces of the chicken, skin side down, as will fit in a single layer without crowding, and cook until deep golden brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes per side. As the chicken pieces are browned, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate. After all the chicken is browned, add the garlic to the skillet; brown it but do not let it burn. Transfer the garlic to a small plate. Add the onion and red pepper to the pan and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the onion and pepper to the slow cooker. Place the chicken on top, skin side up. Tuck the garlic in among the chicken pieces. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper; pour over the Grand Marnier. Cover and cook on HIGH until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 4Â½ to 5 hours. To serve, distribute the onion and pepper among the plates. Top with the chicken and sprinkle each serving with a few of the glazed walnuts.
