Boil the sherry in a small saucepan over a high heat until it is reduced to about 2 tbsp. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium-high, and add the chicken livers. Cook, stirring often, for 3â€“4 minutes, or until the livers are dark brown and crusty but still slightly pink on the inside. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish. Pour the reduced sherry on top, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve hot.
