Season the flour with salt and pepper and dredge the pieces of veal shank well. Heat the oil and butter together in a large casserole or Dutch oven over medium-low heat and sear the veal, browning well on all sides. Transfer the veal to paper towels to drain. Add the onions, garlic, basil, and oregano to the casserole and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste, and cook for another 10 minutes. Skim the excess fat. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Return the veal shanks to the casserole and add the beef stock just to cover. Cover the casserole and bake for 1½ hours. Remove the lid and bake, uncovered, until the veal is very tender, another 30 minutes. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and grated lemon zest and serve immediately.
