Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line 24 cupcake tins with baking papers. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Alternately add the flour mixture and buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour. Fill each baking cup two-thirds full. Bake until a skewer inserted into the middle of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
