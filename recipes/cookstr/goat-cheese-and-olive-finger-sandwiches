Remove pits from the olives if necessary and chop the olives. Put the olives, goat cheese, cream cheese, green onion, garlic and Tabasco sauce in a blender or food processor or use an electric mixer to blend. Use cookie cutter to cut out shapes in the bread. Do not use crusts. Cut out the bread shapes and spread the goat cheese/olive mixture on one side of bread. Top with another bread cutout. The filling should spill out the sides enough that chopped parsley will outline the shape when you dip them. Dip the edge of the sandwiches in the minced parsley. The olive mixture can be made ahead. Bring to room temperature before using. The bread can be cut out and stored overnight in an airtight container.
