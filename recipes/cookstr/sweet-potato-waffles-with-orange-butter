In a small bowl, whip together the butter, cura√ßao, and orange zest until the mixture is light and fluffy. Sift the first four ingredients into a large bowl, and set the bowl aside. In another bowl, combine the egg yolks, sweet potatoes, milk, sugar, and butter. Stir this mixture into the flour mixture. Beat the egg whites until stiff but moist peaks form, and fold the whites into the batter. Spoon the batter into a hot waffle iron, and bake until the waffles are golden brown and no steam appears.
