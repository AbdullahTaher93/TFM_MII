Saut√© the onion and green pepper in the butter and oil until just wilted. Add the chicken and mix well. Add the seasonings, herbs, and almonds, and toss. Press the chicken down well in the skillet, cover, and cook over medium heat for 2 or 3 minutes. When the chicken is heated through, pour in the beaten eggs mixed with the cheese and cook over low heat until set. If practicable, place under the broiler for 2 or 3 minutes to brown.
