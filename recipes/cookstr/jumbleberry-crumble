Put the flour and baking powder into a bowl and rub in the cubes of butter with your fingers until you have a mixture like coarse sand. This is such a small amount, it’s not really worth getting out the heavy machinery. Stir in the sugar and then put into a freezer bag to freeze. This mixture would make 4 jumbleberry crumbles in the cups, and about 8 ramekins. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Put the summer fruits in either a cup or a ramekin and sprinkle over the cornstarch and sugar. Stir around a little. Sprinkle over the frozen crumble topping and bake the cup for 20 minutes and the ramekin for 15 minutes.
