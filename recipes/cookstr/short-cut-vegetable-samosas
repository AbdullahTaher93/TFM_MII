Heat the oil on medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds. Add the ginger and mix well. Add the potatoes, cauliflower, and green peas and stir well. Stir in the salt, sugar, red cayenne pepper, and mango powder or lemon juice. Stir the mixture well. Cover and cook on low heat for 7 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. Coarsely mash the mixture with the back of a wooden spoon and stir in the chives and cilantro. Let the mixture cool. Cut the empanada wrappers in half and shape into cones (if using wonton wrappers, cut them in half diagonally and continue the process). Place about 3 teaspoons of the filling into a cone and press down to form a pyramid-like shape and carefully seal the edges. It is important to stuff until nice and plump and also to have well-sealed edges. Continue this process until all the samosas are assembled. Heat about 1Â½ cups of oil in a large skillet or wok. Gently deep fry about 2 or 3 of the samosas at a time for a couple of minutes. The samosas should be crisp and golden. The number of samosas fried at one time depends on the size of the wok, the key is not to overcrowd them. Drain them on paper towels and serve.
