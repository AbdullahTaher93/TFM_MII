Preheat the oven to 350°F. Tie a piece of butcher’s twine around each shank if your butcher has not already done so. Heat the oil in a sauté pan large enough to hold all 6 veal shank pieces. Season the veal with salt and pepper and dredge the cut sides (top and bottom) in flour, shaking off any excess. Place the shanks in the pan, in a single layer, pressing them firmly down so they make good contact with the pan. Once the shanks have browned, 8 to 10 minutes, turn them and brown the other side, pressing them down again. The second side should brown in 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the shanks to a Dutch oven or other heavy pot large enough to hold them in a single layer. You can also use a large roasting pan, and cover it tightly with foil. If they don’t quite fit in a single layer, rearrange them several times during the braising time. Leave 2 tablespoons fat in the sauté pan; discard the rest. Add the celery, carrot, onion, and garlic to the sauté pan and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the Marsala and white wine, stirring with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve all the brown bits. Add the thyme, parsley, bay leaf, orange and lemon peels, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, the stock, and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Once the mixture boils, pour over the shanks and cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil. Place in the oven and cook for 1 hour. After 1 hour, turn the shanks, cover again tightly, and continue to cook for about 1 hour more, until the meat begins to fall from the bone.
