Place the salad greens, figs, walnuts, and dressing in a bowl and toss. Divide among plates and crumble the blue cheese on top of each salad. Whisk together the shallot, vinegar, preserves, capers, and mustard in a small bowl. Whisk in the olive oil until the dressing is emulsified. Taste for balance, and add a little more olive oil, if you like. Season with salt and pepper.
