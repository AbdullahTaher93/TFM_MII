Prepare the tart dough recipe according to directions. Form dough into a ball, then cut into bits. Place half of the dough in the refrigerator and allow to rest for about 30 minutes; freeze the other half for another use. Quickly roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness or less. Using a cookie cutter, shape the dough into rounds to fit 6 (3½-inch) tartlet molds. Press each round into a mold and prick the bottoms and sides with the tines of a small fork or poultry needle. Set the shells on a baking pan, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes or longer. Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut out rounds of lightweight foil a little larger than the diameter of the shells. Lightly butter the shiny sides of the foil and place butter-side-down against the shells. Add a teaspoon of rice or small, uncooked beans. Place pan on center rack of oven and bake for 10 minutes, or until pastry is still soft and bubbles up. Remove the foil, prick the shells again, and continue to bake another 3 or 4 minutes until lightly golden. Allow to cool 10 minutes before unmolding onto a rack. Prepare the curd: Place the lemon juice, 1 cup cold water, and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. In a small bowl, dissolve the arrowroot in ½ cup cold water. Whisk in the yolks until the mixture is smooth and lemon colored. Slowly pour 1 cup of the lemon mixture in the yolk mixture and whisk thoroughly. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and bring to a simmer and whisk for 10 minutes or until thick. Remove the mixture and whisk in the butter bits. Scrape into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Puncture the plastic wrap in 2 or 3 places to allow the heat to escape. Cool completely. When ready to serve, whisk the curd lightly and spoon into the shells. Makes 6 individual shells.
