Combine the tomatillos, water, onions and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. When mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat to simmer until the tomatillos have burst, about one minute for small tomatillos and two to three minutes for larger ones. Strain mixture, reserving liquid. Transfer mixture to a blender together with the fresh cilantro. Puree, then add salt and pepper and one-quarter to one-half cup of the reserved liquid; puree fully. Allow to cool and then taste for seasoning, adding more liquid as needed.
