Sprinkle the fish with salt. Place a trivet in the pressure cooker and spread half of the dill sprigs and onion slices on it. Set the fish on top and cover with the remaining dill sprigs and onion slices. Pour in the wine and water, lock on the lid, and bring to pressure over high heat, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat right away and let sit for 5 minutes to finish cooking. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure. Transfer the fish to a serving platter, leaving behind the dill sprigs and onion slices and reserving the cooking liquid. Set the fish aside in a warm place and prepare the sauce. Heat the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted but not foaming. Whisk in the lime juice and cooking liquid, stirring until smooth. Swirl in the dill and olives. Use right away. Pour the sauce over the top and serve.
