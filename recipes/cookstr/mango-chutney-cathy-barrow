Combine all the ingredients in a large glass or ceramic bowl, stir, and cover. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Pour the mixture into the preserving pot and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Turn the heat down to a low, slow simmer and cook, uncovered, until the chutney is thick and jammy, about 40 minutes. Stir regularly but gently to keep the mango pieces intact, being careful not to let it burn or stick. Ladle into the warm jars, leaving a ½-inch headspace. Clean the rims of the jars well with a damp paper towel. Place the lids and rings on the jars and finger-tighten the rings. Process in a boiling-water bath for 15 minutes. The chutney is shelf stable for 1 year. WHAT TO DO WITH CHUTNEY If you have never made chutney, or are wondering what to do with chutney, please do try this version of mango chutney.
