Heat the oil in a pot on medium heat for 30 seconds. Add the cumin seeds and cook for about 30 seconds until they sizzle and become aromatic. Add the onion and cook for 7 to 8 minutes, until they soften and begin to turn golden. Add the cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and mushrooms and cook for another minute. Add the basmati rice and chickpeas and mix gently. Add 2Â¾ cups of water and the salt and cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep the rice covered and let it rest for about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes if desired. Fluff gently and garnish with cilantro and cashew nuts before serving.
