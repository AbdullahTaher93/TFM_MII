Cut the artichokes in half and put in a salad bowl. Add red pepper, onions, cucumber, olives, tomato, grapes and capers. Toss gently to mix. In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, salt and pepper until slightly emulsified. Drizzle over the salad and toss gently to dress all the pieces, but without breaking up the artichokes too much. Garnish with parsley, and serve within 1 hour (cover if it has to wait, but do not refrigerate).
