Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place the mushrooms, onion, and garlic in a nonstick roasting pan. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast the mushrooms until beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring to ensure even cooking. Add the livers and continue roasting until the mushrooms are well browned and flavorful and the liver is cooked but still pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes more. Purée the mushroom-and-liver mixture in a food processor, adding the parsley, brandy, and salt and pepper to taste. If the mixture seems watery, add a tablespoon or two of bread crumbs.
