To make the sauce, combine the cornstarch with just enough water to dissolve in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Whisk until completely dissolved. Add the coconut milk, peanut sauce, lime juice, and sugar, and whisk together until smooth. Set aside. Cook the noodles according to package directions until al dente, then drain and cut into shorter lengths. While the noodles are cooking, heat the oil in a soup pot. Add the onion and sauté over medium-low heat until translucent. Add the garlic and continue to sauté until both are golden. Layer the broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, bell pepper, and chilies in the pot without stirring them in. Pour in about 1 cup water. Bring to a rapid simmer (you’ll heat it rather than see it), then lower the heat. Cover and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until all the vegetables are tender-crisp. Add the sauce to the soup pot and stir everything together well. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 5 to 10 minutes longer, uncovered, or until the sauce has thickened and the vegetables are just a bit more done than tender-crisp. Place a small amount of noodles in the bottom of each serving bowl and ladle some of the stew over them. If you wish, garnish with chopped peanuts, sliced scallions, or both.
