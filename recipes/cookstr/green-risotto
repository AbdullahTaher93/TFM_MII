• 1. Saute the scallions in 1 tablespoon of the butter and the oil in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and garlic; cook over medium heat until the rice is opaque and pearl-like, about 3 minutes. • 2. Add the hot broth, ½ cup at a time, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and waiting until the broth is absorbed before adding more. • 3. While the risotto is cooking, blend together the basil, spinach, parsley, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a food processor. • 4. Continue adding broth ½ cup at a time to the risotto until the rice is cooked but still al dente, or firm to the bite. (All the broth may not be needed.) Stir in the herb butter, ¼ cup Parmesan, the salt, and pepper. Serve immediately. If desired, pass additional Parmesan at the table.
