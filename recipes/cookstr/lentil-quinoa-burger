In a saucepan, combine the quinoa and 2 cups (474 mL) of the water. Bring to a boil, cover, and lower the heat to medium. Cook for 15 minutes or until the quinoa is done. While the quinoa is cooking, combine all the sauce ingredients, except the lemon juice, in another saucepan. Heat the sauce for 5 minutes and transfer it to a blender. Blend until it is smooth, and season to taste with the lemon juice. Return to the pan and cook it over low heat for 5 minutes, or until it is warm. In a medium saucepan, bring the remaining 3 cups (711 mL) of water to a boil. Pour in the lentils and gently boil for 5 minutes. Remove them from the heat. Cover the lentils and let them stand for 4 to 8 minutes. Combine the quinoa and lentils in a food processor with half of the sauce and any spices you want to use. Pulse until the mixture is well combined, but not too wet. With your hands, shape the mixture into medium-sized patties. Place the patties in the refrigerator for a few minutes to let them set before cooking. On a greased griddle or skillet, cook each patty for 5 minutes per side. Cover the patties with the remaining sauce and enjoy!
