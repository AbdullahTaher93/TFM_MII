Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease 2 round 8-inch pans preferably non-stick. Stir the almond flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat the sugar and 8 tablespoons butter in the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer) on high speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and beat well after each addition. The batter should be light yellow and foamy. Add the zest and vanilla and almond extracts. Fold the dry ingredients into the batter with a rubber spatula one-third at a time. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely. Dust liberally with confectioners’ sugar before serving.
