Heat a small dry saut√© pan (preferably steel or cast-iron, not nonstick) over high heat. Add the whole tomatillos to the hot pan in a single layer, moving them around as needed to sear all sides. Small tomatillos will need three to five minutes, larger ones will take several minutes more. Remove and reserve. Add the garlic to the pan and sear; allow to blacken, turning as needed. Remove and reserve. Split the chilies and remove the seeds, stems and inner membranes. Quickly sear the peppers in the hot pan, just long enough for them to begin blistering but not burn, about ten seconds. Remove and reserve. Combine the tomatillos, garlic, chilies, chopped onion, salt and pepper and one-quarter cup water in a blender. Puree. Add another one-quarter cup water and continue blending until smooth. Taste for seasoning and add more water as needed. Allow to cool fully, then stir in the finely diced onion.
