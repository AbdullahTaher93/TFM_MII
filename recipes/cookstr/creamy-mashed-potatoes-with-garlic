In a large saucepan, combine potatoes, garlic, salt and enough cold water to just cover potatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until potatoes are very tender. Drain well and return potatoes to saucepan. Place over low heat to dry out potatoes slightly, shaking saucepan occasionally to prevent them from sticking. Mash potatoes and garlic roughly with a fork. Using an electric mixer, beat potatoes with milk, oil and pepper until smooth and very creamy. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, sprinkled with parsley. Variation: Substitute sweet potatoes for the white potatoes.
