Combine the water, vinegar, sugar, salt, cayenne and herb in a one-quart stainless steel or glass bowl. Place the sliced onions in a colander and run some very hot tap water over them for about 30 seconds. Shake off excess water and immediately transfer to the bowl with the vinegar mixture. Press the onions down a bit, although the liquid may not entirely cover them. Cover with plastic wrap and store in refrigerator for two hours, until they turn bright pink violet. They can be stored this way for two days; after that they become mushy. Drain well before using.
