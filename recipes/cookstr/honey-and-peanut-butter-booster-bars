Preheat the oven to 325Â°F: Grease and line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper. Put the butter, sugar, peanut butter, honey, and grated citrus zests in a deep saucepan over very low heat. Let heat until melted, stirring from time to time. Stir the oats, dried fruit, and three-quarters of the seeds into the melted butter mixture until thoroughly combined. Spread the mixture out evenly in the prepared pan, smoothing the top as you go. Scatter the remaining seeds over the surface and drizzle with a little more honey. Bake for about 30 minutes, until golden in the center and golden brown on the edges. Let cool completely in the pan (be patient - it cuts much better when cold), then turn out and cut into squares with a sharp knife. These bars will keep for 5 to 7 days in an airtight tin. Variation: Banana booster bars Replace the peanut butter with 1 medium ripe banana (about 6 ounces), mashed. Stir it in after all the other ingredients have been combined.
