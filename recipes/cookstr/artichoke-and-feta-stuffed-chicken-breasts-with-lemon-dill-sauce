Trim chicken and cut a pocket in the thick edge of each breast by holding knife parallel to breast and slicing to open up about 4 inches. Season the inside of the pocket with salt and pepper. Chop the artichoke hearts and combine with feta, 1 tablespoon chives, 1 teaspoon dill and 1 teaspoon lemon zest. Stuff Â¼ cup of filling into each chicken pocket, pinching edges to seal. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken and cook 3 to 4 minutes or until well browned on both sides. Remove chicken to a plate. Add the chicken broth to the skillet along with remaining dill and lemon zest. Stir cornstarch into lemon juice and add to sauce. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly to thicken. Return chicken to the skillet, with any accumulated juices, turning to coat in the sauce. Cover and cook for 7 to 9 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, turning over once. Serve chicken topped with sauce and sprinkled with remaining chives.
