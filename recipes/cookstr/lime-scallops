Mix the scallops, lime juice, oil, and seasonings together in a glass bowl and let marinate for at least 2 hours. When you’re ready to cook, thread the lime wedges and scallops on skewers—1 lime wedge, then 3 scallops, etc. Cook under the broiler or over a charcoal grill for 5 or 6 minutes, turning once. Serve the skewers sprinkled with the cilantro.
