Place the cider in a large, heavy pot and bring to a gentle boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and let simmer for about 2 hours. After about 2 hours, the cider will begin to thicken and coat the back of a spoon. This is the time to pay attention. Keep cooking over a gentle simmer, on very low heat, for another 45 minutes or until the jam begins to thicken and the syrupy mixture comes to about 190 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Our jelly usually takes almost 3 hours to thicken. Let cool and place in a glass jelly jar. Refrigerate. The jelly will keep for several weeks. Variations: Make a chile-spiced apple cider jelly: Wrap a chile pepper (that is cut in half, lengthwise) in a piece of cheesecloth and tie it up. Place the chile the cider for the first hour of cooking and then remove. Make a mulled apple cider jelly: Wrap 1 cinnamon stick, 1 allspice berry, and 3 cloves in a piece of cheesecloth and tie it up tightly. Place in the cider during the first hour of cooking, then remove. Make an herbal apple cider jelly: Add several fresh sage leaves or any fresh herb leaves during the first hour of cooking, then remove.
