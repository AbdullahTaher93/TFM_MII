For the crawfish: Fill a large stockpot one-third full of cold water. Add all of the ingredients except the crawfish and boil for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, soak the crawfish in salted cold water for about 15 minutes; rinse. Strain the stock and discard the vegetables. Place the crawfish in the liquid and add water to cover, if necessary. Bring to a rolling boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Drain and serve (see Notes). For the bisque: Break the cooked crawfish in half and remove the tail meat and fat. Reserve the shells and meat separately. In a stockpot, melt the butter and saut√© the onion and celery until wilted. Add the cayenne, heavy cream, and reserved crawfish shells, heads, and fat. Simmer over low heat for 45 minutes. In a food processor, blend the shells with the cream. Pass the soup through a fine sieve; discard the solids. Add the reserved tail meat and chill until ready to serve.
