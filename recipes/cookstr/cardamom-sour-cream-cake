Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease the sides of an 8-inch round cake pan and dust with flour; line the base of the pan with a disc of wax paper. Whisk the egg in a large bowl. Add all but 1 generous tablespoon of the sour cream or crème fraîche and the sugar and whisk to combine. Add the sifted flour and baking soda, then the salt and the ground cardamom. Fold the mixture to combine; do not overmix. Transfer into the pan and place in the oven. Cook for about 35 minutes, until the top of the cake just feels firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let it sit for 10 minutes before removing from the pan and cooling on a wire rack. When the cake has just cooled, make the icing by mixing the reserved tablespoon of sour cream or crème fraîche with the confectioners’ sugar. If it is too stiff add just a drop of water; if it is too runny, add a bit more sugar. Spread the icing over the top of the cake, allowing any extra icing to drip down the sides. Variation: Variation: Cardamom Sour-Cream Cupcakes This recipe works perfectly when cooked in a muffin pan. The cakes look so sweet with birthday candles in each one. Just divide the mixture between 12 muffin cups (use paper liners) and cook at the same temperature for 18-20 minutes. Ice as above.
