Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Scrub the squash, place them on a baking sheet, and prick each one in several places with a sharp knife. Bake until tender, about 1 hour. Remove the squash from the oven, cut them in half (use a towel to hold them), and scoop out the seeds. Season each cavity with salt and pepper, butter if you wish, a teaspoon of the sweetener of your choice, and a sprinkling of spice.
