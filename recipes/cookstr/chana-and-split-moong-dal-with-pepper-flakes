Put the split gram, green lentils, onion, ginger root, garlic, tomato, chiles, 1 tablespoon of the cumin, turmeric, salt, red chile powder, and water in the slow cooker. Cook on high for 5 hours. (See Notes for details on making this dish without a slow cooker.) Near the end of the cooking time, heat the oil in a shallow pan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of cumin. Once it is sizzling, add the red pepper flakes. Cook for another 30 seconds at the most. If you cook it too long, the flakes will get too hard. Add this mixture, along with the cilantro, to the lentils. Serve this alone as a soup or with brown or white basmati rice, toti, or naan.
