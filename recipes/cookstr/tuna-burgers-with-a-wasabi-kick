Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the egg white, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. With moistened hands, form the mixture into 6 patties, about 1 inch thick. Brush both sides of each burger with the oil and sprinkle the Greek seasoning equally over the burgers. Place the burgers on the grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side or to your desired degree of doneness. Serve on brioche rolls or buns with the wasabi sauce and pickled ginger.
