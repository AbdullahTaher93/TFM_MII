Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Sauté the garlic until soft but not burned. Add the shiitakes and cook until they give up their liquid, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the stock and Cinzano: Bring to a boil and boil until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. The sauce should just coat the mushrooms. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the fettuccine and bring back to a boil. Taste, and drain when it is slightly al dente but no longer crunchy, about 1 minute. Over high heat, toss the arugula into the shiitake sauce until it just wilts. Pour the sauce over the drained pasta and drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Serve hot.
