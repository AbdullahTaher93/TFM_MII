Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Roast the chicken bones on a baking sheet until browned, about 45 minutes to an hour. Toss the onions, carrots, and celery with the oil in a bowl. Spread the vegetables on another baking sheet and roast until browned, about 40 minutes. In a large pot over high heat, combine all the ingredients and add 6 quarts cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours, skimming occasionally to remove any foam from the surface. Strain the stock into a large bowl and discard the solids. Let the stock sit for 5 to 10 minutes so the fat floats to the surface, then skim off the fat, or refrigerate the stock overnight and remove the fat the next day.
