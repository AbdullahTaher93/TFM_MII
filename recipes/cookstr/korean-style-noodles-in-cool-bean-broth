Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Add the noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender but not mushy, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and rinse them under cold water then put them in a bowl or pot of cold water. Put the beans, nuts, sesame seeds, soy sauce, and a few grinds of black pepper in a blender with 3 cups of ice water. Purée until smooth, thinning with a little more water if the broth looks to thick. Taste and adjust the seasoning. (You can make the broth up to a day ahead; cover tightly and refrigerate.) Drain the udon noodles well and pile them up in the center of bowls. Ladle the cool broth all around. Garnish with cucumber and a few sesame seeds, a drizzle of sesame oil, and if you like, some chile and scallion; serve. 2.
