Rinse the fish and cut it into 4 or 6 portions. In a blender or food processor, whirl the oil, lemon or lime juice, chipotles in adobo to taste, garlic, if using, and 1 teaspoon of the salt, The more chipotle peppers, the less adobo sauce you need and the spicier your fish will be. Place the mixture in a shallow bowl. Add the fish and generously coat the fillets with the chipotle sauce. Put the cornmeal, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper into another shallow bowl or large plate. Dredge each piece of fish on all sides in the seasoned cornmeal. Unless you have a very large skillet, youâ€™ll probably have to pan-fry in two skillets or in batches. Fill a nonstick or well-seasoned skillet 1/4 inch deep with oil. Warm on medium-high heat until the oil is hot but not smoking. Cook the fish for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness, until the fish flakes with a fork. Transfer to paper towels to drain. If you have another batch to fry, keep the cooked fish in a warm oven.
