Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Season the fish all over with salt and pepper and place in an oiled baking dish. To make the salsa, combine all of the ingredients in a blender or food processor and puree. Pour the salsa over the fish and bake 8 to 12 minutes, until the thickest part of the fish is cooked through. Serve hot with lemon wedges and the salsa spooned on top.
