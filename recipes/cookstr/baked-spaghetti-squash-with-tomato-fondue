Bake the squash. Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Rub 1 tablespoon of the oil over the cut surfaces of the squash and then sprinkle with salt and pepper; place cut side down on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the squash until the skin is blistered and the flesh is softened--30 to 40 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and set aside until the squash is cool enough to handle. Prep the tomatoes for the fondue. Meanwhile, bring a medium-size pot of water to boiling over high heat. Drop the tomatoes into the water and cook for 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatoes to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Use a paring knife to peel the tomatoes; core each one and squeeze out the seeds. Chop the tomatoes. Make the fondue. Place the tomatoes, onions, and garlic in a medium saucepan. Stir in the juice, water, oil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes begin to form a soft pulp--for 20 minutes. Season the squash. With a table fork, "rake" the flesh out of the squash skin into a large bowl. In a saucepan large enough to hold the squash, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil with the garlic over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is aromatic--about 2 minutes. Add the squash to the pan and stir until coated with the oil and garlic. Stir in the scallions and 1/2 cup of the Tomato Fondue. Cook the squash mixture until heated through--6 to 8 minutes. Taste the squash and add more fondue, salt, or pepper if you wish (reserve the remaining fondue for another use). Serve immediately.
