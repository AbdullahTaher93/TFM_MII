Peel and coarse-chop the onion. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and saut√© the cumin, curry and chili powder, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon for 30 seconds on medium heat. Stir the chopped onions into the spiced oil and add half the salt. Press 2 cloves of garlic with the broad side of a knife to remove their skins. Add the cloves to the pot with the onions. Mix thoroughly and cook for 3 minutes. If you are using thin-skinned white potatoes, keep the skins on. If they have thick, brown skins (such as an Idaho potatoes) or red skins, peel them. Then cut the potatoes into 1" cubes, add them to the pot with the remainder of the salt, mixing thoroughly into the onion and spice mixture. As the potatoes and onions cook, discard the leaves from the cauliflower head and break off whole florets. Cut any florets in half that are larger than 1" around. Add the cauliflower and vegetable stock to the pot after the potatoes have cooked for 5-10 minutes, and cover with a lid. Stir occasionally. In 20-25 minutes or when the cauliflower can be pierced easily with a knife, chop and add the cilantro to the pot with the lemon juice. Stir again, now being careful not to break the softened cauliflower. Cook 5 minutes longer and serve. Serve with papadums (Indian wafers) and prepared coriander chutney.
