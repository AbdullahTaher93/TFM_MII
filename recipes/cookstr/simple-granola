Preheat the oven to 300Â°F. with the rack in the highest position. Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and spread on a cookie sheet or on a shallow roasting pan. (Do in 2 batches if your pan is too small.) Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, just until the mixture starts to smell good. Take care not to bum it. Cool completely. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator.
