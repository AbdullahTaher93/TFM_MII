Mash the goat cheese and sour cream together in a bowl with a rubber spatula until smooth. Add the parsley, sun-dried tomato, thyme, chives, garlic (if using), and season with nutmeg and black pepper and mix until well combined. Transfer to a serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator 1 hour before serving. Garnish the spread with chives and serve.
