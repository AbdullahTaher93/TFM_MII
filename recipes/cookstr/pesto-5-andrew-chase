In blender, on high speed, purée garlic, basil, oil, pine nuts and salt, scraping down sides as necessary. Pulse in cheese. Make ahead: Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Toss with fresh-cooked pasta (add 2 tbsp/25 mL softened butter and 1 to 2 tbsp/15 to 25 mL hot pasta water) or use as a versatile flavoring base. Makes enough for 1½ lbs (750 g) pasta, or 6 servings.
