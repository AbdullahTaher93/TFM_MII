Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Crust: In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, pulse flour, almond meal, sugar and salt until combined. Add butter and almond extract, pulsing until dough just comes together. Press dough into prepared pan, smoothing top. Bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes or until lightly golden brown and firm to the touch. Place pan on a rack and let cool completely. Filling: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine unsweetened chocolate and cream. Microwave, uncovered, on Medium (50%) for 1 minute, stirring every 30 seconds, or until smooth. In a small bowl, whisk together instant coffee and 2 tsp (10 mL) hot water. Whisk in liqueur. Add to chocolate mixture, whisking well. Whisk in confectioner’s sugar, butter and custard powder until smooth. Spread chocolate mixture evenly over cooled crust. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Topping: In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate and butter. Microwave, uncovered, on Medium (50%) for 1 minute, stirring every 30 seconds, or until chocolate is soft and almost melted. Stir until chocolate is melted and smooth. Spread over filling in pan. Refrigerate until chocolate is firm. Invert onto a cutting board to remove from pan and peel off parchment paper. Cut into bars.
