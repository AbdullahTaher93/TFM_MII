Place the cornmeal in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Pour in 2 cups of the milk; whisk constantly as you pour, so that the cornmeal does not form lumps. Whisk in the molasses, sugar, salt, baking soda, butter, and egg. Set the saucepan over medium-high heat and cook the mixture, whisking constantly and making sure to reach into the corners of the pan, until small bubbles start to form on the surface and the mixture starts to thicken. Remove from the heat and immediately add the remaining 2 cups of milk, whisking vigorously to dissolve any lumps. Pour the mixture into the insert of the slow cooker. Cover and cook on LOW for 9 hours, or until the outer edges and top have darkened and the middle is almost set. Turn off the slow cooker and let the pudding cool slightly, uncovered. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
