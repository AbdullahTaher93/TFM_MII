Crust: In a mixing bowl, cut the butter into the flour until it reaches the consistency of fine meal. Sprinkle on the sugar and add the egg yolks and ice water. Lightly blend together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap in waxed paper, and chill for at least 20 minutes. Filling: Preheat the oven to 350Â°. In a bowl, mix together all of the filling ingredients except the pecans. Blend well. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and fit it into the pie pan. Evenly coat the pastry with the pecan pieces. Pour the filing mixture over the nuts. Bake for 1 hour, or until golden brown. Cool to room temperature before serving with the whipped cream. Serves 8
