In a shallow casserole, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and saute the pork ribs until browned, sprinkling with salt and pepper as they cook. Stir in the broth and 1/3 cup water. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 1 hour (this can be done in advance). Meanwhile, cut the chicken into small serving pieces. Detach the wings and legs, hack off the bony ends of the legs, cut off and discard the wing tips, and divide each wing into 2 parts. With kitchen shears, divide the breast and each thigh into 4 pieces. Sprinkle with salt and let sit at room temperature. Remove the ribs to a warm platter and measure the broth to 1Â½ cups, adding water if there is less. Skim off the fat that rises to the surface. Reserve the ribs and broth and wipe out the casserole. Heat the remaining tablespoon oil in the casserole and brown the chicken and pancetta, turning once. Add the carrot, garlic, onion, and parsley and saute until the vegetables are softened. Add the reserved ribs and broth and the potatoes to the casserole. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 25 minutes. Stir in the peas, cumin, saffron, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and continue cooking for 15 minutes more. Serve.
