Be sure the heads, bones, and collars are clean, fresh (no fishy smell), and free of entrails. Wash thoroughly under running cold water. Melt the butter in a soup pot and gently cook the shallots, celery, and mushrooms without allowing them to brown until they are limp, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the wine and simmer for 5 minutes to reduce it a bit, then add the fish and seasonings to the pot. Add 14 cups cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer the stock, uncovered, for 45 minutes, stirring once or twice to redistribute the fish. Strain the stock, let it cool, and pour it into containers for storing or freezing.
