Soak the plank for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. First, prepare the salmon. In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, and celery seed. Rub liberally onto the flesh side of the salmon. Prepare the plank for grilling according to the instructions (see Notes). Place the salmon, skin side down, on the toasted side of the plank. Close the lid and grill for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the salmon is flaky around the edges but still opaque in the center. Once it has coole slightly, remove the skin, gently break the salmon into small chunks and set aside. Next, prepare the chowder. Heat the milk in a medium saucepan over low heat until it is nearly simmering; do not let it boil. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring often. Whisk in the heated milk until the mixture is smooth, then add the potatoes. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the salmon chunks and dill and simmer just until heated through, about 2 minutes.
