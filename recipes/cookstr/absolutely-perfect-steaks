Remove the steaks from the refrigerator 30 to 40 minutes before cooking. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Mix the oil and butter in a 9×13-inch baking dish. Put the steaks in this mixture, turning to coat each side. Lift the steaks from the pan and allow the excess oil to drip off. Place on a platter and coat each side of each steak with 1 teaspoon of the salt and 1 teaspoon of the pepper. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes. Place the steaks on the hottest part of your grill. Cut one burner to medium, but not the one where the steaks are. Be patient. Close the lid and cook the steaks for 3 minutes on one side, turn, and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Turn them back to the first side for an additional 3 minutes, and then finish the other side with an additional 3 minutes. Your total cooking time will be 12 minutes. This should give you a rare steak with a pretty decent char. If you desire a steak that’s cooked a little more, pull the steaks to the cooler burner. Remember that the meat will continue to cook after you’ve removed it from the grill. Allow the steaks to rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.
