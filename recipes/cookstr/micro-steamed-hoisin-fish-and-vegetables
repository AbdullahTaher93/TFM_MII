Cut the fish into 1-inch wide strips and place these in a 2-quart microwave-safe dish. Scatter the sugar snap peas, mushroom, ginger, carrots, and scallions evenly over the fish. Pour the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and vinegar into a small bowl and stir until well combined. Drizzle this mixture over the fish and vegetables. Cover the dish with plastic wrap, folding back on corner to allow the steam to escape. Place the dish in the microwave oven and cook on high power until the fish is cooked through and the vegetables are crisp-tender, 6 minutes. Stop every 2 minutes to gently stir and reposition the fish so that the outside pieces are moved to the inside. Spoon the fish and vegetables onto plates and serve.
