Beat the eggs until light and beat in the sugar gradually until the mixture is light and thick. Beat in the vanilla. Sift the flour with the salt and baking powder. In the meantime heat the milk just to scalding (when a slight scum begins to form) with the butter. Add the dry ingredients to the beaten eggs alternately with the hot milk. Stir just to mix. Turn into a greased 9-inch square baking pan and bake in a preheated 350-degree oven about 30 minutes or until the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. Serve iced or plain while still warm, or with fruit, chocolate or caramel sauce, or ice cream. The cake may also be eaten cold with whipped cream, icing, or fruit.
