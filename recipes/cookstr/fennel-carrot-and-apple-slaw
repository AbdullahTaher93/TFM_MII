Whisk the lemon juice, honey, sugar, salt, and hot sauce together in a small bowl until the honey dissolves. Add the oil in a steady stream, whisking as you go. Set the dressing aside. Remove 4 fronds from the fennel, chop them coarsely, and put them in a large bowl. Trim the fennel bulb, quarter it, slice it thinly, and add it to the bowl. Stir the dressing a couple of times to recombine and pour half of it onto the fennel. Toss well. Core and cut each apple into 1-inch dice. Add the apples and carrots to the fennel and toss. Stir the dressing again to recombine, then pour it into the slaw and toss well. Refrigerate the slaw for 30 minutes to let the flavors meld before serving.
