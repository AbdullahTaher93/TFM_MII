Place the sugar and 1 cup of the water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. When the sugar has dissolved, add the cranberries and return to a boil. Cook until the cranberries pop, about 4 minutes. Set aside to cool. Place in a blender and puree until smooth. Add the remaining ½ cups water, lime juice and lime zest to the blender and puree. Cover and refrigerate until the mixture reaches 40°F. Transfer to an ice cream maker and proceed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
