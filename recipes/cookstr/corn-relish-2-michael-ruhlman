Combine all the ingredients except of the cornstarch and water in a nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water, and stir into the relish to thicken it. Remove from heat. Cool, then cover and refrigerate.
