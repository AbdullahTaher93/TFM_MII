In a pot of boiling salted water, cook spaghetti for 8 minutes or until tender to the bite. Drain. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine bread crumbs, oregano, parsley and flour. Add meatballs and toss until evenly coated. Transfer to a plate, shaking off excess crumb mixture. Set aside. In a pot, heat tomato sauce over low heat until heated through. Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat for 30 seconds. Add meatballs and cook, turning, until lightly browned and crispy. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to tomato sauce. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until heated through. Divide hot spaghetti among plates. Spoon soyballs and sauce over top.
