If using cucumber spear, prepare by cutting a large cucumber in half, and then cut a wedge from cucumber half. Pare off peel in a single flap very close to flesh, peeling halfway up the wedge. Set aside. Fill a tall slender 12-ounce glass to the rim with ice cubes and then add vodka and Midori. Squeeze the wedge over drink and drip into glass. Add club soda to fill. Stir with a swizzle stick. Hang cucumber spear over edge of glass or garnish drink with mint. If desired, serve with tall, thin straws.
