Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly butter a 1-quart round baking dish. With a rubber spatula, mash the cream cheese, mayonnaise, salsa, and Worcestershire sauce in a medium bowl until combined. Stir in the crabmeat. Season with hot pepper sauce. Spread in the baking dish. (The dip can be prepared up to 8 hours ahead, covered tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerated.) Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the dip. Bake until the dip is bubbling, about 30 minutes or slightly longer if refrigerated. Serve hot.
