Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5â€“8 minutes until the onion is golden, but not browned. Stir in the tomatoes with their juice, tomato paste, and half the basil leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until the sauce is thick. Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Stir in the remaining basil. Variation: Spicy Tomato Sauce: Add 1 minced fresh hot red chile pepper with the tomatoes.
