At least 2½ hours before you plan to barbecue, or preferably the night before, mix the rub ingredients together in a small bowl. Cover the catfish lightly and evenly with the rub, reserving at least 1 to 2 tablespoons of the mixture if you plan to baste the fish. Place the fillets in a plastic bag and refrigerate them for 2 hours or overnight. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 180°F to 200°F. Remove the fillets from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. If you are going to use the mop (see Notes, “To Mop or Not”), mix the ingredients together in a small saucepan and warm over low heat. 5. Place the catfish in the smoker on a small grill rack as far from the fire as possible. Cook the fish for approximately 1½ hours, dabbing the catfish with the mop every 20 minutes in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for your style of smoker. When cooked, the catfish will be opaque and firm, yet flaky. Serve warm. If desired, accompany the catfish with Golden Mustard Barbecue Sauce.
