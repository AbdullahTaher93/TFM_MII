Peel and core the apples, cut into Â¾-inch cubes, and place in a large saucepan. Stir in the cider, cinnamon, and cinnamon stick. Bring the mixture to a gentle full boil over medium heat, stirring often. Do not cover. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until the apples are tender and saucy, about 30 minutes. Check and stir frequently, adding a little more cider if needed to prevent scorching and keep it saucy. Stir in both sugars, the salt, and lemon juice. Remove from the heat and discard the cinnamon stick. If the mixture is not saucy enough, stir vigorously until the right consistency is reached. Serve warm, cold (if serving with potato pancakes), or at room temperature. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Do not freeze this sauce.
