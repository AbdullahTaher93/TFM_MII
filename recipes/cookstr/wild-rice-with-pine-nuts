Place the rice, water, and salt in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the rice is tender, 45 to 55 minutes. Drain. In a medium sauté pan over medium heat, melt the butter (or heat the oil until shimmering) and sauté the pine nuts 1 minute. Add the leeks and scallions and sauté 1 minute, until softened slightly. Add the rice and heat through. Add stock, if needed, to moisten. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
