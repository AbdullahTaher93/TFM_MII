Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape each portion into a round. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. In the meantime, position a pizza stone or oven rack as low in the oven as possible. Preheat the oven to 475°. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons cornmeal in a 10-inch pizza pan, on a large baking sheet, or on a pizza peel if using a stone. Stretch the dough into a circle approximately 10 inches in diameter and no more than ¼ inch thick. Lay the dough on the prepared surface and repair any holes pinching the dough together. Lay 2 or 3 pieces of prosciutto on the pizza. Then spread about ½ cup of the radicchio evenly over the entire surface of dough, leaving ¼ inch of dough to form the edge of the pizza. Slice 1 piece of cheese into uniform slices and put on top of radicchio. Lightly brush the exposed crust with olive oil. Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake 15 to 18 minutes, until the edge of the pizza is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling. Repeat with the remaining 3 dough rounds. Serve them as they come out, or keep warm until ready to serve, You can also bake 2 at a time.
