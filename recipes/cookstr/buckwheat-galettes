To make the pancakes, sift the flours into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and add the eggs. Gradually mix the eggs into the flours using a wooden spoon, adding the milk and a scant ½ cup water to make a smooth batter. Cover and let stand for 2 hours. To make the filling, heat the oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the ham and thyme. Remove from the heat. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Heat an 8 in (20cm) nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Grease lightly with oil. Spoon in 2 tbsp of the batter and swirl to coat the base. Cook for about 1 minute, or until lightly browned underneath. Flip over and cook for 1 minute more, or until lightly browned on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter, re-greasing the pan as necessary. Make 8 pancakes in total. Stir the Brie and créme fraîche into the filling. Evenly divide among the pancakes then fold in the pancake edges to form "parcels." Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes until hot.
