Cut the finocchio tops where they meet the bulb and discard them. Detach and discard any of the bulb's outer parts that may be bruised or discolored. Slice off about 1/8 inch from the butt end. Cut the bulb vertically into slices somewhat less than Â½ inch thick. Wash the slices in several changes of cold water. Put the finocchio and the olive oil in a large saucepan, add just enough water to cover, and turn on the heat to medium. Do not put a lid on the pot. Cook, turning the slices over from time to time, until the finocchio becomes colored a glossy, pale gold and feels tender when prodded with a fork. Bear in mind that the butt end of the slice should be firm compared with the softer upper part of the slice. It should take between 25 and 40 minutes, depending on the freshness of the finocchio. If while cooking you find the liquid in the pan becoming insufficient, add up to 1/3 cup water. By the time the finocchio is done, all the water must be absorbed. Add salt, toss the slices once or twice, then transfer the contents of the pan to a warm platter and serve at once. Variation with Butter and Parmesan: Omit the olive oil in the ingredients list of the preceding recipe, and add 1/4 cup butter and 3 tablespoons freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese. Follow the cooking procedure described in the recipe above, substituting butter for the olive oil. When the finocchio is done, sprinkle with salt, add the grated Parmesan, toss three or four times, then serve at once.
