Prepare the Minted Lime Yogurt: Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl, and stir well. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours. Prepare the shrimp: Place the shrimp in a bowl, and add the olive oil, lime juice, chile powder, and salt and pepper. Toss, and let marinate for 15 minutes at room temperature. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the shrimp and sauté until they are pink and opaque, 2 minutes per side. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl and let them cool to room temperature. Then cut the shrimp in half crosswise (there will be 2 cups of shrimp). To assemble the tacos, place ¼ cup of the cooked shrimp in each taco shell. Top with a small handful of the shredded lettuce, followed by 2 tablespoons of the Farm Stand Corn Salsa. Dollop with a tablespoon of the Minted Lime Yogurt. Serve immediately, passing the extra Minted Lime Yogurt in a small bowl.
