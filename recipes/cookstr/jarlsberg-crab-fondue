Shred both cheeses coarsely or dice them into Â¼-inch pieces. Toss the shredded cheese lightly with the cornstarch until evenly coated. Pour the wine into a fondue pot and set over low heat until bubbles rise. Gradually add the cheese, a handful at a time, stirring each time until the cheese is completely melted. Avoid letting the mixture come to a boil. Stir in the sherry and crabmeat. Sprinkle with nutmeg and season to taste with salt and white pepper, if using. Serve with a basket of crusty bread cubes to dunk into the sauce.
