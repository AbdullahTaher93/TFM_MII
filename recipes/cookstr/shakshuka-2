Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and add the cumin seeds, shaking the pan every once in a while so they toast evenly. When the seeds are quite fragrant, about 1 minute, drizzle the oil into the pot, add the onions, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent and a bit caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Stir in the peppers, paprika, harissa, and the tomatoes with their juice. Increase the heat to medium, and bring the stew to a gentle simmer, cooking until the peppers soften and the juice starts to reduce, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat as necessary to keep the stew at a low simmer. Remove about half of the stew from the pot and puree in a blender or food processor until smooth. Add the puree back to the pot and cook for another 10 minutes. When the stew is nice and thick and luscious. itâ€™s time to cook the eggs. In the same pot (or divide the tomato mixture between 2 small pots), create four shallow indentations with a bit of room between them and drop 1 egg into each. Cover the pot and cook for another 4 minutes, or until the eggs are set the way you like them. Lighthouse serves this dish with a drizzle of tahini and grilled bread on the side to cut through some of the spice.
