Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 350Â°F. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, then whisk occasionally over the heat just until the mixture is bubbling and a very pale beige, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the milk and continue whisking over the heat until thickened, about 4 minutes. Drop the whisk and use a wooden spoon to stir in the Gruyere, ham, artichoke hearts, mustard, chutney, and tarragon. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the cooked ziti. Pour the contents of the pan into a 3-quart casserole dish, or even a 9-by-13-inch baking dish if you like more of the top exposed to the heat and many more crunchy bits as a result. 6. Sprinkle the Parrnigiano-Reggiano over the casserole and bake until brown and bubbling, about 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes before serving.
