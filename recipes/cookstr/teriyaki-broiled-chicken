Blend all the marinade ingredients well and pour over the broiler halves in a shallow dish or pan. Press the broiler halves into the marinade and turn several times while they marinate, which may be anywhere from an hour to 24 hours. Place the broilers a little farther from the heating unit than usual to prevent the soy sauce from caramelizing. Brush them with a little oil, and broil according to the basic rule for broiling (see Notes). Brush several times with the marinade. Spoon the pan juices over the chicken.
