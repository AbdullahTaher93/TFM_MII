Heat the stock in a saucepan. Add the tomatoes, tomato pur√©e, and onions, and simmer 1 hour. Remove the pan from the heat and whirl the mixture in a blender. Heat the butter in the saucepan, stir in the flour, and cook the roux for about 1 minute, without browning. Gradually stir in the blended soup. Add the wine and lemon juice, and heat the soup for 5 minutes. Remove the soup from the heat, and stir in the cream. Serve each bowl garnished with chopped fresh tomatoes and a sprig of fresh basil or dill.
