Preheat the oven to 200Â°F. Lightly oil a Pyrex or ceramic ovenproof dish wide enough to fit the fillets in one layer. Season the fillets lightly on both sides with salt and pepper and place in the dish. Place in the oven and bake, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes, depending on how well done you like your fish. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and let cool completely. Remove the foil and scatter the onion over the fish. In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and pepper to taste; the marinade should be well seasoned. Pour the marinade over the salmon and sprinkle with the dill. Cover the dish with wax paper, then foil, and refrigerate for 2 or 3 days without turning. To serve, bring the salmon to room temperature and serve along with some of the marinade and onions; garnish with freshly snipped dill.
