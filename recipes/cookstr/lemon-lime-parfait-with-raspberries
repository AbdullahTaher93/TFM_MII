To make the lemon-lime curd, combine the eggs, butter, sugar, lemon and lime zests, and lemon and lime juices in a heavy nonreactive saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thick enough to hold the mark of the whisk after you drag it through the curd, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour the curd through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl and let cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly against the curd, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Just before serving, whip the cream to soft peaks. Layer the curd, whipped cream, and raspberries in that order in four parfait glasses, repeating the layers two more times to make three layers of each.
