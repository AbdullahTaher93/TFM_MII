In an 8-inch saut√© pan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter or oil over medium heat. When it is heated, but not brown, add the garlic and shrimp, and cook, stirring, until the shrimp are pink. Stir in the chipotles and salt and remove from the heat. Preheat a heavy pan or griddle over medium heat and brush it lightly with some of the remaining butter or olive oil. Set a corn tortilla on the griddle and scatter 2 tablespoons of shredded Jack cheese evenly over the tortilla. Set 3 or 4 shrimp on one side of the tortilla. When the cheese starts to melt, fold the tortilla in half over the shrimp, and continue to cook on both sides until the cheese is melted and the tortilla is lightly crisped and golden brown. Open the taco. Dollop 1 teaspoon of chipotle salsa on top of the shrimp and follow with a tablespoon each of guacamole and mango habanero salsa. Tuck a couple of cilantro sprigs into the opening and serve right away. For the Chipotle Salsa: Stir together all the ingredients in a small bowl. The sauce keeps, refrigerated, for up to 1 week. If you plan to serve the sauce from a squeeze bottle, which can be convenient, puree the sauce in a blender and add 1 teaspoon water to thin it. For the Guacamole con Frutas: Split, pit, and mash the avocado flesh with the lime juice and salt, using a potato masher, fork, or a whisk in an up and down motion--never a blender of a food processor. Stir in the onion, serrano, and tomato. Place in a serving dish. Toss the mango with the tequila and lime juice. Arrange the mango, goat cheese, and pomegranate seeds in neat rows on top of the mashed avocado. Seta cilantro sprig on top and serve with fresh tostadas and limes. At the table, stir the ingredients into the guacamole and enjoy. For the Mango Habanero Salsa: Combine all the ingredients. Taste for seasoning; the salsa should be full-flavored, both sweet and very hot. You may need to add more lime juice or salt. This salsa should be used within 2 hours.
