Follow these steps: Place garlic on a cutting board; sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Chop until coarse, but consistent. Then, scrape with the flat side of knife to mash. Place the beef tenderloin medallions on paper towels on a plate. Pat dry on all sides. Rub the garlic mixture evenly on all 4 beef medallions. Replace the paper towels on the plate, and allow the beef medallions to quick-cure, uncovered, in the refrigerator, for about 30 minutes. Make the Sauce: Blend the aioli and the chiles. Chill. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the port wine to a boil. Now, reduce heat to a gentle simmer and reduce wine to a 1/2 cup of liquid. It should be syrupy. Remove from the heat, and stir in the lemon zest and smoked paprika. Pour the port reduction into a baking dish or shallow pan with a diameter small enough to allow the sauce to pool, yet hold all of the beef medallions. Set aside. Steam the Medallions: Ready a 10-inch stovetop steamer, filling the pot to a depth of 1 inch. I like using a bamboo steamer for this recipe. You'll only need one layer and the lid. Bring the water to a boil and get the steam going at a full (but not violent) rate. Place the medallions equidistant on a small square of parchment. Cover and steam for about 6 to 8 minutes or until desired degree of doneness. Remove the steaks from the steamer. Pat the tenderloin medallions dry with paper towels, and press them down into the port reduction. Allow them to "stain" for 5 minutes on each side. Plate Your Masterpiece: Transfer the medallions to a cutting board and slice at a broad angle. You should be able to get 4 reasonably thick (about 1/2-inch) slices per medallion. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the aioli mixture on each of 4 plates and smear, running across the plate with the back of your spoon. Snazzy. Fan the medallions over the aioli performance art. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the port reduction on the steaks to finish.
