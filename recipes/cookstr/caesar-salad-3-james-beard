Wash the romaine or lettuce thoroughly and dry well. Wrap in a tea towel or paper towels and refrigerate until ready to serve. Saut√© the diced bread in 4 tablespoons olive oil with the garlic cloves. Shake the pan well and cook over medium heat until the croutons are delicately browned and crisp. Add additional oil if necessary. Remove the garlic and drain the croutons on absorbent paper. In a chilled salad bowl, break the greens in bite-size pieces. Add the 8 tablespoons olive oil and toss well so that each leaf is coated. Add the croutons, salt, anchovies, pepper, and lemon juice. Break the egg into the bowl (there has been great discussion as to whether it should be a raw or a 1-minute coddled egg). Toss again and add the grated Parmesan cheese.
