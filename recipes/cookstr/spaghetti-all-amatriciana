Heat the oil and butter in a skillet and add the bacon. Cook, stirring, until bacon is rendered of its fat. Meanwhile, cut the onion in half and cut each half into the thinnest possible slices. Cook the onion, stirring, until wilted, about 10 minutes. Add the wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine evaporates. Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook 30 minutes. Add the basil and parsley and cook 10 minutes longer. Serve with spaghetti and Parmesan cheese.
