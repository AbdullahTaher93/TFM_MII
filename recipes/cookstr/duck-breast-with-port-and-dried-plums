Prepare a medium-high-heat fire, with the flames occasionally licking the grill grate. Let it burn steadily for 30 minutes. Place a large cast-iron skillet upon the grill grate and let it heat until very hot. Score the fatty skin of the duck in a Â¾-inch diamond pattern, taking care not to cut through to the flesh. Season the duck all over with salt and pepper. Transfer the duck, skin side down, to the hot skillet and cook until it is honey-brown and crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat into a heatproof container (reserve it for Duck Eggs with Rosemary Salted Potatoes). Turn the duck and adjust one's grill grate or tamp one's flames so that the fire provides medium heat. Cook to the desired doneness, 4 to 7 minutes (depending upon the size of the breast) for medium rare. Transfer the duck to a work surface, tent it with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Again pour off and reserve all but 2 tablespoons of the fat drippings. Return the skillet to the heat. Stir in the shallots and cook 30 seconds. Add the port, broth, plums, and vinegar. Simmer until the mixture thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the butter and fresh thyme; season to taste with salt and pepper.
