Line a 1 to 1Â½ quart pudding mold or bowl with the bread slices. Combine the fruit and sugar in a heavy saucepan, and simmer over low heat about 4 minutes to start juices flowing. Cool. Reserve some of the fruit juices. Pour the cooled fruit into the bread-lined mold and top with slices of bread. Cover with a plate or other flat object which will fit inside the mold, and weight it well. Let the pudding rest in the refrigerator overnight. To serve, unmold in a rather deep dish, and serve with the reserved juices, heavy cream, or whipped cream
