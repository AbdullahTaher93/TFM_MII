Preheat the oven to 450°F. Season the ribs with the garam masala and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place in a large roasting pan and roast for 45 minutes, or until the meat is browned, turning it once. Reduce the heat to 375°F. Add the garlic, shallots, carrots, celery, wine, 3 cups of the broth, tomatoes with juice, thyme, parsley, bay leaves, coriander, cloves, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Roast, uncovered, for 1½ hours, or until the meat is tender but not yet falling off the bone. Wash the turnips and, if they are larger than about 2 inches in diameter, cut them in half or into wedges. Add to the ribs. Spoon the sauce over the turnips and ribs. Add another 1 cup broth if the sauce is too thick. Roast for 1 hour, or until the turnips and meat are tender. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the ribs and turnips to a serving platter. Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs in the sauce. Working in batches if necessary, pour the sauce into a food processor or blender. Purée until smooth. Pour the sauce over the ribs and turnips and serve.
