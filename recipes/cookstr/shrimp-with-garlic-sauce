Place the garlic and oil in a bowl and set aside for at least 4 hours, stirring occasionally. When ready to prepare the dish, place the shrimp in a large bowl. Gradually add the salt to the bowl, tossing the shrimp to evenly coat them. Set aside for 10 minutes. Divide the oil and garlic between 2 large skillets over medium heat. Allow the garlic to cook until just golden at the edges. Stir half each of the paprika and cayenne into each skillet. Season with black pepper. Raise the heat to medium-high and divide the shrimp between the skillets. Stir the shrimp regularly, coating them with the oil, until theyâ€™re barely cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, quickly transfer the shrimp to heated serving dishes and spoon equal amounts of the garlic over and around each serving. Divide and sprinkle the parsley over each serving and then spoon in the remaining garlic oil. Sprinkle with additional salt if desired.
