Preheat the oven to 230ºC/495ºF/gas 8. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add your new potatoes and cook for 10 to 12 minutes until they are nearly done. Add all your beans to the pan and cook for another 4 minutes. Then drain the potatoes and beans in a colander. Put them into an appropriately sized roasting tray and add your peas, the butter, a little drizzle of olive oil and the zest and juice of the lemons. Season lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper and toss together while still warm so the flavours are absorbed. Chop up half the herbs and add to the tray. Score your salmon fillets lightly on the skin side. Rub each fillet with salt, freshly ground black pepper and a little olive oil, and stuff the scores with the remaining herbs. Put into the preheated oven and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes until the salmon is just cooked (don’t overcook it) and the veggies are soft. Serve at the table, giving everyone some veggies and potatoes, a nice piece of salmon steak and some of the lovely cooking juices from the bottom of the tray which are like a ready-made sauce. Great with some garlic mayonnaise.
