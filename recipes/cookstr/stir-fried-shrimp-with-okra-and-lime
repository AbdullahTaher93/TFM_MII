Place the shrimp in a bowl with the juice, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Toss to coat and let marinate for 5 minutes. Put the oil and butter in a non-stick skillet and turn the heat to high. When the butter foam subsides, add the shrimp and marinade and cook, stirring or tossing, until the shrimp is lightly browned, about 3 minutes (this will happen rapidly because the sugar will caramelize quickly). Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a plate, then return the pan to the stove. Add the okra and cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and crisped. If it looks like the okra is going to crowd the pan you’re working with, cook in batches. Add about 1/2 cup water to the pan and, over high heat, scrape to loosen any browned bits. Add the cilantro to the pan, stir everything together briefly, then transfer the okra and cilantro to a serving platter. Top with the sautéed shrimp and pour the pan sauce over all. Salt to taste, garnish with lime wedges, and serve immediately. 3. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a plate, then return the pan to the stove.
