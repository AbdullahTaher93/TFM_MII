Heat a panini or sandwich press according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Brush the mushrooms and onions with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place them on the press, pull the top down, and cook until softened and browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool slightly. Cut the rolls in half with a sharp serrated knife. Spread some chipotle ketchup on the bottom half of each roll. Place a mushroom on each bottom half. Top with a slice of grilled onion. Cover the onion with cheese. Top the sandwiches with the top halves of the rolls. Put the sandwiches on the press, pull the top down, and cook until they are browned and crisp and the cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes, depending on how hot your machine is. Carefully remove from the press and serve immediately.
