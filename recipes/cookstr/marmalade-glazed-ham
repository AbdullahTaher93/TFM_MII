Position the oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F. Combine the brown sugar, marmalade, mustard, vinegar, and cloves in a small microwave-safe mixing bowl. Stir well. Microwave, uncovered, on high power to melt the marmalade slightly, so the mixture will spread easily, 1 minute. Remove the glaze from the microwave and stir. Set aside. Line a roasting pan or a large casserole with aluminum foil and spray the foil with cooking oil spray. Cut the skin off the ham (it’s dark-colored and rough), if necessary. Trim away any excess fat. Place the ham on the foil, flat side down, and spoon some of the glaze over the ham to coat it. Rub the glaze into the ham with the back of a spoon to make sure all areas are covered. Place the ham in the oven and bake until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 140°F when inserted in the center (do not touch the bone), about 2 hours for an 8-pound ham (see Notes). While the ham is baking, baste it three more times with the remaining glaze. (Do not rub the glaze into the ham as you did the first time or you will rub off the glaze that has begun to bake on. Just spoon the glaze over the ham—it will spread easily over the hot ham.) If the ham begins to get too brown in the final minutes of baking, tent the top with foil. Remove the ham from the oven and let it stand for 15 minutes before slicing and serving. (If you expect to have leftover ham, slice only as much as you’ll serve at this meal. See Notes below for information on storing leftovers.
