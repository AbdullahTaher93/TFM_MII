Place squash on a baking sheet and bake 45 minutes until fork tender. Unwrap and serve with extra butter if you like. VARIATIONS Before wrapping add a little honey or maple syrup, brown, maple, or cinnamon sugar, or orange marmalade to squash along with butter, salt, and pepper (about 2 tablespoons in all will be enough).
