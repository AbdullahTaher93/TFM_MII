To make the white bean spread, heat the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, and cayenne pepper in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When the garlic just starts to brown, add the white beans. Cook, tossing or stirring, for 1 minute. Add the white wine and cook for another minute to reduce. Then add the broth and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and process until smooth. Set the white bean spread aside (it will thicken as it cools). Spread 2 tablespoons of the cooled white bean spread over 1 slice of toast; top with 3 lettuce leaves, 2 tomato slices, 3 onion slices, another slice of toast, another tablespoon of white bean spread, 3 or 4 slices of avocado, one-fourth of the chicken, 2 bacon strips (if using), and ½ cup of the sprouts. Top with a final slice of toast spread with 1 last tablespoon of white bean spread. Cut the sandwich diagonally into quarters; secure the quarters with wooden picks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 4 sandwiches. Variations: • Omit the rosemary from the white bean spread and add 4 or 5 chopped fresh basil leaves. • For a kick, stir some ancho or poblano chili paste, harissa, or salsa into the spread. • Substitute preserved tomatoes or pickled vegetables (zucchini, cucumber pickles, eggplant, mushrooms, or onions, for example) when the local fresh ones are out of season. • Use mesclun or arugula in place of the romaine, and omit the chicken and bacon to make a veggie decker sandwich.
