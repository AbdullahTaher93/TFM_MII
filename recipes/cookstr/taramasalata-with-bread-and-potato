Place the slices of bread in a bowl and add water to cover. Set aside to soak for a few minutes. When the bread is saturated, squeeze out the water. Place the potato in a small saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until cooked through, about 8 minutes. Drain the potato and set aside to dry for a few minutes, until cool enough to handle. Using a food processor, mixer, or mortar and pestle, blend together the bread, potato, roe, shallot, and lemon juice while gradually drizzling in the oil until thoroughly combined. Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and shape it into a loaf or mound. Sprinkle the cilantro over the top, and arrange the olives around the edges. Serve accompanied by the bread.
