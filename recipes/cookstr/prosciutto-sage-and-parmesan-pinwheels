On a lightly floured surface, unfold the puff pastry sheet and roll it into a rectangle measuring 11 by 14 inches. Spread the mustard evenly over the entire surface and arrange the prosciutto evenly on top of the mustard. Sprinkle the sage, Parmesan, and pepper evenly over the prosciutto. Roll up one side of the pastry toward the center, jelly roll style, stopping in the middle. Repeat this step on the other side so that the two rolls meet in the center. Carefully wrap the pastry in plastic wrap to help retain its shape. Refrigerate for 3 hours (or overnight) so the pastry has a chance to firm up. (If you’re in a rush, you can instead freeze the dough for about 30 minutes.) Preheat the oven to 400°F. With a serrated knife, slice the roll into ½-inch pieces and place them on a parchment-or Silpat-lined baking sheet, leaving a bit of space between the pieces so they have room to puff up as they bake. Bake the pinwheels for 15 to 17 minutes, or until they are golden and crisp. Serve warm or at room temperature with glasses of bubbly.
