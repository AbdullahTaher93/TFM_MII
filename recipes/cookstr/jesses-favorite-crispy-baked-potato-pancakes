FIRST Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Brush two baking sheets liberally with the olive oil, reserving a tablespoon. Using a hand grater, or the shredding disk of a food processor, grate the potatoes and transfer them to a large mixing bowl. Add the minced scallions, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix and add the egg and egg white, and the reserved tablespoon of oil, and stir to mix. SECOND Drop the batter by tablespoons onto the oiled cookie sheets. Press lightly to flatten and form circular pancakes, about 3 inches in diameter. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden brown on the bottom. Using a spatula or tongs, flip the pancakes over and flatten them. Bake another 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden brown. Let the pancakes cool slightly on a cooling rack, arrange on a serving platter, and serve with sour cream and/or applesauce on the side. To reheat, bake for 10 minutes in a preheated 350-degree oven.
