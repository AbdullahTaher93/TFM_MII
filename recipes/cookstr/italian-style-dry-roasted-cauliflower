Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Toss the cauliflower with the oil, cayenne, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Place in a shallow pan and bake, covered, for 45 minutes. Remove the cover and continue baking another 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove and serve hot or at room temperature, drizzled with lemon juice.
