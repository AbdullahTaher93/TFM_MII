Preheat the oven to 275°F (140°C). Place the artichoke hearts in a shallow baking dish with the tomatoes. Scatter the garlic cloves in the dish. Drizzle with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, add the thyme, if using, and season with salt and black pepper. Roast for 1 hour, until the garlic is very tender.
