Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 300°F. Lightly butter a 9-inch round cake pan. Line bottom with a lightly buttered parchment paper circle. In a double boiler melt the white chocolate over low heat. Remove the top of the boiler when the chocolate is nearly melted and stir until completely smooth. Set aside to cool. In a mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese at medium-high speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Transfer the cheese from the mixing bowl to another bowl and set aside. In the same mixing bowl using the paddle attachment, on medium-high speed beat the Brie until completely smooth and elastic, about 3 minutes, scraping the bowl often with a rubber spatula. With the machine on medium speed, add the cream cheese to the Brie in 3 parts. Blend the cheeses together until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Reduce speed to low and slowly add the sugar. At medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. On low speed, pour the melted white chocolate into the middle of the bowl. Mix until well blended, smooth, and creamy. Pour into the prepared pan. Place pan on a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet and place on the rack in the oven. Pour about ½ inch of simmering water into the baking sheet to form a bain-marie. Bake, uncovered, for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the top is lightly golden brown and puffed. The center should no longer jiggle when the pan is moved. Let cool in pan for 2 to 4 hours. To remove the cake, run a thin blade around the edges to loosen. Place a piece of parchment or waxed paper over the top of the cake and invert it onto a plate. Peel the parchment paper round from the bottom and turn the cake onto its serving plate. Remove the top parchment paper. Serve with seasonal berries or raspberry sauce. May be stored in the refrigerator for as long as 1 week.
