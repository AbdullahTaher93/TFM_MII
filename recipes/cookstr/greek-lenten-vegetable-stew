In a casserole, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium heat. When the butter stops sizzling, cook the onion until soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Add all the remaining ingredients, except the water and spinach, and toss so everything is coated with butter and oil. Add the water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Add the spinach, cover again, and once it wilts, after about 5 minutes, remove the pot from the burner. Serve hot or at room temperature with crusty bread.
