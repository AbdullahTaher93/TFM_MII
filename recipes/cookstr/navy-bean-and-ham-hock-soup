Place the beans, water, bay leaf, thyme, celery leaves, ham hock, ham shank, and clove-stuck onion halves in the pressure cooker. Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat about 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low to low and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes to finish cooking. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure and carefully remove the lid. Lift out and discard the bay leaf, thyme sprigs, and onion. Lift out the ham, cut the meat off the bone, and return the meat to the pot. Stir in the salt. Serve piping hot reheating if necessary, sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper and parsley, if using.
