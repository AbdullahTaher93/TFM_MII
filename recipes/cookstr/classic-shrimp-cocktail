Cook the shrimp by plunging them in about 3 quarts of boiling water and boiling for 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water. Peel the shrimp and, if you wish, devein them. Refrigerate for at least an hour or until well chilled. Combine the ketchup, chili sauce, horseradish, Tabasco, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl. Serve the sauce in small ramekins or cocktail glasses. Arrange the shrimp on the rim of cocktail stem glasses, if desired. Garnish with a lemon wedge.
