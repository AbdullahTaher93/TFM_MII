Place all the ingredients in a large pot or stockpot and cover with 3 to 4 quarts of cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 2 hours, or until a good vegetable flavor is achieved. Strain through a fine strainer, pushing down on the solids to extract all the liquid. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate or freeze.
