s Boil the potatoes in lightly salted water about 20 minutes, until tender. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Then place in a bowl and mash until smooth using a potato masher. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into the warm mashed potatoes, and mix well to make a pliable dough. Turn onto lightly floured work surface and knead briefly until smooth. Pat the dough into a 7in (18cm) square. Cut the dough into quarters, then cut each in half diagonally to make 8 triangles. Brush a griddle pan lightly with oil and heat until hot. Add the scones and cook, turning halfway through, about 4 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or warm. Variation: Savory Potato Scones: Add finely chopped fried onion, dried mixed herbs, or even curry powder to the mashed potato dough before rolling out.
