Preheat panini grill to high. Sprinkle tomato slices evenly with salt and pepper; set aside. Place rolls, cut side down, on a work surface and brush crusts with oil. Turn rolls over and spread with mayonnaise. On bottom halves, evenly layer with shrimp, cheese, bacon, avocado and seasoned tomato. Cover with top halves and press gently to pack. Place sandwiches in grill, close the top plate and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately. Variation: Try using freshly baked, thickly sliced sourdough bread â€” what a treat!
