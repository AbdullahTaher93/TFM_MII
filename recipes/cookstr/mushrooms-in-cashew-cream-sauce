Make the Cashew Cream: Put the cashews in a powerful blender, such as a Vitamix. Add the water and blend on the highest speed until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy. If itâ€™s still too thick, add a little more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Use it as a base for a nondairy alfredo sauce, or drizzle over steamed veggies. Make the Mushrooms: Mix together the Cashew Cream, water, and salt. Set aside. In a deep, heavy pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the green and black cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cassia leaves. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until aromatic. Add the onion and garlic. Cook until brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for 6 minutes, until they soften, stirring occasionally to avoid sticking. Make a well in the middle of the mixture. Add the Cashew Cream mixture and heat through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the whole spices. Add the red chile powder and garnish with the fresh cilantro or parsley. Serve immediately with brown or white basmati rice.
