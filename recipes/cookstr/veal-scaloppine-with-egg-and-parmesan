Whisk the eggs together for 1 minute until light. Stir in the anchovies, Parmesan, parsley, and Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Place the arugula in the bottom of four shallow serving dishes and dress with the olive oil and some black pepper. To cook the veal, set two large frying pans over high heat and add the vegetable oil. Turn the scaloppine in the flour until evenly coated, and then dip in the cheesy egg mixture. Place two scaloppine in each of the pans and cook for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until golden on the underside, about 2 minutes longer. Turn and cook on the other side for 2-3 minutes. Add half of the butter to each frying pan. When it has melted, pour half of the vinegar into each, tilting the pans to combine the juices. Lift out the scaloppine and lay them on the arugula. Drizzle the buttery pan juices over the veal and serve with lemon wedges.
