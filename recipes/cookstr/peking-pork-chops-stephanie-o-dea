Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Put the chops into the stoneware. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, spices, soy sauce, ketchup, and garlic. Pour evenly over the top of chops. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or on high for about 4 hours. Serve with rice and veggies and ladle the sauce on top. These chops freeze and reheat wellâ€”yay!
