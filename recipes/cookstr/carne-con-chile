Heat the oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven and brown the meat well, 5 to 10 minutes, until any water evaporates. Add the onion and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, flour, cumin, bay leaves, black pepper, and salt. Stir constantly for about 2 minutes or until the flour is browned. Add 2 cups water and the ancho pods. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring, and adding more water until the ancho dissolves completely and the meat is tender. Remove any large pieces of ancho skin. Serve in a bowl with tortilla chips or as a sauce over enchiladas or tamales.
