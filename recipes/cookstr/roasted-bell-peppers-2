Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 13-by-9 inch (3 L) baking dish. Place peppers in prepared baking dish. Brush both sides of each pepper piece with garlic oil and sprinkle with garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until very soft and wrinkled. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a plate and let cool to room temperature. The skins will naturally separate from the flesh of the pepper (see Notes). Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 days. Variations: Balsamic Marinated Peppers: Cut peeled roasted peppers into quarters. Add 1/2 cup (125 mL) balsamic vinegar and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or for up to 1 week. Garlic Marinated Peppers: Toss peeled roasted peppers with 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced, and 1/4 cup (50 mL) extra-virgin olive oil. Marinate for several hours or overnight, then remove the garlic. Add sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste and serve immediately.
