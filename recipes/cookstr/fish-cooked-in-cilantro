Have the fish cleaned, leaving the head and tail on. Prick the fish well on both sides with a coarse-tined fork, and rub it with the salt and pepper. Place the fish onto a baking dish with half the onions underneath and the rest on top. Pour the lime juice over it and set it aside for about 1 hour, turning it over once during that time. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Cover the dish and bake the fish for about 15 minutes on each side. Add the rest of the ingredients and continue cooking the fish, covered, until it is just cooked, basting it from time to time with the juices in the dish-about 20 minutes.
