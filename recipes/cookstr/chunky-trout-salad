About 2 hours before you plan to smoke the trout, combine the dressing ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth. Place the trout, lying open, in a shallow, nonreactive dish. Drizzle each fish with about 1 tablespoon of the dressing. Cover the trout and refrigerate about 1½ hours. Prepare your smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200°F to 220°F. Remove the trout from the refrigerator and let them sit covered at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the fish to the smoker, skin side down. Cook the trout until opaque and easily flaked, about 35 to 45 minutes. When the fish is cool enough to handle, break it into uniform chunks or chill it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour if you wish to serve it cold. Toss the greens with enough dressing to coat the leaves lightly. Arrange the greens evenly among four plates. Place equal portions of the trout over the greens. Top the salad with a scattering of apples, grapes, pecans, shallots, and pepper, drizzle with any remaining dressing, and serve.
