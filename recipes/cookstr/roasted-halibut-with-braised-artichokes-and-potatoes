Preheat the oven to 500°F. In a saucepan, combine the potatoes with water to cover, add some salt, and bring to a boil. Cook until nearly tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain well. Season the fish generously on both sides with salt and pepper. In a bowl, combine the potatoes, artichokes, ¼ cup olive oil, garlic, rosemary, and wine and toss to mix evenly. Turn into an oval gratin dish or other baking dish just large enough to hold the mixture and the fish. Measure the fish fillet at its thickest point. Nestle the fish, skin side up, in the vegetable mixture, and drizzle with a little olive oil. Roast until the fish is opaque when tested with a fork and the skin is browned, about 7 to 9 minutes per inch of thickness. Remove from the oven and liftoff and discard the skin from the fish. Pick out and discard the rosemary. Scatter the olives around the fish and serve directly from the dish, or transfer the fish and vegetables to a warmed platter and scatter the olives around the fish. Serve with lemon wedges on the side and olive oil for drizzling.
