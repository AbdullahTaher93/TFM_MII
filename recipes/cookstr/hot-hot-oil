Mix oil and caribe, pequín, or chiles in a small, heavy saucepan. Warm until oil almost begins to bubble, and then reduce heat; caribe, pequín, or chiles should not turn black. (If you do not have a good source of low, controlled heat and a heavy saucepan, heat oil first, and then add 1 bit of caribe, pequín, or chile. If it floats and keeps its redness, add the rest. Cover and watch carefully, stirring occasionally.) Cook over low heat until caribe, pequín, or chiles darken but do not turn black. Cool overnight at room temperature, and then strain oil through cheesecloth. Store tightly covered in the refrigerator. Let warm to room temperature to serve.
