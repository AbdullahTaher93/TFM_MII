Place 1 or 2 canned lychees in a chilled cocktail glass. Pour vodka and syrup into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake briskly, then strain into the glass. FOR YOUR FURTHER DRINKING PLEASURE: Use ginger-infused vodka (see page 128), or add a pinch of powdered or freshly grated ginger, for a Lychee Ginger Martini. Some people also like to add a few drops of grenadine to give this cocktail the ruby glow of fresh lychees. We have also encountered a lovely drink called the Lotus Flower, which is made like the Lychee Martini but uses orange vodka and, in addition to the lychee syrup, adds 2 tsp. pink grapefruit juice, a dash of orange bitters, and 2 dashes of sweet and sour mix.
