Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a medium-size skillet (not a cast-iron skillet, because it will cause the okra to discolor) over medium heat. Add the okra and cook, stirring frequently, for about 30 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook until the okra is no longer ropey or slimy and is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat for 2 minutes and add the flour. Cook, stirring slowly and constantly, to make a dark brown roux (see Eula Mae’s advice on making a roux). Add the yellow onions, 1 cup of the green onions, the garlic, bell peppers, celery, and 1 tablespoon of the parsley and, cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are tender and lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, ham, okra, shrimp stock, bay leaves, thyme, Worcestershire, Tabasco, and salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes. Add the shrimp and crabmeat and simmer until the shrimp turn pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme. Garnish with the remaining ¼ cup green onions and 1 tablespoon parsley. Serve the gumbo over rice and pass additional Tabasco at the table.
