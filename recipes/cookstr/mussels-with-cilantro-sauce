Brush the mussels very well under cold running water; drain well. In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Add 2 teaspoons garlic and the mussels and cook for 30 seconds. Add the red wine and ½ cup water, cover, and cook for 1 minute, or until the mussels are all open (discard the ones that stay closed). Remove the mussels with a slotted spoon. Remove the top half of each shell, leaving the mussels intact on the bottom half of the shell. Arrange the mussels on a serving platter. Heat a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining ¼ cup vegetable oil and the remaining 1 teaspoon garlic and cook until the garlic becomes fragrant. Turn off the heat and stir in the oyster sauce and chopped cilantro, mixing well. Spoon the sauce over the cooked mussels and serve.
