Pull back the corn husks and remove the corn silks. Place the corn in a plastic bag or shallow dish large enough to submerge both the ears and the husks. Pour the beer and Worcestershire sauce over the corn, and soak it for 1 to 2 hours, turning it occasionally if needed to marinate evenly. In a small saucepan, warm all the butter ingredients together over low heat for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat but keep the mixture warm. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. Drain the corn. Brush each ear generously with the seasoned butter. Rearrange the husks in their original position. Tear one or two husks into strips and use them to tie around the tops of the ears to hold the other husks in place. Transfer the corn to the smoker and cook it until tender, about 55 to 65 minutes at a temperature of 225° F to 250° F. Remove the corn from the smoker and pull the husks back to make “handles” for the ears, or pull the husks off and discard them. Serve the corn hot, accompanied with a small bowl of the remaining butter, melted or at room temperature.
