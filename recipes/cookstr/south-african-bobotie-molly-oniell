Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a flat bowl, soak the bread in the warm milk. In a nonreactive heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until the onion is translucent, 5 minutes. Add the curry and coriander and cook until the spices no longer smell raw, 5 minutes more. Add the lamb and sauté, breaking up the lamb with a large spoon, until cooked or warmed through. Remove the skillet from the heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bread from milk and gently squeeze out any excess milk. Add the bread, jam, salt, vinegar, egg, raisins, and almonds to the meat mixture and blend well. The consistency should be the same as for a meat loaf. Oil a 3-quart baking dish or soufflé dish. Add the meat mixture and smooth the surface, gently pressing the mixture into place with your fingertips. Make the custard: Beat the eggs, lemon zest, and ginger with the milk. Strain through a sieve onto the meat. Garnish with nutmeg. Bake until the custard is set, 30 to 45 minutes.
