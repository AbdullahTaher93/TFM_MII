In a pan large enough to take all the ingredients, melt the butter and sweat your leeks, onion, and garlic, avoiding any browning. When these are giving, add the potato and cook with the leek mixture for 8 minutes, again avoiding browning. Then add the stock and bring to a gentle boil. When the potato is cooked, season with salt and pepper. Now puree the soup in a blender and return it to a clean pan on the heat. Just before eating add the oyster liquor to the soup and place two oysters in each soup bowl. Pour the hot soup over the oysters and eat.
