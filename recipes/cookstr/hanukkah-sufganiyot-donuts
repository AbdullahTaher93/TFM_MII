In mixer bowl, sprinkle yeast over milk and stir with a fork. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Attach bowl to mixer fitted with paddle attachment and add eggs, oil, 1 cup (250 mL) of the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt to yeast mixture. Let stand in bowl for 10 minutes. On low speed, mix just until blended, then gradually add just enough of the remaining flour until dough starts to pull away from sides of bowl. Increase speed to medium and beat for 1 minute. Transfer dough to a large oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Divide dough into 18 equal pieces. Roll dough into round balls between the palms of your hands. If dough is tacky, dust with additional flour. Place at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on prepared baking sheet. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large, deep pot or deep fryer, heat about 4 inches (10 cm) oil over medium heat until temperature registers 360°F (182°C). Deep-fry 4 donuts at a time in hot oil, turning once with wooden chopsticks, until golden brown, about 15 seconds per side. Using a slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to absorb excess oil. Fry remaining donuts, adjusting heat as necessary between batches to maintain oil temperature. Let donuts cool completely and then fill with Raspberry Filling, using a Bismarck tip or pastry bag. If desired, ice with glaze and/or dust with confectioner’s sugar. Finishing suggestions Icing: Simple Sugar Glaze Topping: Dust with confectioner’s (icing) sugar
