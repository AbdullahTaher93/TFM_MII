Preheat the oven to 350°. Butter and flour the kuglehopf mold; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugars. One at a time, add the eggs and mix well. Beat in the vanilla. Sift together the dry ingredients and spices. Alternately add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk to the butter and egg mixture. Pour the batter into the mold and bake for 1 hour or until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto a serving plate and unmold. For the Stewed Quince: Peel, core, and roughly chop the quince. Place the fruit in a small non-aluminum saucepan and toss with the lemon juice, sugar and ¼ cup water. Add the cinnamon, place over low heat and cover. Simmer, stirring from time to time, until the fruit begins to give off juice and soften. Serve warm with the cake.
