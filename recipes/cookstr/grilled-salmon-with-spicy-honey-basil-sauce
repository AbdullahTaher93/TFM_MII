To prepare sauce, place pine nuts, honey, lemon juice, olive oil, basil, garlic, and chile in a blender or food processor. Process until mixture is pureed. Spoon sauce over salmon, and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight or for at least 4 hours, turning twice. Place bell peppers and watercress in a bowl. Toss with vinegar and olive oil. Cover and refrigerate while salmon cooks. Oil grill rack and preheat grill to medium-high. Remove salmon from sauce, reserving the sauce. Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper on both sides. Place salmon on grill rack and grill until opaque throughout, 4-6 minutes on each side. Occasionally brush with reserved sauce. Garnish salmon with bell pepper and watercress mixture and serve with brown rice.
