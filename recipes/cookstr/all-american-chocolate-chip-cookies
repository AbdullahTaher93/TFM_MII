An all-time classic favorite with kids of all ages. I personally like my cookies with big pieces of walnuts or pecans, but I've made them an optional ingredient, so it's up to you to decide. Use really good chips such as ghiradelli--they do make a difference. You can also use chocolate chunks for really chocolatey cookies. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 cookie sheets with nonstick silicone liners or parchment paper. Set aside. Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together and set aside. Place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until smooth. Add the sugar and vanilla and beat for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture is light and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well to incorporate after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl to include every bit of the ingredients. Add the flour mixture, beating to blend well. Fold the chocolate chips and nuts, if using, into the dough. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie onto the prepared cookie sheets, taking care not to crowd them since the cookies will expand. Place them in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until they are golden brown and set in the middle. Using a spatula, lift the cookies onto wire racks to cool for about 10 minutes. You can store them, tightly covered, for up to 3 days.
