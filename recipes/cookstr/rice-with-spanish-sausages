Place the chorizo in a cold 4- to 5-quart heavy pot and set the pot over medium heat. When the chorizo has rendered some of its fat and is sizzling, stir in the sofrito. Cook until the water has evaporated and the sofrito begins to sizzle. Stir in the alcaparrado, cumin, and salt. Cook 1 or 2 minutes, then stir in the rice. When the rice is chalky, pour in enough broth to cover by the width of two fingers. Bring to a boil and cook until the level of liquid meets the rice. Add the culantro leaves and give the rice a big stir. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Cook until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir the rice and serve.
