Preheat oven to 400°F. Place fillets in a lightly sprayed or oiled 8-by-10-inch glass baking dish. Season generously with salt and pepper. In a medium skillet over medium heat, warm oil. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce, oregano, and basil and simmer 1 to 2 minutes. Pour sauce over the fish and sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, until fish flakes when tested with a fork, about 20 minutes.
