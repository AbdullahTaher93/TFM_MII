Place the salt and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan over high heat (the liquid will be oversaturated, and the salt will eventually precipitate). Add the lemons, skin side down, and simmer for 30 minutes. Drain the lemons; rinse once, place in a container covered with the lemon juice, and allow to cool.
