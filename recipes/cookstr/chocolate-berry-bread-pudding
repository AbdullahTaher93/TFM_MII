Prepare the chocolate bread: Early in the day or the day before serving, preheat the oven to 350°F. Heavily butter a 9 x 3-inch loaf pan. Melt the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat. Set aside to cool. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside. Beat the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla, then the cooled chocolate mixture. With a wooden spoon, stir in half of the flour mixture. Stir in the sour cream, then the remaining flour. Continue stirring until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the loaf comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool the bread for 10 minutes, then remove it to a rack and let cool completely. Prepare the berries by combining them in a medium bowl, then tossing them with the cassis. Set aside. Prepare the custard: Whisk the eggs, sugar, and flour together in a medium bowl. Add the cream in a thin, steady stream, whisking constantly, until well blended and smooth. Assemble the pudding: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 1½-quart soufflé dish and sprinkle with sugar. Slice the chocolate bread into half-inch-thick slices and lay them out flat on a baking sheet. Toast the bread in the oven for 15 minutes, then turn and toast the other side 10 minutes more. Set aside to cool. Do not turn off the oven. Place one-third of the toasted bread slices in the soufflé dish. Top with half the berries; spoon one-third of the custard over the berries. Use half the remaining bread to make a second bread layer. Top with the remaining berries and half the custard. Make a final layer with the remaining bread and top it with the remaining custard. . Bake the bread pudding in the oven until the custard has set and the top is lightly browned, 1½ hours. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.
