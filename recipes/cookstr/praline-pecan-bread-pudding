Line a 4-quart slow cooker with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, whisk together the condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, and cinnamon. Add the bread cubes and pecans and stir gently. Pour the mixture into the slow cooker. Cover the slow cooker and bake on low for 2 to 3 hours, or until the pudding is set. Spoon the warm bread pudding into individual serving bowls.
