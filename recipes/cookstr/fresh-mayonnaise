In a blender or the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, process the yolks for about 1 minute. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil in a very fine stream until the mayonnaise begins to emulsify. As it thickens, add a few drops of water to loosen the texture, up to 2 tablespoons if necessary. Add the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mayonnaise to a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. Refrigerate for up to 1 week.
