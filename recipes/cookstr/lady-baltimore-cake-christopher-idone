Cake Layers: Preheat the oven to 350°. Butter three 9-inch round cake pans. Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Sift together the dry ingredients and gradually incorporate them. Slowly add the milk and rum. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with a dash of salt until stiff and glossy. Fold the whites into the batter. Divide the batter evenly among the cake pans. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan. Unmold the cake layers and let cool completely on a wire rack. Filling: In a small bowl, soak the dates and raisins in the ¼ cup rum for several hours, reserve. Frosting: In a heavy saucepan, bring the sugar, corn syrup, and 1 ½ cups water to a boil and cook until it reaches a temperature of 232°, or until the syrup threads 8 inches off the edge of the spoon without dripping. In a bowl, beat the egg whites with a dash of salt until stiff and glossy. Gradually beat in the hot syrup. Drain the dates and raisins, reserving the rum. Combine the fruits and chopped nuts with one-third of the frosting to making the filling. Assembly: Combine 1 cup of Simple Syrup with 1/3 cup white rum and reserved rum. Trim the tops and bottoms of the cakes. Brush the bottom layer with some of the rum syrup. Spread half of the filling over the bottom layer. Place the second layer on top of the first. Brush it with syrup and spread with the remaining filling. Set the top layer in place and brush with a little of the syrup. Frost the sides and top of the cake, using small circular motions to create swirling peaks.
