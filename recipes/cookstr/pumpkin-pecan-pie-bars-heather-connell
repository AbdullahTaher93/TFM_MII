Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C, or gas mark 4). Line an 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20 cm) baking dish with parchment paper, making sure the paper goes up the sides. To make the crust: In a small bowl, combine the almond flour, hazelnut flour, maple syrup, coconut oil, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, baking soda, and salt. Using a fork, stir together until a crust forms. Press the crust mixture into the prepared baking dish, forming an even layer across the bottom of the pan. Bake the crust for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden. Allow the crust to cool completely. To make the filling: In the bowl of food processer or high-speed blender, place the pumpkin puree, eggs, dates, coconut milk, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice. Process until smooth and the dates are broken up. Pour the filling into the cooled crust. To make the topping: In a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, pecans, coconut, maple syrup, date, coconut oil, and cinnamon. Mix well, then evenly sprinkle across the filling. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the filling is set. Allow the bars to cool completely before removing from the pan, using the parchment paper overhang. Cut into sixteen 2-inch (5 cm) squares. Store the bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, Before enjoying, allow the bars to come to room temperature.
