Prepare coals for grilling, allowing at least 30 minutes for the coals to become properly hot. Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and allow them to come to room temperature. Trim any excess fat, pat dry, and coat lightly with olive oil. Place the steaks over the coals. Cook to sear one side, 2 minutes. Turn and season the cooked side with salt and pepper. Sear the second side for 3 minutes. Turn, season the second side with salt and pepper, and continue cooking until the steak is well-erusted and is medium-rare, about 3 minutes more. (A Tuscan never would cook Fiorentina to medium, but if you must, lengthen the final stage to 4 or 5 minutes.) Transfer the steaks to large plates or platters, garnish with lemon wedges, and serve at once.
