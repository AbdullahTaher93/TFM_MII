Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. Snap off ends of beans. Core radicchio and finely slice. Blanch beans in water until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain well and reserve pan. Return pan to medium heat and add butter. When melted, stir in radicchio and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lettuce is lightly wilted, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in beans. Cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are very tender, about 2 minutes. Season with lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.
