To make the peaches: Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C). In a medium bowl, stir together the peaches, brown sugar, ginger, and oil. Arrange the peaches on a baking sheet and roast until they are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow them to cool completely. To make the crust: In a medium bowl, combine the pecans, graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, and butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan. To make the compote: In a small saucepan, combine two-thirds of the blueberries with the sugar and 1/3 cup (75 ml) water. Simmer over medium heat until the berries burst, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining third of the blueberries and cook for 8 minutes more, until the compote coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely. To make the whipped cream and assemble: Spread half of the ice cream into the prepared crust, then layer on the cooled blueberry compote. Top the compote with the remaining ice cream and smooth the surface. Place in the freezer for 1 hour. In a chilled bowl, combine the cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Using a chilled whisk, whip by hand or with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Top the cake with the peaches, blueberries, and whipped cream.
