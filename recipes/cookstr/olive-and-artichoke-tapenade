Place the garlic and anchovy in a bowl and mash with the back of a spoon to make a paste, adding a little of the oil if necessary. Place the garlic paste, remainder of the oil, olives, artichokes, tomatoes, walnuts, green peppercorns, lemon juice, and zest in a blender or food processor and pulse to make a chunky paste. Combine the paste with the black pepper and cheese in a bowl and stir to mix. Allow the tapenade to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to blend the flavors. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Add the parsley, put in a bowl, and serve with the crostini on the side.
