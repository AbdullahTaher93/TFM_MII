Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onions or leeks and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until very soft. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to boil for the pasta. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, add the asparagus, and cook for 1 minute. Add the carrots, if using, and cook for 1 minute. Add the sweet peas and cook for about 30 seconds. Add the snap peas, if using, cook for about 30 seconds, then drain. Add the asparagus and other vegetables to the onions, then stir in the cream. Set the pan aside while you cook the pasta. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain and transfer to the pan with the onions. Place the pan over high heat and cook, tossing, for 1 to 2 minutes, until the vegetables are hot. Add the mint, chives, ½ cup of the cheese, the lemon zest, and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and toss well to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Serve in warm bowls, garnished with more mint and the remaining grated cheese.
