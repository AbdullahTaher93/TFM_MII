In a medium-size skillet, heat the oil and butter together until the butter melts. Stir to blend the mixture well over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the crumbs absorb all of the oil-and-butter mixture and are golden brown. Season with the salt and remove the crumbs to a bowl to cool. When cool, transfer the crumbs to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. They will keep for several weeks.
