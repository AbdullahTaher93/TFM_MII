In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat the oil over moderately low heat. Sauté the yellow peppers just until they wilt. emove and reserve. Sauté the red pepper strips in the same manner and reserve. Sauté the onions and garlic until the onions wilt. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the herbs and fish stock and bring the mixture to a slow simmer. Add the fish and shellfish in the order listed. As each fish takes on color, add the next one. Add the clams last. (Unlike East Coast clams, they require little cooking to open.) Quickly fold in the peppers. Transfer the stew to a heated tureen and stir in the fennel leaves.
