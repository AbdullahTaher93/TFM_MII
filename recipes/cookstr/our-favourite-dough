Pre Dough In a small bowl, add the yeast to the water, and stir to dissolve. Add the flour to the yeast mixture and stir. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for at least 2 hours, preferably as long as 4-5 hours. The mixture should form bubbles on its surface. Main Dough In a small bowl, add the yeast to the water, and stir to dissolve. Place the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the yeast mixture and the Pre-Dough to the flour mixture. Run the mixer on its lowest setting until the dough is shiny and smooth (about 15 minutes). If the dough feels a bit dry or hard just add a bit more water (a tablespoon at a time). Pour the dough into another bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 24 hours, or up to 48 hours. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Punch it down to remove air. Divide the dough into 5 or more pieces, depending on how many pizzas you are making. (A 12-inch [30-cm] pizza uses about 9 ounces [260 g] of dough.) Form each piece into a ball and place them on a tray. Cover any dough you are not using right away and store it in the refrigerator for later use, or freeze. Give the dough you are using enough time to reach room temperature. This can take up to 2 hours. Place the dough pieces on a tray and cover with a thin layer of flour. Cover the tray with plastic wrap and let the dough rise to double its original size. It is now ready to use.
