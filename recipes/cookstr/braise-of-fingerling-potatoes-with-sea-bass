Heat a heavy-bottomed saucepan (measuring 10 1/2 inches in diameter by 6 1/4 inches deep) over medium heat. Add the olive oil and heat for 3 minutes, then add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 minutes or until they start to break down but have not started to color. Add the potato and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the tomato and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until it starts to break down. At this point, season with salt and pepper, increase the heat to high, add 2 2/3 cups of council pop (as my grandfather used to say, that is water) and bring to a boil. Turn down to low heat and cook out for 15-20 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked. Now add the sea bass, turn up the heat to high and cook for 4 minutes. Take the pan immediately off the heat, stir in the capers, cover with a lid and set aside for 10-15 minutes. Take the lid off and have a look to see if the fish is cooked. If it's ready, check the seasoning and put back over medium to gently heat. Add the lemon juice and parsley and serve. If you can't get sea bass, give cod or maco shark a try.
