Stir the cornmeal, flour, baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt together in a bowl. Whisk the eggs in another bowl, then whisk the eggs, milk, and butter into the dry ingredients to make a batter. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Pour a thin layer of vegetable oil into a large saute pan and heat it over medium heat until a drop of batter sizzles on contact. Begin to spoon batter, 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time, into the pan to make pancake-like corn cakes, cooking them until lightly crisped and golden on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Cook in batches, cleaning the pan if it becomes messy and adding additional oil as necessary. Keep the cakes warm by covering with foil while you finish cooking the remaining batter. In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and chopped chives. Arrange the corn cakes on a serving dish or platter; top each with a dollop of the cream, and finish with some of the sliced salmon. Garnish with whole chives and serve.
