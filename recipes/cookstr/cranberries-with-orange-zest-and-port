Wash and drain the cranberries, and pick them over carefully, removing any spoiled berries or foreign objects. Pour the port into a large nonreactive skillet, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the cranberries, and cook, stirring constantly, until they begin to pop, about 5 minutes. When the cranberries are popping, pour the sugar, salt, and orange zest over them. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar melts and the mixture begins to simmer briskly, 3â€“5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool before serving.
