In a large saucepan, combine all ingredients except salt. Over high heat, bring to a boil, then reduce to low, cover and let simmer for two and a half to three hours, stirring regularly and checking the water level. Add half the salt just as beans are beginning to soften. Cook until tender. Pour off excess water if needed. Taste and add more salt as needed.
