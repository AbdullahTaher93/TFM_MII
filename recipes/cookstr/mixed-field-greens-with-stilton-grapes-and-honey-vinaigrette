Preheat the oven to 350°F. For the salad, toast the almonds on a baking sheet for 3 to 4 minutes in the oven. Wash the lettuce and tear into bite-size pieces. If preparing ahead, wrap the washed lettuce in paper towels and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. To make the honey vinaigrette, put the first 4 ingredients in a blender or food processor. Process the vinaigrette until smooth. Slowly add oil in a thin stream through the top hole while the blender or processor is running. Continue processing. The mixture will thicken slightly. Shortly before you are ready to serve, halve the grapes and core the apple. Cut unpeeled apple into wedges and dice (¼-inch pieces). Toss desired amount of dressing with salad greens, grapes, apples, cheese and almonds. Dressing may be made ahead and stored in refrigerator.
