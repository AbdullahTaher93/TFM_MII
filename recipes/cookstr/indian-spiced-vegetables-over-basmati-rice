Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and cook until the onion is soft and lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Add the carrots, cabbage, chickpeas, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric, salt, and cayenne. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened. Add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the coconut milk and heat through. Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary. Serve over the hot cooked rice.
