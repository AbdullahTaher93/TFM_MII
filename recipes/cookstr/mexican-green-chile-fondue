In a fondue pot over medium heat, heat the milk until bubbles form. Toss the cheeses lightly with cornstarch until evenly coated. Gradually add the cheeses to the pot, a handful at a time, stirring each time until the cheeses are completely melted. Stir in the coriander, cumin, chiles, and hot pepper seasoning, if using, and keep warm over low heat. Serve with shrimp, vegetables, and apples for dipping. Pass a basket of tortilla chips.
