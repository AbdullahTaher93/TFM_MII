Heat the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the coriander and cumin and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the flour. Then replace the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring, 2 more minutes. Gradually pour in the milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Then add the mushrooms, give them a stir, and simmer very gently for 5 minutes. Stir often while the mushrooms cook, scraping the bottom and into the corners of the pan to keep the sauce from burning. Stir in the garam masala and continue to cook at a bare simmer until the mushrooms are tender but still have some bite, 3 to 5 more minutes. Stir in the white pepper and taste for salt. Serve hot.
