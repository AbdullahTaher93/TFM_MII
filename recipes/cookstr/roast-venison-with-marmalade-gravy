Mix the marinade ingredients in a large, nonmetallic bowl. Add the venison and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 24–72 hours. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Remove the venison from the marinade and pat dry. Brush with the vegetable oil. Place in a roasting pan and let stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Strain and reserve the marinade. Roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Mix the ½ cup reserved marinade and the marmalade and spoon some over the venison. Continue roasting, basting occasionally with the marmalade mixture, about 20–30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the roast reads 130°F (55°C) for medium-rare. Transfer the venison to a carving board and tent with aluminum foil. Let stand for 10-15 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, skim any excess fat from the pan juices. Stir in the reserved marinade. Bring to a boil and cook about 5 minutes, until slightly reduced. Pour into a sauceboat. Carve the venison and serve with the sauce.
