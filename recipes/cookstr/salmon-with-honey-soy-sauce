Preheat oven to 350°F. In a small bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce and mustard and set aside. Melt a tablespoon butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add the salmon fillets, skin side down. Cook the salmon 4 minutes per side. Remove the skin. (Skin should remove easily.) Transfer the cooked salmon to an ovenproof platter or baking dish and place in a 150°F oven while you make the sauce. Melt remaining butter and add the mushrooms and garlic. Sauté to soften mushrooms. Add the wine to the hot skillet and deglaze the pan scraping all the bits with a spatula. Add the honey mixture to the skillet and boil for 1 minute. Stir the green onions into the sauce just before serving and pour over the cooked salmon.
