Peel oranges and lemons so none of the bitter white under-skin is left. Slice into rounds, Â¼ inch (6 mm) thick. Arrange oranges, lemons, and onions alternately on a platter. Drizzle oil over fruit to glaze, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with mint or basil. Let stand 4 hours, covered at room temperature, so juices can mingle. Serve at room temperature.
