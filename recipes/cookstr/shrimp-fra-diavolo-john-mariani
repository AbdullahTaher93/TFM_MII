In a medium-size saucepan, heat the olive oil over low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes, oregano, salt and pepper to taste, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add the shrimp, increase the heat to medium, and cook until the shrimp are done, 3 to 5 minutes. Adjust the seasonings and serve at once.
