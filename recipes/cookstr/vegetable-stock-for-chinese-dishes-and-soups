Rinse the mushrooms quickly in cold water. Wash and scrub the carrots, leaving 4 inches of their tops on, if possible. Combine the mushrooms, carrots, scallions, lettuce, salt, and 5 cups water in a 4-quart pot and bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat and simmer for half an hour. Strain the stock through three layers of cheesecloth. Discard all the vegetables except the mushrooms. Boil down the stock to 4 cups. Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar. Mix and check seasonings.
