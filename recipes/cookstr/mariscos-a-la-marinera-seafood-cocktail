If you are using clams, open them or have them opened for you, saving both the clams and their juice. If you are using scallops, let them marinate in the lime juice for an hour or so. Combine the clams (and their liquid) or other seafood with the rest of the ingredients, adjust the seasoning, and serve slightly chilled (see note above).
