Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Make the sauce: In a bowl, whisk together the tomato puree and clam juice. Stir in the parsley, oregano, anchovy paste, capers, red wine vinegar, chilies, olives, and tomato. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Divide the sauce in half. Refrigerate one-half for use on pasta in the next day or two. Heat the other half in a skillet over moderate heat, then adjust the heat to keep the sauce hot without simmering. Season the swordfish with salt and pepper. Heat a large oven-proof skillet over high heat. When hot, add the olive oil. Add the swordfish, reduce the heat slightly, and cook on one side until nicely seared, about 2 minutes. Turn the steaks and transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake until the fish is done throughout (test with a fork), 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the swordfish to individual plates. Top each steak with some of the sauce, dividing it equally, then drizzle Basil Oil on the fish and on the plate. Garnish each steak with the basil.
