Combine all the salsa ingredients in a medium-size bowl. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 1 hour. To prepare the tuna, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper in a large shallow bowl. Add the tuna steaks, turning to coat, and let sit for 15 minutes. Turn them once as they sit. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Sear the tuna steaks for 4 to 5 minutes on the first side, adding any remaining marinade, or extra oil, if necessary, to prevent sticking. Turn the tuna, and sear it for 3 minutes on the second side for medium-rare (see Note). Using a spatula, transfer the tuna steaks to eight dinner plates. Spoon the salsa, with its juices, over the tuna, and garnish with the chopped cilantro. Serve immediately.
