Rinse the gizzard, heart, and neck, and trim all fat, membranes, and blood. Put the giblets in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and add the thyme, onion, celery, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and simmer 45 minutes, or until the gizzard is tender. Meanwhile, cook the liver under the roasting bird 5-10 minutes or saut√© lightly in some butter. Strain the giblets, reserve the broth, and finely dice the gizzard, liver, and heart.
