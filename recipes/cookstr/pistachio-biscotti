Heat oven to 350°F (180°C) with oven rack in middle. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl. Beat butter and brown sugar in bowl of a heavy-duty mixer on Medium-High speed until creamy, scraping down sides of bowl once or twice. Add vanilla and eggs, one at a time, beating after each, and scrape down sides of bowl once or twice. Reduce mixer speed to Low speed and add the flour mixture. Scrape down sides of bowl and beat until dough forms. By hand, stir in pistachios and white chocolate chips. Gather dough together on lightly floured work surface and divide in half. If dough is slightly sticky, dust you hands with flour. Shape each half into a 12-inch (30-cm) log and place on prepared cooking sheet, about 4 inches (10 cm) apart. Flatten logs slightly. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until firm to the touch. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F (150°C). Allow logs to cool 15 minutes. Slice logs diagonally into ¾-inch (2-cm) slices. Return slices to the cookie sheet. Bake 8 to 12 minutes longer or until lightly browned, turning slices over once to toast second side. Cool on wire cooling rack. Store tightly covered.
