Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease three 8-inch round cake pans with canola oil, line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper, and then lightly grease the parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the baking mix, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, xanthan gum, and salt. In a small bowl, combine the water and flaxseed meal and allow to thicken for 3 to 5 minutes. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the sugar and oil. Add in the vanilla and then the flaxseed mixture and beat for 1 minute. Stir in the dry ingredients and then fold in the shredded carrots and the raisins. Pour the batter into the prepared pans, smooth the tops with a knife, and bake for 30 minutes, or until the cakes are golden and a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean. Let the cakes cool completely in their pans on a cooling rack. Turn the cakes out of the pans and remove the parchment paper. Frost the top of each cake layer with the frosting. Transfer 1 layer to a serving plate and stack the other layers on top. Frost the sides of the cake. Store the frosted cake, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days.
