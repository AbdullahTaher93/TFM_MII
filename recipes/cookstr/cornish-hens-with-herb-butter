Process to a paste the butter, parsley, chives, rosemary, thyme, and fresh sage in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Carefully separate the skin from the breast of each bird. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the herb butter between the skin and breast of each bird. Smooth the skin into place and truss. Preheat oven to 450°F. Rub the oil over the birds and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Finally, rub the dried sage evenly over each bird and place in a roasting pan. Roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350°F. Continue roasting until juices run clear when the thickest part of a thigh is pierced, about 40 more minutes. Baste frequently with the pan juices. Serve immediately.
