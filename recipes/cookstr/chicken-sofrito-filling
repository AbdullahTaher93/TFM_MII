Place the chilies and garlic in a mortar and pound to a coarse paste. (You can also do this in a food processor.) Pound in the cumin and white pepper. Heat the oil in a nonreactive small skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and chili mixture and cook until soft but not brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cilantro; tomato, chicken, and salt. Cook until the chicken is done, about 5 minutes. Correct the seasonings, adding salt and while pepper to taste.
