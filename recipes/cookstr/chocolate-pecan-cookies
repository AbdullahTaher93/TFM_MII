Preheat the oven to 375°. Butter a baking sheet. In a medium bowl placed in a skillet of hot but not boiling water, melt the butter and chocolate. Be careful not to splash any water accidentally into the chocolate or the chocolate will “seize” and will not melt properly. Set aside. In an electric mixer, beat the eggs until fluffy, then beat in the sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, very slowly. This should take about 4 minutes. In a mixing bowl, sift the cake flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together. Fold this into the beaten eggs. Fold in the chocolate, then the pecans and vanilla. Drop by the teaspoonful on the baking sheet about 2 inches aparts—these cookies do spread. Bake for 3 minutes on the middle rack, until the cookies are shiny and puffed. Cool and store in an airtight container until ready to serve later the same day.
