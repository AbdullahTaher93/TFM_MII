Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Combine the feta, mint, and nutmeg, and season with black pepper. Lay the filo sheets on top of each other and cut into 3 long strips, 4in (10cm) wide. Taking one strip of pastry at a time, brush with butter. Place a heaping teaspoon of the cheese mixture at one end. Roll up the pastry into a cylinder, stopping after rolling one-third to fold over the long sides of the filo to completely enclose the filling, then finish rolling. Make sure the ends are tightly sealed. Transfer to the baking sheet and cover with a damp paper towel. Do not let the pastries touch each other. Lightly brush another baking sheet with the butter. Arrange the pastries on the sheet and brush with the remaining butter. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Serve hot or warm. Variation: Spinach Boreks: Substitute the cheese filling for the following mixture: Sautè 2 chopped scallions in 1 tbsp olive oil. Stir in 5oz (140g) baby spinach leaves; cook until wilted. Drain, cool, then chop finely. Mix in ½ cup crumbled feta cheese and 1 tbsp chopped dill. Season with salt and pepper.
