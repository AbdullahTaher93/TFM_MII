First the tabil (To make 1/3 cup): Combine the caraway seeds, coriander seeds, and good quality curry powder in a coffee grinder (if you’re using a blender, you’ll need to double these quantities) and puree to a powder, about 2 minutes. (Most recipes for tabil call for red pepper, but since we add it later to the harissa, there’s no need to use it here.) The tabil will keep in a small jar in the freezer for up to a year. Now the harissa: Cut the stems off the chilies and then cut the chilies lengthwise in half. Brush out the seeds. Put the chilies in a bowl and pour over 2 cups of boiling water. Let the chilies soak until they become pliable and leathery, about 30 minutes. Drain, squeeze out the excess water, and discard the soaking liquid. Coarsely chop the chilies. Combine the chilies and the rest of the ingredients except the extra virgin olive oil in a blender and puree until smooth. Spoon the mixture into a bowl and work in the extra virgin olive oil a tablespoon at a time. (I don't put the extra virgin olive oil in the blender with the rest of the ingredients because it sometimes turns bitter.)
