To Make the Sauce: Process all the ingredients in a blender until very smooth. To Make the Noodles: Use a mandoline to slice the zucchini into long, flat strips (a). Stack the strips, and with a knife slice the zucchini into fettuccine-like ribbons (b). To Assemble: In a large bowl, very gently combine the sauce and noodles, using only enough sauce to coat the noodles. You may have extra sauce left over. Garnish with the diced tomatoes, finely chopped thyme, and freshly ground pepper.
