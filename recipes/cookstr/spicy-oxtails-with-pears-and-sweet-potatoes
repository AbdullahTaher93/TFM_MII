Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 275°F. In a large cast-iron pot or Dutch oven over mediumhigh heat, warm the olive oil. Season the oxtails with salt and pepper and sear until golden brown on all sides, about 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the oxtails to a plate and spoon off all but 1 tablespoon fat. Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the garlic, gingerroot, and chili powder to the pot. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes (be careful not to burn the chili powder). Add the onions and sauté until translucent, about 10 minutes. Raise the heat to medium. Deglaze the pot by adding the vermouth and soy sauce and scraping up any browned bits clinging to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the hoisin sauce and red chili paste. Return the oxtails to the pot. Stir in 1 cup water, the sugar, and sesame seeds and bring to a simmer. Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and braise for 3 hours, adding the sweet potatoes and pears after 1½ hours and the scallions after 2½ hours.
