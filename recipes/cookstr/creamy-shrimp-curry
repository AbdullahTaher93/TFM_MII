Heat the oil in a wok or skillet and add the onions and cook on medium-low heat for at least 6 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. (The objective is to let these sweat and turn into a pale golden saucy state.) Add the ginger paste, garlic paste, and chilies and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is cooked and aromatic. Increase the heat to medium and add the cardamom pods, sour cream, shrimp, turmeric, and salt and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture begins to bubble. Add Â½ cup water and cook for 6 minutes, until the mixture is nice and thick and the shrimp are cooked through. Stir in the cilantro. Enjoy over white rice.
