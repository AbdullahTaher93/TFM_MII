Set a small saucepan of water over high heat and bring to a boil. Add the tomatillos and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool. In a small food processor, combine the tomatillos, cilantro, serrano, and green onion. Process until fairly smooth. Halve the avocado and remove the pit. With a large spoon, scoop the flesh into a bowl. With a fork, roughly mash the avocado. Stir in the tomatillo mixture and the salt. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and hold at room temperature for no more than 30 minutes before using.
