Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the soybean sauce, tomato paste, fish sauce, and chili paste. In a small bowl, combine the peanut butter, sugar, and water. Stir into the soybean mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the sauce into individual serving bowls and sprinkle with the sesame seeds and peanuts. Serve at room temperature.
