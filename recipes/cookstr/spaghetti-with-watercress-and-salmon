Trim the thicker stalks of the watercress and discard. Chop the rest roughly. (You should get about 4 cups [1 L] packed down.) Set aside. In a large deep frying pan, heat oil, salt and pepper over high heat for 1 minute. Add garlic and lemon zest; stirfry for 1 minute or until garlic starts to brown. Add watercress and stir-fry for 1 minute until it is thoroughly wilted and significantly reduced in volume. Add lemon juice and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in chicken stock. Add the Gorgonzola in small dollops; cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling. Stir in salmon and most of the dill; remove from heat and cover. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the spaghetti until tender but firm; drain. Remove cover from frying pan and return to medium high heat. Cook for 1 minute; add the spaghetti. Toss gently and combine for 1 to 2 minutes or until the pasta is coated with sauce. Serve immediately, garnished with pine nuts and the remainder of the dill.
