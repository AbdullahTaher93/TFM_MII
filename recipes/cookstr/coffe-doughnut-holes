Cream the sugar and butter in a large mixer bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together. Dissolve the instant coffee in the hot water. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk and coffee to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition. The dough should be fairly stiff but smooth. Cover and refrigerate the dough at least 2 hours or overnight. Divide the dough into 5 parts. Roll out 1 part dough ½ inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Keep the remaining dough refrigerated. Cut the dough into holes with a small round cookie cutter. Gather the scraps, roll, and cut out many additional holes as possible. Heat vegetable oil to 375°F in a deep-fat fryer. Fry the doughnut holes, 8 to 10 at a time, turning once with tongs, until the holes are a deep golden brown. Drain on paper towels and then roll in a shallow bowl of cinnamon sugar. Repeat with the remaining dough.
