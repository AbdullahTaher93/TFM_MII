In a colander or strainer, drain the tomatoes thoroughly to remove all the liquid. Crush the tomatoes lightly to remove any liquid inside the tomatoes and drain again. Transfer the tomatoes to a bowl and crush to a pulp using your hand, a potato masher, or the back of a spoon. (Alternatively, drain the tomatoes and coarsely crush the tomatoes in a food processor.) Stir in the salt. Use immediately, or store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before using.
