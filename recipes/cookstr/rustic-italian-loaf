For the starter, stir the flour, yeast, and water in a bowl until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, coat with oil, and cover. Let stand in a warm place for at least 12 hours, until it triples in volume and has an acidic aroma. The next day, combine the starter and water in a large bowl. Add the flour, oil, yeast, and salt and stir until the dough comes together. It will be very wet and sticky. Fold the dough over on itself in the bowl for a few minutes, until it begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 425째F (220째C). Lightly oil a baking sheet. Punch down the dough. Knead the dough on a floured work surface until smooth and elastic. Mold the dough into an oval shape. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375째F (190째C) and bake for 30 minutes more, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Let cool on a wire rack.
