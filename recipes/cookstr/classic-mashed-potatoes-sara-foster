Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a low boil and cook, uncovered, 25 to 30 minutes, until the potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. Drain the potatoes and return them to the saucepan while still warm. Add the butter and milk and mash with a potato masher until all the butter and milk are incorporated and the potatoes are creamy. (Note: If you like smooth mashed potatoes, use an electric hand mixer instead of a masher and beat until smooth.) Season with salt and pepper; drizzle with Chive Oil, and serve immediately. To Make the Chive Oil: Place the chives, parsley, oil, and salt in the container of a blender and blend at high speed for about 3 to 4 minutes, until completely pureed. Strain the mixture through a sieve, pressing with the back of a wooden spoon to remove all the fibrous threads of the chives. Refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use. Remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before serving and shake to blend thoroughly. Variations: For low-fat mashed potatoes, omit the butter and add just enough skim milk, plain yogurt, or buttermilk, plus a few teaspoons of olive oil, to reach the desired consistency. Either way— classic or low-fat—the potatoes can be flavored with blue cheese; pureed roasted garlic; Parmesan cheese; chopped caramelized onions; cooked, crumbled bacon; or chopped fresh herbs. Different types of potatoes can also be used: try Yukon gold, new potatoes (with or without the peel), or peeled sweet potatoes.
