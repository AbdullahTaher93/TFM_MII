Place all the ingredients and Â¼ cup warm water in a blender and blend till smooth. To get the right consistency, you will need to pulse the mixture a few times and then blend it smoothly for 5 minutes. Save and store in the refrigerator for a few days (but it will turn slightly darker due to oxidation).
