Dice the bread slices into ½-inch cubes and dry overnight or in an oven at 300°F for about 10 minutes. In a large heavy-bottomed skillet, cook the chopped bacon. When the bacon is just browned, add the crushed red pepper and garlic. Sauté for 1 minute. Add the diced veggies and continue to sauté for 3 to 4 minutes until the onion and pepper are just soft. Add the chopped clam meat and reserved clam juice and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. The mixture should boil. Remove from heat and stir in the dried bread cubes, parsley, and black pepper. Allow the mixture to cool a bit before stuffing into shells. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Make sure the clamshells are clean. Mound the mixture into each half shell and place the filled shells on a baking tray. Baked stuffed quahogs for 20 to 25 minutes or until nicely browned on top. 8. Serve with lemon and lime wedges.
