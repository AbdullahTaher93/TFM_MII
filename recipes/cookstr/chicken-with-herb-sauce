Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the chicken in a roasting pan. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and parsley and enough water to cover. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, uncover, and let cool. Pulse the parsley, basil, capers, vinegar, anchovies, and garlic in a food processor until combined. With the machine running, slowly pour in the oil. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the chicken from the liquid and thinly slice across the grain. Transfer to a platter, top with the sauce, and serve.
