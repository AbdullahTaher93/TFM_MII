Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C, or gas mark 4). Combine the thyme, sesame seeds, sumac, and ½ teaspoon salt. Sprinkle lemons with salt and stuff inside the chicken cavity. Cover chicken with the spice blend and place in a roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil. Bake uncovered for 50 to 60 minutes or until the skin is crispy and the leg meat is no longer pink when cut into (about 160°F [70°F] internal temperature). Serve immediately.
