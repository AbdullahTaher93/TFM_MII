Do ahead: Vegetables can be chopped up to one day ahead and stored in the refrigerator. Dressing can be made up to five days ahead and stored in the refrigerator. Separate bok choy leaves. Rinse and pat dry. Chop bok choy into approximately ½-inch pieces. Combine these in a large bowl with scallions, red pepper, bean sprouts, carrots, snow peas and jalapeño. If making in advance, keep red peppers separate. In a small bowl, make the dressing by whisking together ginger, garlic, cilantro, orange zest, vegetable oil, sesame oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and sugar. Whisk until sugar is dissolved. Pour dressing over salad and toss. Allow salad to sit for 30 minutes before serving. Garnish with cashews and serve.
