In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the carrot, onion, and garlic and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, marjoram, ground fennel, and tomatoes. Season with the salt, pepper, and cayenne and simmer for about 20 minutes. Stir in the vegetarian sausage and red pepper flakes to taste, and simmer 5 minutes longer to blend the flavors. Keep warm over low heat. Cook the cavatelli in a large pot of salted boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it is al dente. Drain and divide it among individual plates or shallow bowls. Top with the sauce, a few shavings of Parmesan, and a sprinkling of parsley. Serve immediately, passing additional cheese at the table.
