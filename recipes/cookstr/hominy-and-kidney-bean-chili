In a heavy 4-quart Dutch oven, heat the oil. Stir in the onion and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Lower the heat to medium. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, garlic, and cinnamon, and cook for another minute. Stir in the oregano. Add the tomatoes, hominy, beans, and zucchini. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and additional chili powder, if needed. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer until the zucchini is tender but still firm, 8 to 12 minutes. Stir in the roasted red pepper and cilantro just before serving. Ladle into soup bowls and accompany with bowls of lime wedges and grated cheese.
