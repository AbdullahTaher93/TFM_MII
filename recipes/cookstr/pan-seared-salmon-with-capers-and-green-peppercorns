1 Sprinkle the salt in a heavy skillet and heat over mediumhigh heat until nearly smoking. Add the salmon and sear for about 2 minutes, then turn and sear on the other side for about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, sprinkle with the pepper, and then pour in the wine and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice. Cover and cook until the liquid is nearly absorbed, another 3 to 4 minutes. 2 Uncover and pour in 2 more tablespoons of the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the water. Re-cover and cook just until the fish is opaque throughout, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the salmon to warmed individual plates or a platter. 3 Add the remaining 4 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 tablespoon water and stir to scrape up any bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. Add the capers and peppercorns and cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds. Pour the pan juices evenly over the salmon and serve at once.
