Wash the cranberries and discard any that are soft or spoiled. Finely grate the zest of the orange. Cut away and discard all the white pith, and cut the orange into a few pieces. Put the orange pieces and the grated zest into the container of a blender with enough water to make one cup, and process until the orange is roughly chopped. Combine the liquid in a heavy-bottomed saucepan with the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves, and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the cranberries, return to a boil, and stir over medium heat for 8–10 minutes. Use a long handled wooden spoon—this stuff can really spit. When most of the cranberries have popped and the liquid is somewhat thickened, the sauce is done. Pour it into a serving dish and allow it to cool, then chill.
