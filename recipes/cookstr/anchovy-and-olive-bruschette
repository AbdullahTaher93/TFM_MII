Preheat the broiler and position the rack 6in (15cm) from the heat. Broil the bread slices until toasted golden on both sides. Rub 1 side of each slice with the garlic clove. Brush the garlic side of each slice with about 2 tsp olive oil. For each bruschetta, spread the toasted bread with about 2 tsp marinara sauce and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Put 1 slice of mozzarella on each, sprinkle with the herbs, and top with 2 pieces of anchovy in a criss-cross pattern. Broil for 2â€“3 minutes, or until the mozzarella has melted. Serve hot, sprinkled with the olives.
