To make the babas, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Beat the milk, eggs, and butter together and pour into the well. Mix 3-4 minutes to make a smooth, thick batter. Stir in the raisins. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Generously butter 4 baba molds. Divide the batter among the molds. Cover with oiled plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place about 30 minutes, until doubled. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the tops are light gold and spring back when pressed. Transfer to a wire rack and cool for 5 minutes. Unmold onto the rack and cool completely. To make the syrup, bring the sugar and ½ cup water to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil for 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool completely. Stir in the rum. Use a wooden skewer to pierce holes over the surfaces of the babas. Transfer the babas to the syrup and let stand, turning often, until soaked. Stand each baba on a dessert plate. Just before serving, whip the cream and confectioner's sugar just until soft peaks form. Transfer the cream to a pastry bag fitted with an open star tip, and pipe a rosette on each baba. Grate a little chocolate on each baba and serve with the remaining whipped cream. Variations: Summer Fruit Babas: As a lighter summer variation, top the babas with summer berries rather than whipped cream. Prune and Armagnac Babas: Substitute finely chopped prunes for the raisins, and Armagnac for the rum. Scatter a few chopped dried plums over the whipped cream instead of the chocolate.
