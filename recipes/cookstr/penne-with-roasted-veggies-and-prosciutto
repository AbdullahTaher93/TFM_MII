Preheat oven to 450ÂºF. In a large bowl, toss vegetables with oil, rosemary, garlic, season with salt and pepper; spread out in a single layer on rimmed baking sheet. Roast veggies, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned. This takes about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions; drain. Toss pasta, vegetables and Prosciutto together; taste for seasoning. Serve with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, if desired.
