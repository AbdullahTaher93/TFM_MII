. Chop up or slice your onion, garlic and 4 cups (1 L) of vegetables. I usually put in one bowl the vegetables that need the most cooking, such as carrots and broccoli. In a second bowl I put the vegetables that need less cooking, such as bean sprouts. Put the bowls’ of vegetables to the side. Place the raw meat (or other protein choice) in your cold wok or frying pan. Sprinkle the bouillon mix on your meat and stir. Add 2 tablespoons (25 mL) of water. Heat up your wok or frying pan and cook for about 3 minutes. If you are using cooked leftover meat instead of raw meat, it doesn’t need to be cooked first. Add the onions, garlic and first bowl of vegetables. Stir at high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until cooked. Now add the second bowl of vegetables. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch, ¼ cup (50 mL) of cold water, soy sauce and ginger. Add this to your wok. Cook for another minute or two.
