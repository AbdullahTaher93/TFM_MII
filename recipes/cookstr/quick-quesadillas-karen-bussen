Spread refried beans on each of the tortillas. On 4 tortillas, sprinkle enough of each cheese to cover the tortilla, leaving a little space at the edge. Cover with the remaining 4 tortillas, bean-side pressed against the cheese. In a medium skillet on medium-high heat, warm the olive oil, then cook the tortillas one at a time until theyâ€™re golden brown on both sides and the cheese is melted. Slice into quarters and serve with fresh salsa on top and sour cream on the side.
