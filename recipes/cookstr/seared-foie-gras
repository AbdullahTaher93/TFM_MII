Score the top of each medallion in a diamond pattern and season generously on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat a saut√©: pan over medium-high heat. Lay the medallions in the pan, scored side down. Sear for 30 seconds on each side, until golden brown. The seared foie gras should have no resistance when pressed. Transfer to a plate. Follow the assembly and serving directions for the variation you are making.
