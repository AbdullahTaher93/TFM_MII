Prepare the sauce. Place the prunes and soaking water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Add the honey and cinnamon. Mix well and simmer until the prunes absorb some water and soften (they should be soft yet retain most of their shape), about 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Prepare the chicken. Rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Place on a plate. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook the onions, stirring, until golden and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and brown, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Add the salt, pepper, cinnamon sticks, and water, stir well, and bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat. Pour the sauce over the chicken. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Uncover the skillet and cook until some of the excess liquid cooks off and the sauce has thickened to a gravy-like texture, an additional 20 to 30 minutes. Serve in large platter, garnished with the toasted almonds.
