Bring the olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 cup water to a boil in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan. Heat the couscous in a dry skillet over medium-high heat, gently shaking the pan, until the couscous begins to exude a toasty aroma, about 3 minutes. Remove the saucepan of boiling water from the heat, stir in the toasted couscous, cover, and let stand until the water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Use a fork to fluff the couscous into individual grains. (To make ahead, cool then refrigerate in a covered container for up to 1 day. Reheat in a covered casserole in a preheated 350Â°F oven until warm, about 15 minutes.) Just before serving, stir in the onions, pomegranate seeds, mint, and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Add salt, pepper, and additional lemon juice to taste.
