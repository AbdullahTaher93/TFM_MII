Put the steak in a small bowl and dust it with a little bit of chili powderâ€”several good-size pinches will do; set aside. To assemble the salad, core the lettuce and cut into a number of thin wedges. Arrange 3 wedges in a fan-shaped pattern on each individual salad plate, leaving a little room between the wedges. Place a few tomato wedges in one of the spaces. Score the flesh of the avocado down to the skin. Scoop out the flesh and scatter the avocado dice in the other space between the wedges. Make the dressing by blending all of the dressing ingredients together in a medium-size bowl. Either spoon dressing over each salad, or pass the dressing at the table.
