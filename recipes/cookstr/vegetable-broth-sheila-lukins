Rinse all the vegetables well. Stud the onion with the cloves. Place all the ingredients in a large heavy pot, add 10 cups water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Taste, adjust the seasonings, and simmer for 30 minutes more. Strain the broth and allow it to cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate it, covered, or freeze it. Refrigerated, it will keep for up to 4 days; frozen, for up to 3 months.
