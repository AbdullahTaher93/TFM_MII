Preheat the oven to 500°. Place the bones in a large roasting pan, and brown in the oven, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a stockpot, heat the oil over high heat. Add the carrots and onions and cook, occasionally scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until well browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the browned bones to the stockpot and cover with the water. Add all the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil, 30 to 45 minutes. Reduce the heat and, simmer, uncovered, for 3½ hours. Skim the surface several times during the simmering to remove any foam that appears. 6. Strain and allow the stock to cool uncovered before refrigerating. Remove any fat from the surface when cold, or before using. Freeze the portion not used, or reduce to form meat glaze (Glace de Viande). Four quarts of stock will reduce to yield about 1½ cups of glace de viande. Variations
