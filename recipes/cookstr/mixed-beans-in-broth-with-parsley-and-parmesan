Put the beans in a pressure cooker with the aromatics, oil, and 2 quarts water. Bring the pressure to high and cook for 25 minutes. Release the pressure, add 1Â½ teaspoons salt, and if they need more cooking, return the beans to pressure for 5 minutes or simmer until tender. Remove the aromatics. Taste the beans for salt. Serve them, with a little of their broth, in soup bowls with olive oil drizzled over the top, the parsley-garlic mixture, and pepper. Grate the cheese over all or pass it separately.
