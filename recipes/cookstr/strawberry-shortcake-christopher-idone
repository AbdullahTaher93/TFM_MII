Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Dough: In a large bowl, sift together the dry ingredients and mix in the butter. Fold in the cream. On a lightly-floured surface, divide the dough into 4 pieces, and pat into 1-inch-thick rounds. Bake on an ungreased baking sheet for 35 minutes, until golden. Filling: Hull and slice the strawberries, mix with sugar. Split the shortcakes and spoon the filling onto the bottom half. Replace the tops and serve with whipped cream.
