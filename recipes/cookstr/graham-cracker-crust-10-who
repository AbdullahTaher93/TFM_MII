In a large bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, butter and brown sugar, mixing well. Transfer crumb mixture to prepared pie plate, pressing into bottom and up side of pan. Chill crust until firm. Fill with prepared filling or, alternatively, bake crust in preheated 350°F (180°C) oven for 10 minutes or until crust is set and fragrant. Variation: Spiced Crust: Add ¼ to ½ tsp (1 to 2 mL) ground ginger or cinnamon to the crumb mixture.
