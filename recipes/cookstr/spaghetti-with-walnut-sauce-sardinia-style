Grind the walnuts in a food processor until they are fairly finely ground but not pasty. Be careful not to grind too long or the oil in the nuts will be released. In a skillet large enough to accommodate the cooked pasta later, heat together the ground nuts, olive oil, garlic, and parsley over gentle heat until the garlic is softened but not colored, about 7 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside. Meanwhile, bring the water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add the pasta and salt. Stir immediately and continue to cook over high heat until the water returns to a boil. Keep the heat on high and stir frequently to prevent the pasta from sticking together. When the pasta is not quite al dente (still slightly undercooked), drain it, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water. While the pasta is still dripping, transfer it to the skillet with the sauce. Using two large forks and keeping the gentlest possible heat under the skillet, distribute the sauce well through pasta. Add as much of the 1 cup reserved cooking water as you need to moisten the sauce, adding it little by little; it is not likely that you will need more than Â½ cup of it. Add the cheese to the pasta, toss, then remove from the heat and transfer to a warmed serving bowl. Serve immediately.
