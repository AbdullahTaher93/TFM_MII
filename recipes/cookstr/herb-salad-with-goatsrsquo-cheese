Preheat your oven to 400°F. Chop or pound your marjoram and add to a bowl with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of pepper. Rub this mixture all over the goat’s cheese then bake in the preheated oven for around 10 minutes until nice and golden. Add your arugula, fennel, olives and basil to a bowl and dress your salad with around 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and your lemon juice, and season. Divide onto 4 plates, crumble over your tasty goats' cheese and sprinkle over your chilli to finish... fantastic!
