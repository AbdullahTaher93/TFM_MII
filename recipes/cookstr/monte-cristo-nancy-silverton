TO MAKE THE BATTER: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, cayenne, and salt. Whisk in the club soda and beer. The mixture should be the consistency of pancake batter. Refrigerate until you’re ready to use it. TO ASSEMBLE THE SANDWICHES: Set half of the slices buttered side down, and cover with the cheese slices, folding them over if they extend past the edges. Layer the ham and turkey over the cheese, and spread the jam over the turkey. Place the top slice of bread on, buttered side up. Grill the sandwiches (see Note). Pour the oil into a deep heavy-duty saucepan to fill it halfway. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, measuring the temperature on a deep-fat thermometer. Cut the sandwiches on a diagonal into thirds, to make 9 triangular pieces. Stir the batter. Dip each sandwich piece into the batter, thoroughly coating it. Fry the pieces 2 or 3 at a time, being careful not to overcrowd them in the pan. Cook them for about 3 minutes on each side, until they’re nicely browned, and transfer to a paper towel to drain. Allow the oil to come back up to temperature before you fry the next batch of sandwiches. Place the sandwiches on a platter. Sift a very heavy layer of powdered sugar over them, and serve with a side of jam.
