Heat the oil in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until softened. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the salt, cumin, cayenne, allspice, and cinnamon. Add the lamb, breadcrumbs, egg, and sesame seeds and combine well. Form the mixture into ¼-inch meatballs, arranging them on a tray. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Bake the meatballs in the upper third of the oven until golden and just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the chutney and orange juice in a large saucepan. Toss in the cooked meatballs and stir gently to coat. Remove the meatballs to a warm serving platter and serve with the yogurt dip.
