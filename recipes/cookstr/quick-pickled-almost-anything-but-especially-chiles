Prep the vegetables or chiles. Peel and remove any mushy parts and cut into equal-sized chunks if necessary. If you want to leave jalape√±os, serranos, and other hot peppers whole, pierce each one with the tip of a knife three or four times. Fill a quart jar with the vegetables or chiles. In a medium saucepan, combine the water, vinegar, garlic, salt, sugar, and pickling spice, if using, and bring to a simmer, stirring until the salt and sugar are dissolved. Pour the warm brine into the jar. Because you are not processing these pickles, the headspace is not critical, but do make sure all the vegetables are submerged. If they are floating above the brine, insert a smaller jar into the large jar to push the vegetables down into the brine. Let cool, then cap the jar. Some foods, like thin-sliced onions, will be ready in 20 minutes. Others, like chile peppers, may take 3 or 4 days. Taste to judge the progress; a good pickle will be salty, acidic, and crisp. Most vegetable quickles will get sharper, tangier, and more pickled (and less crisp) every day, but the texture will suffer after 2 weeks. They should be discarded after a month.
