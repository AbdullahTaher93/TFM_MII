At least 3 hours and up to 2 days before you plan to smoke the lamb chops, start preparing the beans. In a large, heavy saucepan, combine the beans with the water, onion, and garlic. Bring the beans to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook the beans until they are very tender but still holding their shape, about 2 hours. Stir in the salt after the beans have softened. The cooking time may vary depending on the variety of beans and the altitude. Stir the beans up from the bottom occasionally and add more hot water to the pot if the beans are getting dry before they soften. Keep the beans warm over very low heat or refrigerate and cover them. (You will finish making the beans while the chops cook.) At least 2 hours and up to 1 day before you plan to smoke the lamb chops, combine the paste ingredients in a small bowl. Massage the chops with the paste, wrap them in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. Remove the chops from the refrigerator and let them sit covered at room temperature for 30 minutes. Warm a heavy skillet over high heat. Sear the chops quickly on both sides. Transfer them to the smoker, and cook the chops until their internal temperature is 150° F, or medium-rare, about 45 to 55 minutes at a cooking temperature of 225° F to 250° F. While the chops cook, finish the beans, first rewarming them if needed. Mix together the oil with the rosemary, thyme, marjoram, lemon juice, and pepper, and reserve. Arrange 2 lamb chops on each plate and spoon the beans beside the chops. Drizzle equal portions of the herbed oil over the beans and serve, garnished with rosemary, thyme, or marjoram if you wish.
