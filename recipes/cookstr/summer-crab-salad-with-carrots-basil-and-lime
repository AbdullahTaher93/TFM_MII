Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the diced carrots and simmer 2-3 minutes; drain and shock in ice water. Remove the carrots from ice water and set aside. Place the lime juice and zest, shallots, and vinegar in a small bowl and whisk in the olive oil. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and hot sauce. In another bowl, mix the basil, scallions, crabmeat, capers, and carrots, and then fold in the lime vinaigrette. Taste for seasonings, adding hot sauce, lime juice, or salt as needed. To serve, arrange a few lettuce leaves on each of the salad plates. Top the lettuce with equal portions of the crab salad and avocado slices, and garnish with basil sprigs.
