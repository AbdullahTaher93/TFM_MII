Make the pastry. In a clean mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Mix until the ingredients are combined and the mixture is crumbly. In a separate clean mixing bowl, combine the egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract, and lemon zest, and lightly beat with a fork. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and beat with a mixer on low speed for about 2 minutes, until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Dust your hands with flour and knead the dough for about 1 minute, until it is smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour (or up to 4 days). If you chill the dough for longer than 1 hour, let it warm slightly before rolling it out. Grease a tart dish. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 14 inch (0.5 cm) and place it in the prepared dish. Trim the excess dough off the edges. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Make the filling. In a saucepan, combine the flour, cocoa, and sugar and stir until thoroughly mixed. In a separate saucepan, warm the milk over medium heat, but do not let it boil. Remove the milk from the heat and slowly add it to the flour mixture, whisking to break up any lumps. Bring the milk-flour mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture forms a custard-like consistency. Remove the filling from the heat and transfer it to a clean mixing bowl. Add the orange zest and let it cool. . Spread the cool chocolate filling into the tart shell. Bake for 30 minutes.
