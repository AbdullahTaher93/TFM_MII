Combine molasses, sugar and vinegar in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan and stir over low heat until sugar dissolves. Cover pan and boil without stirring until mixture reaches 245° on a candy thermometer or forms a firm ball when a little is dropped into cold water. Stir in butter and simmer slowly until mixture crackles when a little is dropped into cold water, or reaches 270° on a candy thermometer. Pour into a buttered pan or onto a marble slab. When taffy is cool enough to handle, spread a little bland oil on your hands, and taking a small amount of taffy at a time, stretch it to about a 14-inch length; fold it back on itself and pull again. Continue until all of the taffy has been pulled to a point where it is creamy, light in color and no longer transparent and the ends hold a shape. Stretch to a ½-inch diameter, and using a pair of oiled scissors, cut into small squares or twist and form sticks or circles. Cool on a rack until hardened and wrap in waxed paper.
