Fill a large stockpot one-third full of cold water. Add all of the ingredients except the crawfish and boil for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, soak the crawfish in salted cold water for about 15 minutes; rinse. Strain the stock and discard the vegetables. Place the crawfish in the liquid and add water to cover, if necessary. Bring to a rolling boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Drain and serve. To make Boiled Shrimp, use 5 pounds shrimp instead of the crawfish and remove the shrimp as soon as they come to a boil. Creamers (baby new potatoes) are the usual accompaniment, cooked in the same crawfish liquor.
