Bring a medium heavy saucepan of water to a boil; salt liberally. Stir in the rice, reduce to a simmer, and cook until the rice is tender but still slightly firm, about 20 minutes. Drain the rice well and return it to the hot pan, or transfer it to a warm serving dish. Toss with the butter, basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the mozzarella, stirring until it is stringy and melted. Serve at once, passing the Parmigiano-Reggiano on the side.
