For the braised duck legs: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Season the duck legs well with salt and pepper. Over medium-high heat, heat a medium skillet until smoking and sear the legs, skin-side down, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and sear the flesh side 1 minute. Place the legs skin-side up in a pot large enough to hold them snugly and add the stock, spices, and herbs. Bring to a boil over high heat and then place in the oven for 1 hour. Reduce the oven to 375°F., turn the legs, and cook 30 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and cool in the cooking liquid. Remove the duck legs when cool and discard the cooking liquid, which will be fatty. Discard the duck skin and pull the meat from the bones (it will come off very easily) and shred it. To serve: Toss the greens with the vinaigrette, cranberries, walnuts, and duck. Season lightly with salt and pepper, toss, and divide among 4 serving plates. Variations: For Chicken Stock, substitute Duck Stock, or a combination of duck and chicken stocks. For Walnut Vinaigrette, substitute Sherry Vinaigrette. For walnuts, substitute pine nuts.
