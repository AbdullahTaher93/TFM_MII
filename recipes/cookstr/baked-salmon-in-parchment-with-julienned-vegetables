Position racks in the center and top third of the oven and preheat to 375Â°F. Cut four 14-inch-wide pieces of parchment paper and fold each in half lengthwise. Cut out a wide curve from each piece of parchment, so when it is unfolded you have a heart shape about 12 inches wide. Brush each piece of parchment with oil. Place a salmon fillet on the bottom half of each heart and season the fillet with salt and pepper to taste. Mix the carrot, leek, zucchini, tomatoes, shallots, parsley, and tarragon in a medium bowl, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Divide the vegetables evenly over the top of each fillet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon each of olive oil and wine over each fillet. Fold the top half of each heart down, and crimp the edges tightly to seal. (The packets may be made up to 3 hours ahead and refrigerated until ready to bake.) Place the parchment hearts on 2 baking sheets. Bake until the parchment is lightly browned, about 12 minutes for medium-rare salmon. Place each parchment heart on a dinner plate. Serve immediately with lemon wedges. Let your guests pierce open their parchment hearts with the tip of a sharp knife (provide scissors, if you wish), being careful of any escaping steam.
