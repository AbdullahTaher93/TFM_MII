Preheat the oven to 500°F. Generously grease a large baking sheet. Cut the potatoes lengthwise into 1/3-inch-thick French fries. Toss them with the oil and ¼ teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Spread them on the pan and roast them in the lower third of the oven for 15 minutes. Turn them over and roast until golden on all sides, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt to taste and serve.
