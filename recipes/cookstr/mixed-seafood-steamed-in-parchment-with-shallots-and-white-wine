Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a medium bowl, combine the garlic, shallots, celery, carrots, 2 tablespoons olive oil, parsley, and dill. In a large bowl, combine the paprika, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and wine. Add the scallops, salmon, or lobster, and shrimp and toss to coat. (The seafood may be marinated ahead of time and refrigerated for up to 8 hours.) Cut parchment paper or heavy aluminum foil into six 14-inch squares. Fold the squares in half to crease, then unfold. Divide the marinated vegetables among the packets, placing them to one side of the crease. Set 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, and a piece of salmon or lobster on top of the vegetables. If desired, tuck a few herbs into the seafood and top with a slice of lemon or lime. Fold the parchment loosely over the seafood, roll the edges together, and crimp to secure. Set the packages on a large baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Set the packages on individual plates and serve right away, while very hot. Open the packages at the table, either by unfolding or by cutting an X in the parchment with scissors.
