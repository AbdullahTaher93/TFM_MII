In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for the tzatziki. Chill until ready to serve. In a bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, oats, yeast, mint, and coriander. Place the zucchini in a clean towel and squeeze out any excess liquid, then add to the flour mixture, tossing to ensure that the pieces are coated in flour. Add the scallions, red chile, and salt and pepper to taste. Gently stir in the yogurt, adding a little water if the mixture feels too dry. Set aside for 10 minutes for the baking powder to begin to activate. Heat a skillet or griddle until very hot, then coat with a little oil. Using about Â¼ cup of fritter batter, drop the batter onto the hot skillet and spread out with a spatula. Cook until bubbles rise to the surface of the fritter and the base is golden brown, then turn and cook the other side. Remove and keep warm while you make the next fritters. Serve with the tzatziki.
