To prepare the dressing, whisk together in a large bowl the oil, vinegar, garlic, mustard, black pepper, salt, and cumin. Add the beans, bell peppers, onion, and jalapeno peppers. Mix well. Taste and adjust seasoning. Cover and refrigerate until 30 minutes before serving. Serve on lettuce, if desired.
