LONG-SOAK METHOD: Pick over the beans to remove any stones or bad or broken beans. Rinse thoroughly. Put the beans in a stockpot and cover with plenty of cold water. Soak for 6 to 12 hours. (If it's warm, put the beans in the refrigerator.) Drain the beans and return them to the pot with 4 quarts fresh cold water. Wrap the herbs and garlic in a 6-inch square of cheesecloth and add it to the pot. Add the carrot, celery, and onion. Bring the water to a low simmer, then cook until the beans are done. Depending on their freshness and the variety of bean, this can take from 45 minutes to 2 hours. Keep checking them for doneness. After 30 minutes of cooking, add the salt. Remove and discard the cheesecloth bundle and the vegetables and drain. Serve the beans warm, drizzled with olive oil.
