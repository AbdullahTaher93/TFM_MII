Working in two batches, purée the watermelon in a food processor. Strain the purée through a fine mesh sieve, forcing the liquid out with a wooden spoon. Discard the solids. Combine the watermelon puree, mint, lime juice, and sugar in a 9 × 13-inch metal pan. Place the mixture in the freezer, scraping it thoroughly with a fork every 20 to 30 minutes for about 2½ hours, until the granita resembles coarse crystals. Scrape one last time and spoon into parfait glasses or bowls. Top with a mint sprig.
