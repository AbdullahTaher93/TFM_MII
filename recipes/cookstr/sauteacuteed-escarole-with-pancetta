Wash the escarole under cold water, leaf by leaf, to rid it of all grit. Discard any bruised or blemished leaves. Tear the leaves into 2-inch pieces. Bring 4 quarts of water to a wiling boil in a large saucepan. In 2 or 3 batches, parboil escarole for 1 minute and immediately refresh it under cold water to stop the cooking process. When all the escarole is done and cool enough to handle, squeeze out the excess moisture with your hands and set aside. Place the butter and pancetta in a 9-inch skillet. Sauté until the pancetta is crisp. Turn the burner off. Allow to cool for 45 seconds, and then add the garlic. Sauté for about 30 seconds. Add the escarole, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Sauté for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the escarole is tender and hot.
