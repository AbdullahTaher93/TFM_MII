Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, combine the olive oil, parsley, and garlic. Sauté over medium-low heat until the parsley is bright green, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the pasta to the boiling water. Drain the artichoke slivers. Add to the sauté pan along with the white wine and salt to taste. Stir to cover the artichokes with the parsley mixture. Cook over medium-low heat until the artichokes are tender, about 5 minutes. When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain it and toss with the sauce. Serve with Parmesan.
