Place the beef in an extra-deep 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Begin browning the beef, stirring often to break up the meat. Meanwhile, peel and coarsely chop the onions, adding them to the skillet as you chop. Cook, stirring often, until all the meat is crumbled and cooked through, 8 to 12 minutes. Drain any accumulated fat from the skillet. Add the garlic and Worcestershire sauce to the skillet and stir until well blended, 30 seconds. Remove the skillet from the heat and allow the beef to cool enough to be refrigerated or frozen for use in future recipes.
