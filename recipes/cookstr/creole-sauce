Place the garlic, scallion, and Â½ teaspoon of salt in a nonreactive mixing bowl and mash well with the back of a wooden spoon. Add the chives, tomato, Scotch bonnet, and lime juice and whisk to mix. Whisk in the oil in a thin stream; the sauce should thicken slightly. Taste for seasoning, adding pepper and additional salt and/or lime juice as necessary.
