In a large bowl, combine the 1/3 cup olive oil, lemon juice, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, and a grinding or two of pepper and whisk together. Add the squid bodies and tentacles and marinate for 1 hour at room temperature. Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat the broiler. Remove the squid from the marinade and reserve the marinade. Over hot coals or under the broiler, grill the bodies and tentacles until they just begin to firm and turn opaque, only a few minutes. Be careful not to overcook or the calamari will be tough. Slice the bodies into bite-sized rings and the tentacles into bite-sized portions. Set aside. (Do not refrigerate.) Add the tomatoes and onion to the reserved marinade, stir to coat, then drain and grill briefly. Coarsely chop them and then put them in a large bowl with the calamari, garlic, mint, chives, vinegar, and the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Gently stir in the goat cheese. Lightly paint the bread with the remaining olive oil and grill over hot coals until lightly toasted with grill marks. Put a heaping tablespoon or two of the calamari mixture on each toast and garnish with a mint leaf and Fried Capers, if using.
