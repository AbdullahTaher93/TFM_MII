On a clean surface, knead dough for 2 to 3 minutes. Roll into a 1½-inch (4 cm) thick rope. Pinch off 1-inch (2.5 cm) sections and roll into small balls. Place on a plate and cover with a damp cloth. Heat a dry griddle or heavy skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes. Keep chapati flour in a small dish nearby. Sprinkle generous pinch on work surface and spread into a circle with your hand. Flatten ball of dough between your palms to ½-inch (1 cm) thick circle. Place on work surface and use rolling pin to roll into 7- to 8-inch (17.5 cm to 20 cm) circle (chapati). Lift a few times while rolling, sprinkling with just a hint of flour so chapati does not stick to surface. Place chapati on hot dry griddle and cook for 1 minute Flip and make sure some brown spots have appeared on cooked surface. If not, increase heat slightly. Cook second side for 30 to 40 seconds, pressing down on edges with crumpled paper towel. There should be a few brown spots on both sides. Transfer to a piece of foil or a dish towel and rub surface quickly with ¼ tsp (1 mL) oil. Repeat with remaining dough, keeping cooked chapatis covered and warm.
