1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. (If you have no parchment paper, then grease and flour the pan’s bottom.) 2 Mix all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Add the remaining ingredients except the confectioners’ sugar and mix well until evenly combined. 3 Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and level the surface. Bake in the center of the oven for about 1 hour until risen and golden and a fine metal skewer comes out clean when inserted in the cake. 4 Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack until completely cold. Dust with confectioners’ sugar before serving.
