Lay the spring roll wrapper flat with one corner facing you; put banana across bottom third and sprinkle with one-quarter of the chocolate and ginger if desired. Roll up, tightly tucking in the sides, and seal with the cornstarch mixture (make sure there are no leaks in the wrapping). Repeat for each banana. In wok or deep saucepan, heat oil to 350° F (180° C). Cook spring rolls until golden and crispy, turning once, about 90 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with sifted icing sugar. Serve alone or with ice cream, whipped cream, or coconut custard cream . Variation: Try adding ½ cup (125 ml) chopped nuts or 1 ½ tbsp (20 ml) toasted sesame seeds.
