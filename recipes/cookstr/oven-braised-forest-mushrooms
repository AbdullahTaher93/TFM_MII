Preheat the oven to 375°F. Layer the mushrooms, herbs, and shallots in a lidded covered casserole that’s just large enough to hold them. Dot with the butter or drizzle with the olive oil, sprinkle with the salt, and pour the vermouth over the top. Cover tightly and bake for 1 hour, stirring halfway through the cooking. Serve the mushrooms hot from the casserole.
