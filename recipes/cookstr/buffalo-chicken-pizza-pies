Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Slice the English muffins in half and place on a large baking sheet. Toast in the oven for about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and cook until no longer pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the pasta sauce, Buffalo sauce, and blue cheese dressing and mix well. To assemble the pizzas, top each muffin half evenly with the chicken mixture, and sprinkle evenly with the cheese. Bake until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
