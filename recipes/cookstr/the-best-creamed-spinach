In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat until almost shimmering. Add the shallots and garlic and sauté until soft but not colored, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and scallions and sauté 1 minute. Add the cream, raise the heat slightly, and boil until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the spinach and stir until wilted. Add the butter and continue to stir until the spinach is soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Variation: You can omit other ingredients if you want to, but keep the mushrooms and garlic!
