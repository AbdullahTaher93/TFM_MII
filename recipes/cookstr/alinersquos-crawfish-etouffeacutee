Make a medium-brown roux by heating the oil in a large saucepan over mediumhigh heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns the color of a fallen leaf. Add the butter, allowing it time to melt and mix in. Add the yellow onion and sauté until it’s barely brown around the edges. Add the green onions, bell pepper, and garlic, and cook until tender. Add the tomato and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then add the celery, parsley, basil leaf, and bay leaf. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add the crawfish tails, crawfish fat, Tabasco, and salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 10-12 minutes more. Remember as you add the salt and pepper that the boiled crawfish already have a good bit of both. Serve over rice, topped with finely chopped green onion for garnish.
