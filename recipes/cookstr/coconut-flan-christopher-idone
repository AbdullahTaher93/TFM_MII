In a heavy saucepan combine the sugar with 2 tablespoons cold water and let stand until moistened. Over medium heat, swirl the pan continuously until the sugar dissolves. When the syrup becomes a medium-dark amber color, pour the caramel into the bottom of a 2-quart shallow baking dish. Immediately lift the mold using dry kitchen towels (the mold will be hot), and turn and tilt it until the bottom and sides are coated with caramel. Set aside. Prepare the custard: Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Spread the coconut on a baking sheet. Bake, stirring once or twice until toasted and golden brown, about 5 to 10 minutes, Set aside. In a medium saucepan, bring the milk, sugar, and coconut to a simmer over medium heat, stirring often to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and steep for 20 minutes. Using an electric mixer set at high speed, beat together the whole eggs and egg yolks until thick and lemon colored, about 1 minute. Strain the coconut-milk mixture through a fine sieve pressing down to extract the milk from the coconut. Discard the coconut. Gradually beat into the egg mixture. Pour the custard into the caramelized dish. Place within a larger roasting pan and add enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the pan. Place on center rack of the oven and bake for about 50 minutes or until the custard is set, but wobbly when shaken. (A paring knife inserted in the center of the custard will come out clean but slightly wet.) Remove the custard from the water bath and cool for 20 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight. To serve, run the blade of a paring knife around the edges of the dish. Dip the dish in a roasting pan filled with hot water for a minute or two. Set a large deep serving platter that can hold the caramel sauce over the dish. Hold tightly, invert, and unmold.
