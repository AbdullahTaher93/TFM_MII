Combine all the wet fixin’s in a large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan and slowly bring to a boil, uncovered, over medium heat. Meanwhile, combine the dry fixin’s in a bowl and mix with your fingers. Reduce the heat and stir the dry fixin’s into the sauce mixture. Gently simmer the sauce until thick, concentrated, and richly flavored, about 30 minutes. Use right away or transfer to jars, cover, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for several weeks.
