Preheat the oven to 375°F. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, and fry half of your salami until quite crisp. Add the onion and garlic and cook slowly until the onion is soft. Add the balsamic vinegar, chopped tomatoes, crème fraîche and basil. Mix together, season to taste, and simmer for a few minutes. Cook the rigatoni until al dente. Drain, and drizzle over a little olive oil and seasoning. Tip into a baking dish, pour over the sauce and give everything a stir. Lay the mozzarella slices over the top with the rest of the salami. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes until golden.
