MAKE THE SCONES Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk until combined. Add the butter. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until the butter is pea-sized. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, ¾ cup of the buttermilk, and the maple extract. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and then gently knead the dough with your hands until the dough starts to come together. Add the walnuts to the dough and knead gently to incorporate. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface. Use your hands to shape the dough into two discs (about 1½ inches in height). Do not overwork the dough. Cut each disk into 6 wedges with a knife. Place the wedges onto the prepared baking sheet. Brush each scone with the remaining buttermilk and sprinkle with raw sugar. Bake in the center of the oven for about 25 to 30 minutes (rotating the baking sheet halfway through the baking time) or until the scones are golden brown. Transfer the scones to a cooling rack to cool completely.
