Heat the olive oil in a large heavy saucepan (preferably nonstick). Add the onion, garlic, celery, and carrot and cook over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the turkey and prosciutto and cook until the turkey is crumbly and nicely browned, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring and breaking up the meat with the edge of a wooden spoon. Add the tomato paste after 4 minutes. Add the madeira when the turkey is browned and bring to a boil. Stir in the chopped tomatoes with juices, vinegar, oregano, and salt and pepper and simmer the sauce until richly flavored, about 10 minutes. Stir in the basil or parsley and cook for 1 minute. Correct the seasoning, adding salt, pepper, or vinegar as needed. Refrigerated, this sauce will keep for 3 to 4 days.
