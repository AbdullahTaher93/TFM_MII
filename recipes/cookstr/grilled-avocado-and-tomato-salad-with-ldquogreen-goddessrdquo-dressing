Make the dressing: In a food processor, combine the avocados, basil, tarragon, parsley, garlic, and the ascorbic acid, if using. Process until very smooth. Add the lime juice, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and process until well mixed. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. If the dressing is very thick, add cold water as needed to create a pourable dressing. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until needed. Make the salad: Ready a charcoal or gas grill for direct heat grilling over a medium-hot fire. Core the tomatoes, quarter through the stem end, and arrange on a large platter; set aside. Place the avocado halves in a bowl and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the juice of 1 lemon. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss gently to coat evenly. Place each avocado half, flat side down, on the grill and grill until well caramelized, 30 to 45 seconds. Remove and place, flat side up, on top of the tomatoes. Do not grill on the second side. In another bowl, squeeze the juice from the remaining lemon over the onion slices and mix well. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss to coat evenly. Divide the onion slices evenly among the avocado halves, draping them over the hollows left by the pits. Spoon the lemon-olive oil mixture remaining in the bowl over the avocados and onion slices. Top with the dressing, distributing evenly and generously on all sides. Sprinkle with the cheese and pine nuts and serve at once.
