Prepare the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the vinegar and salt and whisk to dissolve the salt. Add the mustard, capers, and oil and whisk to blend. Taste for seasoning. Set aside. Bring 1 quart water to a simmer in the bottom of a steamer. Place the leeks on the steaming rack. Place the rack over the simmering water, cover, and steam until the leeks are soft and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Drain the leeks and transfer to a platter. Immediately cover with the vinaigrette while the leeks are warm, so they soak up the sauce. Sprinkle with chives or parsley and serve.
