Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat until it begins to simmer. Add the garlic and cook about 3 minutes. Discard the garlic. In batches, add the eggplant to the oil and fry, stirring often, for 3 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Discard all but 2 tbsp of the oil from the pan. Add the tomatoes and cook for 1â€“2 minutes, until slightly softened. Transfer to a bowl. Add the eggplant to the bowl and season well with salt and pepper. Add the basil and mix gently. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 1 hour to develop the flavors. Check the seasoning. Garnish with the basil and serve warm.
