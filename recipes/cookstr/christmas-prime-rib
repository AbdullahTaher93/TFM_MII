Allow the roast to stand at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes. Put the garlic, rosemary, basil, salt, and pepper in a food processor and pulse to finely mince. Add the mustard and olive oil and process to form a paste. Smear the paste all over the top and sides of the roast. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes. When the grill is hot, cut off the center or back burner and adjust the heat to medium. Put the roast on the grill, bone side down, close the lid, and cook to your desired doneness, 1½ to 2 hours for medium-rare (the meat will register 135°F to 140°F on an instant-read thermometer). Transfer the roast to a cutting board and remove the bones. Loosely cover the roast with foil and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes. The internal temperature will rise 5°F to 10°F. Carve the meat into slices and serve.
