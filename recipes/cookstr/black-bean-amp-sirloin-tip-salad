To prepare the beans: (Best if done a day ahead) First spread the dry beans out in a shallow roasting pan and pick through them carefully. You want to remove any small stones, bits of clay, or other non-food material. Put the beans in a sieve and rinse them under running water for 1 or 2 minutes. Place the rinsed beans in a medium bowl with enough water to cover them, and soak for a few hours or overnight. After soaking, drain, and rinse again. Place the beans in a pot with two quarts of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and then simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until tender. This should take about 90 minutes or less. Drain and refrigerate for later use. You should have about 2Â½ cups of cooked beans. To assemble the salad: In a large bowl, mix together the mustard, lemon juice, seasoning, olive oil, red onion, and scallions. Add the beans and toss to season well. Refrigerate for a least one hour. Grill sirloin tips to your preferred level of done ness. For this salad, we think medium rare is best. Slice into strips. Place a handful of field greens on each plate and top with a generous amount of the chilled black bean mixture. Lay a few strips of sliced sirloin over the beans and top the steak with chopped tomatoes.
