Slice the cabbage as finely as possible. Transfer to a large bowl and add the carrots, celery, and scallions. Mix well. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and milk, then the lemon juice, parsley, and chives. Pour over the vegetables and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Serve chilled.
