In a medium saucepan, bring the potatoes, onion, peppers, and 1 cup (250 ml) water to a boil. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the corn, scallions, celery, milk, and cream. Return to just under a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid scorching. Season with the salt, pepper, and hot red pepper sauce.
