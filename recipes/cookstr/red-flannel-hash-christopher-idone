In a large bowl, mix together the meat and all of the vegetables, except the beets. Lightly salt and pepper the mixture to taste. If the corned beef is very salty, do not add any salt. Over moderate heat, melt the butter in a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet. Fold the beets into the hash mixture and turn the mixture into the skillet. Pack firmly, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Uncover and drizzle the cream over the hash. Cover and continue cooking for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until crusty and well browned. Turn the hash over with a spatula and pack firmly again. Continue to cook for another 15 minutes.
