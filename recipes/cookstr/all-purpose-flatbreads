Pour the water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the yeast, oil, flour, and salt and stir with a rubber spatula just long enough to blend into a dough. With the dough hook, mix the dough on low speed (2, on a KitchenAid® mixer) for 1 minute. Turn the speed to medium (6 on a KitchenAid® mixer) and knead until it becomes cohessive, but is still very soft, about 6 minutes more. Scrape the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm and draft-free spot until it has increased in volume about 1½ times, about 1 hour. (Alternatively, pour the water into a large bowl. Add the yeast, oil, flour, and salt and stir with a rubber spatula just long enough to blend into a dough. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead it until it is a smooth but soft-not bouncy-ball, 4 to 7 minutes. Let rise as indicated in the previous step.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and cut it into 6 equal pieces. Sprinkle with flour and lightly drape the pieces with plastic wrap. Let stand for 30 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll one piece of the dough into a thin 9-inch round. Spray a large frying pan or pancake griddle with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium heat until hot, 2, to 3 minutes. Grill the rolled-out dough until blistered and lightly browned, turning once with tongs, 4 to 7 minutes total. Transfer the grilled bread to a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining breads .
