Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the pork and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, chipotles, and oregano, bring to a simmer, and let simmer until the pork is just cooked through (still slightly pink in the center) and the sauce has reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes. If desired, for warm tortillas, wrap them in a clean kitchen towel and warm them in the microwave for 30 seconds on HIGH. Arrange the pork on the tortillas, top with the cheese and other toppings as desired, and serve.
