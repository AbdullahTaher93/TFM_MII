Melt the butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook about 6 minutes, until lightly browned. Add the mussels, wine, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook shaking the pan often, for about 6 minutes, or until the mussels have opened. Transfer the mussels to large serving bowls, discarding any mussels that do not open. Cover the bowls with a large clean kitchen towel to keep the mussels warm. Strain the liquor through a fine sieve into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the parsley and adjust the seasoning. Pour the sauce over the mussels and serve immediately. Good with plenty of French bread for sopping up the juices. Serving mussels: Provide diners with additional bowls for the empty shells, finger bowls of warm water, and a slice of lemon. To serve as a starter, halve the recipe.
