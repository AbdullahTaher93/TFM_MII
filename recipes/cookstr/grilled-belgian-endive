Turn on the broiler. Discard any of the endiveâ€™s bruised or wilted outer leaves. Cut away a thin slice from the root end to remove the usually discolored surface portion of the stem. Wash the endive under cold running water, then shake off the moisture. Cut each head of endive in half lengthwise. Make a cut in the root end, cutting half as deep as the root is thick and running the cut from the bottom to where the leaves join the root. Place the endive cut side up on a broiling pan. Sprinkle liberally with salt and grindings of pepper and pour the olive oil over it in a thin stream. Insert the pan in the broiler at the level farthest away from the heat. After 10 minutes, turn the endive over and baste with the oil in the pan. After 7 or 8 minutes, turn the endive over once more so the cut side will again be facing up. Baste again with the oil from the pan, directing it, as much as possible, between one leaf and another, and adding fresh, raw oil if necessary. Bake for about 5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the endive. It is done when you can easily pierce the root end with a fork. Expect the tips of the leaves to be somewhat blackened. It is not only acceptable, but desirable. Serve hot or even lukewarm.
