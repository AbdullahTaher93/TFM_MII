Rinse and drain the beans. Place in a heavy saucepan, add enough cold water to cover by about 2 inches, and bring to a boil over high heat. Skim the foam from the surface, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring from time to time, until they are tender and easily break when pinched between 2 fingers, 1 to l½ hours. Heat the olive oil and 1 teaspoon white truffle oil in a very small sauté pan. Over medium heat, add the garlic and sauté until soft but not burned, about 4 minutes. Set aside. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid. Place the beans in a food processor with 2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid, the white truffle (if using), the remaining 1 tablespoon white truffle oil, the garlic with its oil, salt, and pepper and puree until a bit thicker than mashed potatoes. Set aside some cooking liquid to thin out the puree just before serving. (Covered, the puree will keep 3 days in the refrigerator. Bring the puree to room temperature. Adjust the consistency by adding cooking liquid. Spoon the puree onto toast, if desired, or onto a plate. Garnish with chopped fresh herbs.
