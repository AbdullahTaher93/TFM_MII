Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with nonstick spray. Place dates and flour in food processor. Pulse to combine, then process until dates are finely chopped. Scrape mixture into a large bowl. Add nuts to food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add date-flour mixture back to processor along with baking powder and salt and quickly pulse to break up sticky dates and create a uniform mixture. In a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed, beat eggs, granulated sugar, and vanilla together until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add about one third of date-flour mixture and mix on low speed. Gradually add remaining date-flour mixture, mixing just until blended. Scrape into baking pan, spreading evenly. Bake until an even light golden brown all over, about 40 minutes; toothpick inserted in center should come out clean. Place pan on rack to cool for 5 minutes. Cut into 36 bars (6 × 6) while still warm. Place confectioners’ sugar in a small bowl. Roll each square in it to coat completely while still warm, shaping the squares into rough barrel shapes as you go. Each cookie will be a unique, rustic shape. Place each cookie on rack to cool completely.
