Combine the rhubarb and strawberries in a large bowl. Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a small bowl. Pour over the fruit and toss until evenly coated. Sprinkle Crust Dust into the empty pie shell. Pour the rhubarb and strawberries into the crust, making sure to scrape out any dry ingredients that stick to the side of the bowl. Gently smooth the pie filling with a spatula. Finish the pie according to the double-crust instructions (p. 39), then freeze for at least 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Brush the top of pie with Pie Wash and sprinkle liberally with coarse-grained sugar. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, rotating 180 degrees every 20 minutes, until the crust is dark golden brown and the juices are bubbling thickly through the vents. Cool for at least 3 hours before slicing. The unbaked pie can be stored in the freezer for up to 1 week. The baked pie can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days and in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
