Preheat oven to 350°F. Rub the chicken breasts with the oil, then season both sides with a little salt and pepper. Place in a shallow baking pan and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until no longer pink in the center. Set chicken aside to cool. For curry sauce, in a small bowl combine the mustard, mayonnaise dressing, sour cream, honey, curry powder, vinegar, salt, cinnamon, and pepper. Set aside. Cut the chicken breasts into thin strips. In a medium bowl combine the chicken, cranberries, almonds, and scallions. Add the curry sauce to the chicken mixture and mix well. Place about ¾ cup of the chicken mixture on each tortilla, then top with some of the spinach. Roll up and halve crosswise.
