In the stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat and sauté the onions until soft, about 7 minutes. Add the carrots and sauté until they start to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat so the mixture doesn't scorch. Add the broth, coconut milk, and ginger and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the carrots are very soft. Puree with an immersion blender until silky smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Include one quarter of the almonds, bread, and crème fraîche. TO SERVE Reheat and garnish with toasted almonds, a dollop of crème fraîche, and a dusting of paprika, if desired. Serve the bread alongside.
