Make the pie crust dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Tossing the flour mixture with a fork, sprinkle in the ice water, mixing just until the dough is moist enough to hold together when pinched between your thumb and forefinger. (You may have to add more ice water.) Gather the dough up to form a thick flat disk, and wrap it in waxed paper. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. Meanwhile, make the filling: In a large saucepan of boiling water, cook the (unpeeled) sweet potatoes until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 25 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain again. Allow the sweet potatoes to cool slightly, then pare and mash them. You should have about 2 cups mashed sweet potatoes. Mix the mashed sweet potatoes with the sugar in a large bowl. Add the eggs and beat well. Beat in the cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Add the milk and beat well. Beat in the flour. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 8 hours. Make the praline topping: In a medium bowl, combine the pecans and brown sugar. Drizzle with the melted butter, and combine with your fingertips until moistened and crumbly. Set aside at room temperature. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to form a 14-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Transfer it to a 10-inch round pie plate. Fold over 1 inch of the excess dough, and flute the edges decoratively. Pour in the filling and spread it out evenly. Crumble the praline topping over the filling. Bake until the filling is set, about 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on a wire cake rack until warm, about 10 minutes. Serve warm, with scoops of vanilla ice cream.
