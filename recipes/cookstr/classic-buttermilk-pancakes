In a small, deep bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft, glossy peaks form, In another bowl, beat or whisk together the egg yolks, buttermilk, and butter. Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Fold in the egg whites. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat and grease lightly. For each pancake, spoon or pour about ¼ cup batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look dry, about 2 minutes.
