Bring a medium potful of lightly salted water to a boil, add the shrimp, and cook for 30 seconds. Drain and peel off the shells. Blanch the salmon in the same way and drain. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium pot, add all the cubed vegetables, and cook over medium-low heat for 1 minute, stirring. Add the dashi and cook, covered, until the vegetables are soft, about 15 minutes. Add the salmon and shrimp and cook for 3 minutes. Add the miso and toban jiang, whisking until it is dissolved. Serve equal portions of the soup in four soup bowls. Grind some black pepper over the top.
