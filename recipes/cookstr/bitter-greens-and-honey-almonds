Cook the diced bacon in a saute pan over medium-low heat until the fat has rendered and the bacon is crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside. Cover the greens with cold water in a pot and cook until tender, 20 minutes for mustard greens, 90 minutes for collard greens, 10 minutes for broccoli rabe, 10 minutes for escarole, and 15 minutes for beet greens. Drain the greens and set aside. In a wide, heavy-bottomed saute pan, heat the butter and add the almonds. Saute until they start to brown, 3 minutes. Pour in Â½ cup water, then the honey. Stir and cook until the water has evaporated and the honey has caramelized and coated the almonds, about 5 minutes. Before the almonds become too dry, add the cooked greens and bacon, season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing and stirring, to evenly distribute the almonds and bacon. Serve at once.
