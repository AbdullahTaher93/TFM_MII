1 Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. 2 Place the cauliflower in a large saucepan or a microwave-safe container and steam or microwave until just tender. Drain and transfer to a large, shallow casserole. 3 Melt the margarine in a small skillet. Drizzle half of it over the cauliflower and toss to mix. 4 Add the bread crumbs and wheat germ to the remaining margarine in the skillet and toss to coat. Remove from the heat. 5 Sprinkle the cheese, if using, over the cauliflower, then sprinkle the bread crumb mixture evenly over the top. Sprinkle on the scallions, if desired. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the bread crumbs look crisp and golden. Serve.
