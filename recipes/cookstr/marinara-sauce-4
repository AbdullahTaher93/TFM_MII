Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Add the onion and garlic, and saut√© for about 5 minutes, until the onion has softened, not browned. Lower the heat if the onion or garlic is browning. Add the wine and cook for 1 or 2 minutes to burn off the alcohol. Add the tomatoes and sugar, and lower the heat. Break the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon to help them break-down, but leave a few whole. Simmer the tomatoes for 30 minutes to 1 hour until the broken-up tomatoes have cooked down to the consistency of marinara sauce. Stir in the tomato paste and basil, and season with salt to taste.
