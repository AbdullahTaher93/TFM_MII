Preheat broiler, with rack placed 4 inches (10 cm) from heat. Brush both sides of baguette slices lightly with oil and place on baking sheet. Broil, turning once, until toasted on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Sprinkle with cheese and salt and pepper to taste. Broil until cheese is just melted, about 1 minute. Let cool slightly on sheet on a wire rack and use warm. Variation: Blue Cheese Croutons: Substitute 6 oz (175 g) blue cheese, crumbled, at room temperature, for the shredded cheese. We like Maytag, Gorgonzola or Saga.
