Stir together the ginger, soy sauce, rice wine, oil, lime juice, chile, and cilantro in a bowl. Pour half the marinade into a container; cover; and refrigerate. (This will be the dressing for the salad.) Put the chicken breasts in a shallow baking dish or other vessel. Pour the remaining marinade over the chicken, cover with plastic wrap, and let marinate, refrigerated, for 6 hours, or overnight. Preheat a grill or grill pan. Gently stir the tomatoes, radishes, and grapefruit together in a bowl. Set aside. Remove the chicken from the baking dish and discard the marinade. Grill the chicken breasts until the juices run clear when pierced with the tip of a knife or fork, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Set the chicken aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes. Add the chicken to the tomato salad and drizzle the dressing over the salad. (To prevent contaminating the food, do not under any circumstances use the marinade that dressed the raw chicken.) Toss gently. To serve, arrange a few slices of avocado in the center of each of 4 plates. Spoon some salad over each avocado base and scatter some scallions over each serving.
