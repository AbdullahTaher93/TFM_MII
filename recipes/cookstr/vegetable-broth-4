Peel potatoes and transfer peelings to a medium saucepan. (Potatoes can be cooked separately and reserved for another use.) Cover peelings with water (adjust quantity of water if necessary; peelings should be well covered). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Strain liquid through a sieve, discarding solids. Set aside. In large stockpot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and saute until softened and starting to brown. Add reserved potato-peel liquid, along with carrots, celery, zucchini, sweet potato and garlic. Pour in additional 8 cups (2 L) water, or whatever is necessary to cover vegetables by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Add parsley, thyme, salt and peppercorns. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Strain stock through a sieve lined with cheesecloth, discarding solids. Allow stock to cool, then refrigerate. Portion stock in 2 1/2- to 3-cup (625 to 750 mL) portions for use in fondues. Freeze if desired.
