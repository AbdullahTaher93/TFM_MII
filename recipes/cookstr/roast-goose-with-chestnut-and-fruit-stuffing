Prepare the goose for roasting. Roll the marinated prunes in the grated lemon rind, the apples in sugar and lemon juice, and the chestnuts in the grated orange rind. Stuff the bird with alternate layers of these three ingredients. Close the cavity with several thicknesses of foil or sew it up. Rub the goose with salt and pepper and prick the skin, place on a rack in a roasting pan, cover with foil, and roast at 375 degrees about 2Â¼ hours. Remove the foil, prick the skin of the goose very well, and return to the oven for 15 to 25 minutes or until the skin is crisped. Remove to a hot platter and serve surrounded by baked or candied sweet potatoes.
