Make the croutons: Heat the oven to 325°. Spread bread cubes in a sheet pan and bake for 10 minutes while preparing the seasoning. Melt the olive oil and butter in a small saucepan. Add the garlic, salt, oregano, basil, cayenne, and celery seed. Take the lightly toasted croutons from the oven (they should still be soft) and put them into a 2-quart bowl. Pour the seasoning oil over, turning and tossing to mix. Spread the croutons-again on the pan, return to the oven, and bake until crisp, but not hard, 10 to 15 minutes more. Cool on the pan, then transfer back to the bowl. Hold at room temperature until serving. Make the vinaigrette: Combine all in a 2-cup glass measure. Blend till smooth with a hand-held blender. Thin with a little water if needed. Makes about one cup. Make the croutons: Heat the oven to 325°. Spread bread cubes in a sheet pan and bake for 10 minutes while preparing the seasoning.
