Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and pepper and any of the optional flavorings (except the lemon juice), if using, and cook until the garlic pieces are translucent and fragrant, but not brown, 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the lemon juice. The baste can be made ahead of time, but itâ€™s so quick and easy to prepare, you might as well make it as you need it. If storing, transfer to a jar, cover, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. The baste will keep for several weeks. Reheat to melt the butter before using. VARIATIONS For a milder garlic flavor, peel the cloves and gently crush them with the side of a cleaver, but do not chop. Cook them in the butter until soft, fragrant, and just beginning to brown. For beurre noisette flavor, cook the butter over medium heat until it starts to brown. Add the garlic and continue cooking until the garlic is translucent and fragrant and the butter is golden brown. For a Mediterranean accent, prepare the baste with extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. For extra flavor, add a sprig of rosemary.
