In a saucepan, combine sugar, orange zest, orange juice and ginger. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Add cranberries and cook until they pop, about 5 minutes. Stir in pecans. Remove from heat and let cool. Variation: If you donâ€™t care for pecans, substitute raisins, currants or blueberries.
