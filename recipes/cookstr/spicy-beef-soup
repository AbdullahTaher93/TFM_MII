Place beef in a large stockpot and add about 16 cups (1 gallon) of water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for at least 1 hour. Remove the meat from the broth. Skim the fat and foam from the broth. Once the meat has cooled, shred it into thin strips. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the garlic, chili powder, soy sauce, and salt. Add the beef and mix thoroughly. Cover and let marinate for about 10 minutes. Combine the eggs and sesame oil in a small bowl and beat until well mixed. Bring the broth to a boil again. Add the seasoned meat, green onions, and black pepper. Bring to a boil again, then add the egg mix, drizzling it slowly over the boiling broth. Serve immediately with rice and banchan.
