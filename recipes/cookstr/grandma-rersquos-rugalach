Prepare the dough: Place cream cheese and butter in the mixer bowl. Attach the flat beater and mixer bowl to the mixer. Set to speed 4 and beat until smooth. Reduce speed to stir and mix in flour, in 3 additions, and salt. Divide dough into 8 disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour, until firm. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: In a medium saucepan, bring milk, butter and sugar to a boil over medium heat. Add walnuts and cook, stirring constantly, until thick, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add vanilla. Let cool. Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Using a fine-mesh sieve, sprinkle confectioner’s sugar over a work surface. As you work with each piece of dough, keep the rest refrigerated. Working with one disk at a time, lay dough on work surface and sprinkle with confectioner’s sugar. Roll into a 10-inch (25 cm) round and spread thinly with 1/3 cup (75 ml) filling. Using a pastry wheel or a sharp knife, cut dough into 8 wedges. Beginning at the large end of each wedge, roll towards the small pointed end. Repeat with remaining dough. Place cookies 2 inches (5 cm) apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake in middle of preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.
