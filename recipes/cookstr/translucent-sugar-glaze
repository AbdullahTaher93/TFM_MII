Pour the sugar into a triple sifter and sift into a 1-quart mixing bowl. Add the water and stir with a rubber spatula until blended and smooth. The consistency should be thin enough so that a transparent film will cover the baked good. Adjust the consistency by adding water if it is too thick or sugar if it is too thin. Use immediately.
