Trim any tough, dark green leaves from the fris√©e. Break the head into leaves, wash well, and spin dry. Separate the curly frizz from the thick stems and tear the frizz into bite-sized pieces. Combine with the shredded radicchio and set aside. In a blender, combine the shallots, oil, vinegars, honey, and pepper. Taste for seasoning and add pepper if needed. Toss the greens with a small amount of dressing and divide among 6 chilled plates. Top each salad with some apples, walnuts, cheese, and raisins. Drizzle with additional dressing and serve immediately. VARIATION: Scatter golden yellow and orange flower petals from unsprayed fall flowers, such as marigolds, calendula, or mums, over the finished salad just before serving.
