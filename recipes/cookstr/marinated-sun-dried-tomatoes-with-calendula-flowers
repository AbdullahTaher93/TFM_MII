Place the tomatoes and vinegar in a bowl. Stirring occasionally, marinate for two hours, or until the tomatoes absorb most of the vinegar and soften. Add the garlic, basil, and oregano. Toss in the calendula flowers whole, or gently remove the petals before adding them to the bowl along with the flower centers. Mix the ingredients well. Transfer the mixture to a clean pint jar, and add enough oil to cover. Store in the kitchen pantry, where it will keep for at least a year. For A Change: • Substitute garlic chive flowers or coarsely chopped garlic scapes for the garlic cloves. • Layer the ingredients directly in the jar, instead of mixing them in a bowl first. • Add 1 tablespoon fresh thyme to the mixture. • Omit the calendula flowers.
