Preheat the oven to its highest setting (475ºF). Mix the batter ingredients together and put to one side. I like the batter to go huge so the key thing is to have an appropriately sized baking pan, about 12 x 18 inches – the thinner the better as we need to get the oil smoking hot. Pour ½ inch of the sunflower oil into the baking pan, then place this on the middle shelf of your oven. Place a larger tray underneath to catch any oil that overflows from the pan while cooking. When the oil is very hot, add your sausages. Keep your eyes on them and allow them to cook until lightly golden. At this point, take the pan out of the oven and, being very careful, pour your batter over the sausages. Throw the sprigs of rosemary into the batter. The batter will bubble and possibly even spit a little, so very carefully put the pan back into the oven and close the door. Don’t open the oven door for at least 20 minutes. Remove from the oven when golden and crisp. For the onion gravy, simply fry your onions and garlic in the butter over a medium heat for about 5 minutes until they go sweet and translucent; you could add a little thyme or rosemary if you like. Add the balsamic vinegar and allow it to cook down by half at this point. Sprinkle in the granules, add a little water and allow to simmer until you have a really tasty onion gravy.
