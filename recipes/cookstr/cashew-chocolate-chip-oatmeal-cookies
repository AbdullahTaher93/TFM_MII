Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Process the cashews in a food processor until they are crushed. With the power still on, dribble in the nondairy milk to help soften the cashews. (They will lump together and become pastelike.) In a large bowl, combine the cashew mixture with all the remaining ingredients, stirring well. Gauge the consistency and taste to see if you want more or less chocolate, oats, or sugar. Spoon the mixture into small rounds on the prepared cookie sheet and slightly flatten them into discs (the batter will be sticky). Bake the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove them, let them cool, and then serve. (These cookies do not spread like regular cookies. Look for a slightly browned top to know that they are done. They will firm up once they are cool.)
