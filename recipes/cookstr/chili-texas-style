In a small saucepan of simmering water, cook the jalapeñnos just until tender when pierced with the tip of a small knife, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. Cut open the jalapeños, remove the seeds, and chop fine. Scrape the chiles into a small bowl and set aside. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the ground round and cubed chuck, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the meat loses its pink color, about 6 minutes. Add the onions, garlic, and half the chopped jalapenos. Cook, stirring often, until the onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chili powder and cumin seeds and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the beef broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and cook until slightly thickened, about 45 minutes. Gradually stir in the shredded cheese. Taste, and season with additional chopped jalapenos, salt, and red pepper flakes, if desired. Serve with hot cooked rice or kidney beans on the side.
