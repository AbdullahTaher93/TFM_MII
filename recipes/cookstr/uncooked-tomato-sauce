Cut out the tough area around the core of each tomato and cut the tomatoes into quarters lengthwise. Using your fingers, push out the excess seeds. Chop the tomatoes coarsely or cut them into fine dice. Place the tomatoes in the bowl in which you will serve the pasta. Add the oil, basil, salt, and pepper to the tomatoes and stir to mix well. Allow the sauce to stand at room temperature while the pasta cooks. VARIATION WITH MARJORAM OR OREGANO: Use 1½ tablespoons fresh marjoram leaves or oregano leaves in place of the basil. VARIATION WITH OLIVES: Add ¼ to 1/3 cup Niçoise, Gaeta, or other sharply flavored imported black olives, pitted and sliced. Do not use the bland canned variety.
