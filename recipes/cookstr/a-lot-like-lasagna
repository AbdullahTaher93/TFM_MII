Trim a thin slice from one side of each zucchini, so it will lie flat on the cutting board. Cut the zucchini lengthwise to make ¼-inch slices and lay half the slices in a colander in the sink. Sprinkle well with kosher salt, then add the remaining slices and salt them as well. Let the zucchini sit 20 minutes to drain. Meanwhile, sauté the sausage until it’s browned, then drain on paper towels. Mix the sausage with the marinara sauce and set aside. Mix the ricotta with the egg, the spinach, and the pesto and set aside. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Rub a baking sheet with a little of the olive oil. When the zucchini slices have drained, rinse them and pat dry, then arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheet—you may need more than one sheet, or do them in batches if you must. Paint the tops of the zucchini slices with olive oil and bake 10 minutes, or until they start to turn golden brown. Turn them and bake until the other side is turning brown, just a few minutes. Spoon half the tomato-sausage mixture into an 8 x 8-inch baking dish. Arrange half the zucchini slices on top and then add the ricotta mixture, using a spatula to spread it evenly over the zucchini. Add the remaining zucchini in a layer, then the rest of the tomato-sausage mixture. Scatter the mozzarella evenly over the top and arrange the basil leaves, if you’re using them, over the whole thing. Bake at 350°F 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let sit 5 minutes to settle before slicing and serving.
