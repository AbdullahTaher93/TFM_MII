In a medium saucepan, bring the carrot juice to a boil over high heat and reduce to 2 to 3 tablespoons, about 10 to 12 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve into a small bowl. Add the salt, and cool to room temperature. When cool, gradually whisk in the oil until emulsified and season with the pepper.
