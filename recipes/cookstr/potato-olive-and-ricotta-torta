Preheat the oven to 375Â°F degrees. Oil a gratin dish just large enough to hold the ingredients, about 3 inches deep. Heat the olive oil with the herbs in a saucepan over low heat until fragrant. Add the potatoes and stir to coat with the oil for 1 to 2 minutes. Mash the mixture and let cool. Mix the eggs and ricotta until well combined. Add the potatoes, olives, and pecorino and stir. Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish. Dot with butter and sprinkle bread crumbs on top. Bake the torta for 45 minutes, or until firm and light golden. Serve warm or at room temperature.
