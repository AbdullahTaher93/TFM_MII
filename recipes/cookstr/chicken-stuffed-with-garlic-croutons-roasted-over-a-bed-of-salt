Preferably a day or two before roasting, rinse the chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Remove and discard any large chunks of fat. Reserve the giblets and neck for some other purpose. Liberally season the chicken with about 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt. Place the chicken on a cake rack or V-rack over paper towels and refrigerate, uncovered, for up to 2 days. About 2 hours before you plan to serve, take the chicken on the rack from the refrigerator. Make a bed of kosher salt in a shallow conventional roasting pan. Set a lightly oiled cake rack on top and place in the oven. Set the temperature at 500°F. Slip your fingers under the skin of the thighs and breasts and gently separate from the meat to create an air pocket without tearing the skin. Combine ½ teaspoon sea salt with the pepper and duck fat. Insert this mixture into the pockets under the skin of the chicken breast and rub into the flesh. Let the chicken come to room temperature. Meanwhile, prepare the stuffing. Tear the bread into small pieces; mix with the chopped garlic. Slip the garlic and bread into the cavity of the chicken. Sew up the opening, but do not tie the legs together. Gently press down on the breasts with the heels of your hands to flatten it a little. Fold the wings under the chicken. Pat the skin dry with paper towels. Do not apply any fat to the skin. About 1 hour before serving, slide the chicken, breast side down, onto the heated rack and roast for 20 minutes. Turn the chicken over and continue to roast until the chicken is golden brown and crisp and the internal temperature reaches 165°F, 20 to 25 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to a carving board and let rest for 10 minutes. Then scoop out the stuffing, carve the chicken, and arrange both on a platter. Drizzle any juices from the cavity of the chicken over the meat. Serve at once.
