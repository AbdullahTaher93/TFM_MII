With a sharp knife, thinly slice the fish. Spread the sliced onion evenly in the bottom of a shallow nonreactive dish. Pour the lime juice over the onion, then sprinkle it with the oil, paprika, and chile. Layer the fish on top, turning the slices to coat with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the cilantro and serve chilled.
