Preheat the oven to 450° F. In a mixing bowl, sift together the dry ingredients. Using your fingers, cut in the shortening until the mixture is coarse and crumbly. Add the milk and mix slightly. Fold in the ham. On a floured surface, roll or pat out the dough about ½-inch thick. Cut out biscuits with a cookie cutter and bake on an ungreased baking sheet for about 12 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.
