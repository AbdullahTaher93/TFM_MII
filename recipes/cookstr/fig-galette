Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt in a mixing bowl, until well combined. Add the butter and, with your fingers, gently work the butter and flour together until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add 5 tablespoons of the ice water and continue working the dough until it begins to come together. Add more water, a half a tablespoon at a time if needed. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a small disk. Gently flatten the disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 4 days (or freeze for up to 1 month). Remove one disk from the refrigerator and let it soften for 10 minutes. Unwrap it and on a lightly floured surface, roll it out into a 12-inch round. Place an 11-inch plate over the dough and trim off the edges of the pastry with a small knife. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Make the filling and assemble the tart: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the galette dough from the refrigerator. Starting at the center of the pastry, place the fig halves cut side up in concentric circles, leaving a 1-inch border free of fruit. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar over the figs. Cut 2 tablespoons of the butter into little pieces and scatter over the figs. Rotating the galette, fold the dough border over itself, crimping and pushing it up against the outer circle of fruit. Sprinkle the lavender evenly over the figs. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and brush the crust with the melted butter. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar over the melted butter. Place the tart in the oven and bake until the edges are golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and dust with confectionersâ€™ sugar. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
