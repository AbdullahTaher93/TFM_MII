Steam the cabbage in a large pot with a steamer rack until the first few layers of leaves are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pot and allow to cool. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the raisins, parsley, sugar, allspice, and cinnamon, season with cayenne, salt, and black pepper, and mix well. Remove from the heat, stir in the rice and lemon juice, and mix well. Remove as many of the cabbage leaves that are soft and lay them out on flat surface, rib side down. Place about 1/3 cup of the stuffing mixture on each leaf. Roll up each leaf around the stuffing, tucking in the sides as you roll. Repeat the process until the mixture is used up, steaming more cabbage leaves to soften as necessary. Place the filled cabbage rolls in a 5Â½- to 6-quart slow cooker, seam side down. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, the water, and apple juice. Cover and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours, until the cabbage is tender. Serve hot.
