Combine the walnuts and oil in a 3Â½- to 4-quart slow cooker, stirring to coat. Add the brown sugar, stirring to coat evenly. Cover and cook on High for 15 minutes. Adjust the setting to Low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the nuts are coated with a crisp glaze, about 2 hours. In a small bowl, combine the ginger, cinnamon, and allspice and sprinkle over the nuts, stirring to coat evenly. Spread the nuts out in a single layer on a baking sheet and let cool completely before serving. These nuts will keep in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to a month or in the freezer for 2 to 3 months.
