Scrub the vegetables and chop them roughly into 1 inch chunks. Heat the oil in a soup pot. Add the vegetables and herbs and cook over high heat 5 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently. The more color they get, the richer the flavor of the stock. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes. Strain.
