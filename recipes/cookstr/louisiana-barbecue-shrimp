Combine the shrimp and 1 tablespoon of the Creole seasoning in a bowl, and toss to coat. Allow the shrimp to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add the oil, and when hot, add the rosemary and garlic, and saut√© until the garlic is lightly browned, being careful not to let it burn. Add the shrimp and stir carefully, cooking until just done. Remove and keep warm. Add the beer to the skillet, raise the heat, and deglaze the pan, being sure to scrape up any bits and pieces from the pan. Add the lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, thyme, oregano, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat, and simmer the sauce to reduce and thicken. Return the shrimp to the sauce, and stir in the butter. To serve, mound the rice in the bottom of individual bowls, top with the shrimp, garnish with the parsley, and serve with a slice of bread.
