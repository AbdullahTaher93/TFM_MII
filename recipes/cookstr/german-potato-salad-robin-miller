Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and pour over enough water to cover. Set the pan over high heat, bring to a boil, and let boil until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and, while still warm, transfer to a large bowl. Add the scallions, bacon, vinegar, and oil and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or chilled. .
