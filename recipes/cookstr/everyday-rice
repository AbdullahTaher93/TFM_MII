Measure the rice into a medium saucepan and add cold water to cover the grains. Swirl the grains with your hand, drain well, and then add the measured 2 cups of water. Bring to a gentle boil, uncovered, over medium heat. Let the rice continue to boil gently until the water level drops below the level of the rice so that it looks dry. Stir well, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes, remove from the heat, and then let stand, covered, for 10 minutes more. Fluff gently with a fork and serve hot or warm.
