Salt the eggplant liberally and put in colander to drain for 1 hour. Toss the tomatoes with ½ cup of the olive oil, salt and pepper to taste, and the 5 torn basil leaves. Set aside. Dry the eggplant with paper towels and in a bowl toss with the flour. Pour enough canola or peanut oil into a large skillet to come halfway up the sides of the pan. Heat to 375°F. on a candy thermometer. Add the eggplant and fry until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well on paper towels. Set aside. Discard the oil and wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel. Coat the bottom of the skillet with ¼ cup of the remaining olive oil. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and sauté until the garlic begins to color. Add the tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of the chopped basil, and the oregano and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the fried eggplant and season with a pinch of salt. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the gemelli or penne. Cook until the pasta is just under al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the sauce with ½ cup of the reserved cooking water. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, adding more of the pasta water if the mixture is dry. Stir in the remaining basil, the parsley, mozzarella, and Parmesan. When the mozzarella starts to melt, add 3 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil and stir until the cheese melts into the sauce. Serve immediately.
