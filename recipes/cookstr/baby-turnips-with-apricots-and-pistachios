Put the turnips in a pot and add just enough water to cover by Â¼ inch. Add I tablespoon of the butter and the sugar, season with salt and pepper, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat so the liquid is just simmering and continue to simmer until the turnips are just tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the apricots and warm them for 1 minute. Add the turnip greens, stir, and let wilt for 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the turnips, apricots, and greens to a large warmed serving bowl and set them aside to keep warm. Return the pot to the stove and bring the cooking liquid to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil until reduced by one-third to concentrate the flavors, 2 to 3 minutes. (There should be only a few tablespoons of liquid left.) Remove the pot from the heat and whisk or swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the reduction over the turnips, apricots, and greens, sprinkle with the pistachios, and serve. VARIATION Medjool dates, pitted and cut into slivers, are a sweet substitute for the apricots.
