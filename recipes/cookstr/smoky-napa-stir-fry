Cut the cabbage crosswise into 1/4-inch slices, then slice them crosswise to make bite-sized pieces (you should have 4 loosely packed cups). Place in a bowl of cold water to wash thoroughly, then lift out, drain, and set aside. Pour the hot water into a small bowl, add the oyster sauce, and stir well. Set aside. Place a medium or large wok or large deep skillet over high heat. Add the oil, then lower the heat to medium-high and stir in the turmeric. Add the chiles, shallot, and ginger and stir-fry for about 30 seconds, until the shallot starts to soften. Raise the heat to high, toss in the chopped greens and salt, and stir-fry, tossing and pressing the greens against the hot sides of the pan. When they have wilted and softened, 2 to 3 minutes, add the oyster sauce mixture. Bring to a boil, turn and stir for another 15 seconds or so to distribute flavors and finish cooking the greens, and turn out into a wide shallow bowl. Serve hot or at room temperature.
