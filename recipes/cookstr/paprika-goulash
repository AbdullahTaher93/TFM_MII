1 Put the cornstarch and beef into a plastic Ziploc, seal the top, and shake well until all the beef pieces are lightly dusted. 2 Heat the sunflower oil in a heavy pot, add the bacon, garlic, onions, caraway, and paprika, and cook for 3 minutes. 3 Add the beef to the pot, followed by the stock and tomato paste. Season with black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook very gently for 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the sauce is reduced to a rich consistency. 4 Serve with a generous topping of yogurt sprinkled with paprika.
