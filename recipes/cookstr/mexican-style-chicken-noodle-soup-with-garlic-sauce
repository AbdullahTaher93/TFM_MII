Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, garlic, and onion and sauté for 10 minutes, or until the onion is soft and translucent. Pour the broth over the vegetables and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large skillet. Add the noodles and toast over medium-high heat, 5 to 8 minutes, or until light brown. Watch carefully so the noodles don’t burn. This can be done in two batches. Place the noodles in a heavy saucepan. Strain the broth and pour ½ cup over the noodles. Cook 10 minutes, until the noodles are soft and plump. Add the remaining soup and cook another 5 minutes, or until soup is hot and thick. Ladle into bowls and top with cilantro, chiles, and a dollop of Garlic Sauce. Serve immediately. For the Garlic Sauce: Place the garlic, salt, egg yolks, and lemon juice in a blender. Blend on high speed until mixture is smooth, then slowly add the oil in a very thin stream until it is absorbed and forms an emulsion. Adjust salt to taste. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Makes ½ cup
