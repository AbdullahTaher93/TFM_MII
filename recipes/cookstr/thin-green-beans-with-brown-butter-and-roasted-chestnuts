Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the beans and simmer for 5 minutes, or until almost tender. Drain and place under cold running water to stop the cooking; drain again. In a medium skillet, heat the butter over medium heat for about 4 minutes, until it sizzles and just begins to turn a rich brown. Remove from the heat and add the chestnut slices, and salt and pepper to taste, and cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Toss the brown butter and chestnuts with the green beans to thoroughly coat them all. Serve Immediately or place in a small casserole or shallow ovenproof dish, cover with foil, and refrigerate until ready to serve. Reheat the beans, covered, in a 350 degree F oven for about 15 minutes, or until hot. Variations: Substitute ¾ cup chopped or sliced nuts for the chestnuts. Add ½ teaspoon grated lemon zest to the beans. Add 1/3 cup cooked chopped bacon or pancetta to the beans. Substitute 3 tablespoons of olive oil for the butter for a lighter version of the dish.
