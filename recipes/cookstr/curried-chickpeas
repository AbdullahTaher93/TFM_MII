Put the chickpeas, onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, green chiles, cumin, coriander, garam masala, chana masala, red chile powder, salt, turmeric, and water in the slow cooker. Cook on high for 14 hours. Toward the end of cooking time, use the back of a large spoon to mash some of the beans against the walls of the slow cooker or pulse 2 or 3 times with an immersion blender. Add the cilantro. To serve, sprinkle sliced onions on top and eat with a lime wedge on the side accompanied by roti or naan, or in a bowl over basmati or brown rice. Try This! Toast a hamburger bun. Place a slice of cheese (any kind) on each half of the bun and heap on a spoonful of chana and fresh, diced onions. Itâ€™s a fast and healthy veggie alternative to the open-faced sandwich. My kids love this as a snack. For them, I like to use mini whole-wheat dinner rolls.
