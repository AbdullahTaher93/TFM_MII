Put the soaked beans in a medium saucepan, with enough water to cover them completely. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, or until the beans are soft but not mushy. Drain and transfer to a medium mixing bowl. Rinse the beans with cool water in a strainer and drain again. To make the dressing, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, Aleppo pepper, salt, and parsley in a small mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. Pour over the beans and toss. Garnish the beans with the eggs or scallions.
