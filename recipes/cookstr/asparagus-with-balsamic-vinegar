Preheat oven or toaster oven to 400 degrees F. Cut about ½ inch off the ends of the asparagus. This part of the vegetable is very tough and sometimes hard to chew. Another option is to bend the spears so that they snap above the tough part. Lay the asparagus spears along the bottom of a glass baking dish or the toaster oven tray. It’s okay if they overlap. Sprinkle the vinegar and olive oil on top, followed by the salt and pepper. Place in the oven for about 10 minutes. Check the asparagus about halfway into cooking and see if you can easily poke a fork through one of the spears. If you can, they are done. If not, cook for another 5 minutes.
