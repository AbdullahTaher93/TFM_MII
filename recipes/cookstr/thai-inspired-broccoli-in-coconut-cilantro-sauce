Cut the broccoli florets from the stalks, and separate them into small pieces. Trim the stalks, and use a paring knife or peeler to remove the fibrous outer layers. Cut the stalks into ½-inch chunks, set the florets and stalks aside. With the motor of the food processor running, pop the garlic and then the ginger, shallot, and jalapeno(s) into the feed tube, and chop finely. Reserve ½ cup tightly packed cilantro leaves. Chop the remaining cilantro a few times, add to the processor, and chop finely. Add the coconut milk, sugar, and salt, and process to blend thoroughly. Transfer the coconut milk mixture to a 4- or 5-quart pot, and bring to a boil. Boil gently, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the seitan from its tub. Reserve any marinating liquid if you like its taste, and add enough water to equal a total of 1 cup liquid. Stir this liquid (or 1 cup plain water) into the coconut milk mixture. Chop the seitan finely in the processor, and add it to the pot along with the reserved broccoli. Cover and cook at a moderate boil for 2 minutes. Add the bell peppers, cover, and continue cooking, stirring once or twice, until the broccoli is tender but still bright green, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Add more water during this time if the mixture becomes dry. Just before serving, coarsely chop the reserved cilantro leaves and stir them in. Add enough soy sauce to create a good balance of flavors. Ladle into soup bowls, and garnish with basil, if you wish. Accompany each portion with a few lime wedges. Other Ideas: Toss with cooked rice noodles, season with additional soy sauce and garnish with chopped roasted peanuts and bean sprouts. Substitute Smart Ground for the seitan. Smart Ground, crumbles made of soy protein concentrate and wheat gluten, is available in health-food stores and some supermarkets.
