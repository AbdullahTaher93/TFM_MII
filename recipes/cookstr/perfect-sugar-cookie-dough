In the bowl of an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat the butter until creamy and light, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the sugar and beat well. Add the eggs one at a time and beat well. Beat in the vanilla. Sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda. Add it in 2 batches to the creamed mixture, beating for about 30 seconds each time. The dough should be firm and cohesive, but not sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 1 hour. If you plan to make several different kinds of cookies with this dough, form into several balls, wrap each in plastic, and refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Drop the dough, using 1 heaping teaspoon per cookie, onto ungreased baking sheets. Sprinkle with a little granulated sugar. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months.
