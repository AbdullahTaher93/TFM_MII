Run the lentils through your hands to make sure there are no stones or other foreign bodies in them. Rinse them in two changes of water and put into a pan. Add onion, salt to taste, and enough water to come about 2 inches (5 cm) above the surface of the lentils. Set over medium heat and bring to a fast simmer. Continue simmering until the lentils are quite soft-about 1Â½ hours, depending on their age. Keep a pan of near-boiling water on the side, ready to add if necessary. Put the pork pieces into a pan; add salt to taste and water to cover. Bring to a fast simmer and continue simmering until the pork is tender but not soft-about 25 minutes. Strain, reserving the broth, and set broth and meat aside. Cover the dried chiles with hot water and leave to soak for about 15 minutes, until the chiles have softened and become fleshy. Drain and put into a blender jar with 1 cup (250 ml) of the reserved pork broth, the broiled tomatoes, garlic, oregano, clove, and cinnamon; blend until smooth, adding more broth only if needed to release the blades of the blender. Heat the lard in a small frying pan, add the blended ingredients, and fry over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until reduced and well seasoned--about 4 minutes. Add to the lentils and add the pork, remaining broth, plantain, and pineapple; simmer together for about 30 minutes. Adjust salt and add water if necessary. The mixture should be like a thick soup.
