For the Lemon Vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, whisk ¼ teaspoon salt with the lemon juice until dissolved. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Taste, and season with pepper and a little more salt, if needed. Add more lemon juice if the dressing tastes too flat. Makes 1 1/2 cups. Blanch the asparagus in a large pot of boiling salted water until bright green and still crisp, 3 to 4 minutes, and shock in a bowl of ice water. Remove it by grasping the stems, rather than the tips, with tongs. Repeat the blanching, shocking, and draining for the haricots verts, using a colander to drain. In a medium bowl, toss the asparagus, haricots verts, arugula, fennel, and cabbage with the lemon confit and enough lemon vinaigrette to dress lightly. Season to taste with salt. To serve, divide the salad among chilled plates and top with the sliced cheese. Grind a little coarse black pepper over each salad. Variations: For a main-course salad, top each serving with a portion of sautéed or grilled fish or chicken. If you don’t want to use both asparagus and beans, use a double quantity of either one. Or add some zucchini or shredded carrots. The amounts and vegetables are very flexible.
