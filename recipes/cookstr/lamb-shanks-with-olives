Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Liberally season the lamb shanks allover with salt and pepper. In a large, heavy enameled cast-iron or other nonreactive pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches to prevent crowding, add the lamb shanks and cook, turning them as needed, until browned allover, about 10 minutes. Using tongs, remove the shanks from the pot and set aside. Add the onions and garlic to the oil remaining in the pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, wine, and bay leaves, raise the heat to high, and boil until the liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes. Return the lamb shanks to the pot and add the olives. Cover, place in the oven, and cook until the lamb is nearly falling off the bones, 2 to 3 hours. Remove the bay leaves, then taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. Transfer to a warmed serving platter or individual plates. Garnish with the parsley and serve.
