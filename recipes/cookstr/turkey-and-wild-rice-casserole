Wash the rice thoroughly and cover with boiling water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain well. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Sauté the mushrooms and onion in 3 tablespoons butter for 10 minutes. Place in a buttered ovenproof casserole, along with the rice, turkey, almonds, and salt and pepper. Add the broth and cream; mix lightly. Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 1½ hours. Remove the cover, sprinkle with the cheese, and dot with the remaining butter. Increase the heat to 450°F and bake for 5 minutes longer.
