Cook the butter with the sugars: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the butter, light brown sugar, white sugar, corn syrup, and 1 tablespoon of water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool until it is slightly warm to the touch. Finish the sauce with the cream and alcohol: Add the cream, 2 tablespoons at a time, whisking after each addition. Once you have added all of the cream, whisk in the alcohol of choice. Remove from the heat and serve warm or transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until using. Serving Suggestions: Serve this sauce warm. Reheat the sauce directly over the stove, stirring with a rubber spatula, or place the container of sauce in a bowl of hot water. It matches up well with the Date Cake with Toffee Sauce.
