In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add onion and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until softened. Add red pepper, curry powder and ginger and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add broccoli, cauliflower, vegetable stock and carrots and cook, stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes or until heated through. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until vegetables are soft. Stir in chickpeas and tofu. Increase heat to medium and cook until the mixture begins to bubble. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until flavors are blended. Stir in soy milk, coconut, sugar and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Variations: For a slightly deeper flavor, add 1/2 tsp (2 mL) turmeric along with the ginger. If you like a bit of heat, add 3 or 4 drops of hot sesame oil. Sprinkle the tops of each portion with 2 tbsp (25 mL) finely chopped peanuts.
