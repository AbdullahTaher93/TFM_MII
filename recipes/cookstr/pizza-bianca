Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly oil 2 large baking sheets. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each on a very lightly floured work surface into an 8in (20cm) round. Arrange 2 rounds on each sheet. Brush with 2 tbsp of the oil and sprinkle with the Gorgonzola. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the dough is just beginning to brown. Remove from the oven, top with the prosciutto, figs, and tomatoes, and continue baking about 6 minutes, or until the pizzas are golden brown. Divide the arugula over each pizza and grind a generous amount of pepper on top. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and serve at once.
