Scald the heavy cream in a small saucepan. Off the heat, add the chocolate and stir until the chocolate melts. Divide this mixture among four large (12-ounce) mugs. Heat the milk until small bubbles appear around the edges and a skin starts to form on top. Remove the skin and pour the milk into the mugs. Stir the hot chocolate and serve immediately with a dab of whipped cream, marshmallows, or marshmallow topping.
