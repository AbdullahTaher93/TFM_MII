1. Rinse the livers and pat dry with paper towels. Trim away any sinew or greenish portions from the livers with kitchen scissors, then cut each in half. Melt 4 tbsp butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the livers and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 4 minutes, or until browned. Add the wine, chives, and thyme to the pan. Bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced by about half and the livers are just cooked through when sliced open. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes. Transfer the contents of the pan to a food processor. Process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon the pâtè into a serving bowl, pressing it down with the back of the spoon after each addition so that it is firmly packed. Melt the remaining butter over medium heat. Pour it over the top of the pate. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 2 hours. Garnish with sprigs of fresh thyme and serve. Good with plenty of toasted French breach slices and small sour pickles (cornichons).
