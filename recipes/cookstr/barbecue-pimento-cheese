Mix together all the spices in a small bowl until thoroughly blended. Grate the cheeses together into a large bowl and toss together to combine. Add the scallions and toss again; I find my clean, dry hands the best tool for doing this. Mix the mayonnaise with 2 tablespoons of the spice mix in a small bowl and stir until completely incorporated. Stir the mayonnaise into the cheese mixture until everything is well blended and all the cheese is coated. Stir in the pimentos until they are evenly distributed throughout. Chill the pimento cheese, covered, in the fridge for at least 2 hours to let the flavors meld. The pimento cheese will keep, refrigerated, for up to 1 week.
