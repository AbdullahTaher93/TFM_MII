Preheat the oven to 350° F. Working in batches, dip the bread in ¼ pound of the melted butter and brown lightly in a heavy skillet set over moderate heat. Line the bottom and sides of the soufflé dish with bread, cutting as necessary to fit the dish. Reserve the remaining slices of bread. Add the remaining ¼ pound butter to the skillet and return it to moderate heat. In a bowl, toss the apples with sugar and spices and turn the mixture into the skillet. Cook, stirring, until the apples wilt and the sugar melts. The filling will resemble a chunky sauce. Pour the filling into the lined dish and top with the reserved slices of bread. Place the mold in a hot water bath and bake for 30 to 50 minutes, until crisp and golden. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Place a serving dish over the mold and invert to unmold. Serve warm with heavy cream or whipped cream.
