Trim off the root end of the Brussels sprouts, and discard any browned or damaged outer leaves. Cut the Brussels sprouts lengthwise into ¼-inch slices, set aside. Begin bringing a large pot of water to the boil for the udon. In a large skillet, heat the oil. Add the ginger and garlic, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, for about 20 seconds. Add the sliced white part of the scallions, bell peppers, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Standing back to avoid spattering oil, add the water. Add the Brussels sprouts, cover, and cook over medium-high heat until the sprouts are tender-crisp and still bright green, 2 to 4 minutes. (Add a few tablespoons additional water during this time if the mixture becomes dry.) Set the skillet aside, uncovered. Break the udon in half and add them to the boiling water. In a small bowl, dissolve the miso in ½ cup of the noodle cooking water. Stir in the rosemary-infused oil and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. When the noodles are just short of done, drain them. Set them in the skillet with the Brussels sprouts, and stir in the miso sauce and reserved scallion greens. Add more soy sauce and rosemary oil, if needed. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until the mixture is good and hot. Toss in the pecans and serve immediately.
