Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Spread the oats in a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Let cool. In a large bowl, beat the eggs, brown sugar, and oil together until blended and stir in the buttermilk or yogurt, molasses, and vanilla. In a medium bowl, combine the flours, toasted oats, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon. Stir to blend. Add the dry ingredients to the buttermilk mixture and beat for about 1 minute, or until smooth. Stir in the cranberries. Spread evenly in the prepared pan. Toss the nuts and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon together and sprinkle evenly over the top. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack. Serve warm, cut into squares or strips.
