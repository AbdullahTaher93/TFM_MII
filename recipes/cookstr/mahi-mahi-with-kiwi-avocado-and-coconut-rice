Pat dry the mahi mahi with a paper towel and sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a small skillet or saucepan fitted with a lid, combine the coconut water, rice, and ¼ teaspoon of salt over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then decrease the heat until the liquid is barely bubbling. Place the mahi mahi fillet on top of the rice, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes, or until all the coconut water is absorbed. Turn off the heat and let the rice and fish stand, covered, for another 5 minutes. While the rice and fish are cooking, make the salsa. In a small bowl, stir together the kiwi, avocado, scallion, jalapeno, lime juice, and cilantro. Taste and add a touch of salt if necessary and a drizzle of honey if it’s too tart. Transfer the rice and fish to a plate, top with the salsa, and eat.
