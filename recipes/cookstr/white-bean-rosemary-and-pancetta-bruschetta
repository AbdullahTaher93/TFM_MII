Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and saut√© until crispy and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel. Place cooked pancetta, beans, olive oil, rosemary and garlic in the mixer bowl. Attach the flat beater and mixer bowl to the mixer. Set to speed 2 and mix until beans begin to break up. Increase to speed 4 and mix until beans are crushed and slightly creamy, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Brush both sides of baguette slices with extra-virgin olive oil and place on baking sheet in a single layer. Place under broiler and lightly brown on one side. Spread white bean mixture on the toasted side of the baguette slices. Drizzle a little more extra-virgin olive oil on top of each slice. Serve immediately.
