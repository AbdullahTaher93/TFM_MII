Mix the flour, yeast, and 1 tsp of the salt in a large bowl. Add the tepid water and stir to make a soft dough. Knead on a lightly floured work surface for 8–10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into four equal portions. Roll each into a 12in (30cm) rope. Place 2 ficelles on each of 2 large baking trays. Cover the loaves with oiled plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place for 30 minutes, until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Dissolve the remaining 3 tsp salt in the boiling water. Brush the salted water over the loaves. Use a sharp knife to make 4 diagonal slashes in the top of each loaf. Bake for 15–20 minutes, until light gold. After 10 minutes, switch the positions of the baking sheets from top to bottom to ensure even baking. Transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm, with lots of butter.
