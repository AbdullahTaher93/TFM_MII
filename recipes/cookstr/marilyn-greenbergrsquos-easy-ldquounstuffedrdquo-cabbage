Combine all the ingredients for the meatballs in a large bowl, and mix well. Set the mixture aside. Prepare the sauce: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Then add the soup, 1½ soup cans of water, and the lemon juice, brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well, and stir in the shredded cabbage and crushed gingersnaps. Using your hands, form the meat mixture into balls about 1¼ inches in diameter and add them to the sauce. Cover the pot, and simmer over medium heat for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F. Transfer the meatballs and sauce to a 13 × 9-inch glass baking dish. Cover the dish and bake for 1½ hours. Spoon the meatballs and sauce over hot rice or noodles, and serve.
