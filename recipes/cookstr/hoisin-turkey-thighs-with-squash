FIRST Put the turkey pieces in a bowl and add the Marinade, toss to coat, cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let marinate for 1 hour or longer in the refrigerator. SECOND Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Toss the scallions with the marinated turkey. Pour into a large casserole with a lid, cover, and place in the oven. Bake the turkey for 30 minutes, stirring once or twice. THIRD While the turkey is cooking, cut the squash into 2-inch pieces. Toss with the toasted sesame oil. Arrange on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and cover with foil. FOURTH Place the squash in the oven next to the turkey casserole. Bake both for 20 minutes. Stir the turkey, cover, and remove the aluminum foil from the squash. Continue baking for another 25 minutes, or until both are tender. A knife pierced through the center should come out easily. Arrange the squash in a deep bowl or on a platter with a lip, and spoon the turkey with its sauce on top. Serve with steamed rice.
