Boil the potatoes until almost tender. Preheat the oven to 350°. Butter a shallow ovenproof baking dish. When cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes and cut into ½-inch thick slices. Place in the prepared baking dish. In a small saucepan, dissolve the brown sugar in the bourbon over moderate heat. Add the melted butter and lemon zest. Pour the glaze over the potatoes and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until glazed and heated through.
