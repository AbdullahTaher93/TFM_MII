Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter the insides of four 4 oz (120ml) ramekins and coat with sugar, tapping out the excess. Whisk the sugar and egg yolks until light and creamy. Add the coconut milk and desiccated coconut; mix well. Divide among the ramekins. Place the ramekins in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides. Bake for about 25 minutes, until set. Remove from the pan and cool briefly. Run a knife around the inside of each ramekin to loosen the custard. Invert onto individual dessert plates. Refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours. Serve chilled.
