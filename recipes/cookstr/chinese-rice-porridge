Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and add a cup of boiling water. Let stand about 20 minutes, until softened. Drain, reserving the soaking water. Cut the mushrooms into small pieces using kitchen scissors, discarding the stems. Heat the oil in a wok over low heat. Add the carrot, ginger, garlic, and crushed peppers and cook gently for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and pour in the stock. Measure two-thirds of the mushroom water and strain through a fine sieve into the rice mixture. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, about 40 minutes. Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes, or until the rice has broken down to a porridge-like consistency. Stir in the scallions, soy sauce, season with pepper, and sprinkle with the cilantro. Serve hot.
