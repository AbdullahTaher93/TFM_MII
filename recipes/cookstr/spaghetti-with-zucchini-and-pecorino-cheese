In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the zucchini and onions and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft. Add the wine, increase the heat to high, and continue cooking for another 2 minutes, or until most of the wine has evaporated. Season with the salt and pepper. Bring to a boil 4 quarts (3.8 L) of water. Salt the water generously, add the spaghetti, and cook to al dente, following the package directions. Drain and toss with the vegetable sauce. Serve hot, sprinkled with the pecorino cheese.
