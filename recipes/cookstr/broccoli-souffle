Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). In a large pot of boiling water, cook broccoli until tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Rinse under cold water and drain. In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Cook garlic, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, dill, pepper and nutmeg. (Sauce will be very thick.) Remove from heat. Stir feta cheese (if using) into sauce. Beat egg yolks into sauce. Stir in drained broccoli. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt on high speed until soft peaks form. Fold one-quarter of the egg whites into the broccoli-cheese sauce. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Pour into prepared pan and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese (if using). Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown on top. Serve immediately. Variations: Substitute 8 cups (2 L) chopped stemmed kale (about 1 bunch) for the broccoli. Cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water and press out excess moisture. Substitute aged Cheddar cheese for the feta.
