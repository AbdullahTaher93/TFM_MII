Cook the noodles in 3 quarts of rapidly boiling, lightly salted water until tender but still al dente, about 10 minutes. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9 Ã— 13 baking dish, preferably of heavy ceramic or heatproof glass. Beat the eggs with the sugar, then beat in the vanilla and cinnamon. Drain the noodles, but do not dry too thoroughly; if noodles are too dry, the pudding win be heavy. Turn the hot noodles into the egg mixture, adding the raisins and the cottage cheese. Combine thoroughly but gently so you do not break up the noodles. Turn into the buttered baking dish. Dot the top generously with butter and bake for about 50 minutes, or until the pudding is set and the top is golden brown. Serve hot, plain or sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and with sour cream on the side.
