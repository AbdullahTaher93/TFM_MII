Remove the skin, head and tail from the trout. Gently pull the fillets from the bones, leaving even the very fine bones attached. In a mixing bowl, gently shred the fillets with two forks; remove any fine bones now. Set aside. Cook the celery and onion in butter over medium-low heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add, with pepper, to the fish. Cool. Beat the cream until it holds soft peaks. Gently fold into the trout.Refrigerate for at least 3 to 4 hours, or up to 2 days, before using.
