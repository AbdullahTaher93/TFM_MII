Melt a schmear of butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Assemble 4 cheese sandwiches--2 slices of cheese per sandwich--buttering the outside of the bread. Fry the sandwiches for 2 minutes on each side, weighed down (with a foil-wrapped brick or can of tomatoes on top of a plate). Take the sandwiches out of the pan and let them cool off for a few minutes, then cut each sandwich into 8 tiny triangles or cubes, as desired.
