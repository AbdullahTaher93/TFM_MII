Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add the almonds and sauté, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Meanwhile, dredge the crabs lightly with flour and shake off the excess. Melt the remaining butter in another skillet over medium-low heat; when it is hot and foaming, add the crabs. Sauté the crabs over high heat, turning occasionally with tongs, until crisp and reddish-brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the crabs to a heated plate. Squeeze the lemon juice into the skillet and bring the butter and juices to a boil. Add the parsley, stir, and pour over the crabs. Remove the almonds from their butter with a slotted spoon and sprinkle over the crabs. Garnish with the lemon wedges and serve immediately.
