Prep: Rinse chicken and pat dry. Chop onion into ½-inch dice. Heat olive oil in soup pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook until undersides are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn and brown the other side, about 5 minutes more. Transfer chicken to plate. Pour out all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot. Return pot to stove and reduce heat to medium. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until onion softens, about 3 minutes. Return chicken to pot. Add tomatoes and chiles with juices, chicken broth, 1 cup water, corn, and oregano. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and partially cover pot. Simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Transfer chicken to cutting board. Cut meat into bite-size pieces, discarding skin and bones. Return meat to pot. Skim fat from surface of soup. Serve hot, topping each serving with a handful of tortilla chips. Variation: Spice it up by adding a minced jalapeño and 2 minced garlic cloves to the pot with the onion.
