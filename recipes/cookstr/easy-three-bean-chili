Place a large saucepan or soup pot over medium-high heat and wait 2 minutes. Add the oil and wait about 30 seconds, then add the onion, peppers, and salt. Cook, stirring often, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the onions are translucent and both the onions and peppers are beginning to soften. Add the chili powder, garlic, cumin, oregano, basil, and cayenne; saut√© until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, and vegetable broth, and bring to a boil. Add all the beans, and bring to a boil again. Reduce the heat, partially cover the pot, and let the chili simmer gently for 20 minutes-or as long as 1 hour. (If simmering longer, give it a stir every 10 minutes or so to see if it needs some additional stock.) Grind in some black pepper, and taste to adjust the salt. Serve hot.
