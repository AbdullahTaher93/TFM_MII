In a large soup pot over medium heat, melt butter. Add onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper and saut√© until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour. Add broth and stir until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add wine, seasonings, and chicken. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream until blended. Return pan to heat, but do not boil. Serve in bowls.
