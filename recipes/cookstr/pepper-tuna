Lightly coat each tuna fillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil, using your fingers to spread it out evenly. Season the tuna fillets lightly with salt. Spread the pepper out on a clean dry surface and roll the tuna fillets in the pepper, pressing down to make sure that it adheres to the fish. Warm the remaining olive oil in a pan large enough to hold the tuna over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the tuna fillets. Sear on all sides, about 90 seconds for each of 4 sides or longer for more well done. Remove the tuna from the pan, slice each fillet into Â¾-inch slices, divide among 4 dinner plates, drizzle with the lemon juice, and serve at once.
