Preheat the oven to 225Â°F. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients expect the crab and vegetable oil. Fold in the crabmeat. Form into cakes about 1 inch thick. If the mixture will not form a firm cake, mix in 2 tablespoons more mayonnaise. Cover a baking sheet with layers of paper towels to drain the cakes. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Gently place 6 cakes in the pan and cook until golden, about 5 minutes on each side, turning the cakes with a spatula. If the pan gets too hot, turn down the heat to medium-low. Transfer the cakes to the paper towel-lined baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Add 2 more tablespoons oil to the pan and cook the remaining cakes.
