Prep: Cut chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper. Add chicken to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in skillet. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until their juices evaporate, about 10 minutes. Add shallots and cook until they soften, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with flour and tarragon and mix well. Stir in milk and bring to simmer. Return chicken to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chicken shows no sign of pink when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon over noodles and serve. Variations Substitute 1 cup chicken broth for an equal amount of milk. Add 3 tablespoons dry sherry to the skillet with the milk; substitute chopped fresh parsley for the tarragon (do not use dried parsley). Dressing It Up: Add ½ cup chopped roasted red peppers and/or 1 cup thawed frozen peas to the fricassée during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Stir in ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
