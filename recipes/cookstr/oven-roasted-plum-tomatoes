Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cut off the tips of the tomatoes and their bottom core. Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise. Toss the tomato halves together in a bowl with the oil, thyme, salt, and pepper. Lay the tomatoes on the baking sheet, cut side up, and pour over them any seasoned oil that was left in the bottom of the bowl. Roast until the skins are shriveled and the tops are lightly browned, 20-25 minutes. Cool them to room temperature and then use your fingers to gently pinch off the shriveled skins. Serve at room temperature.
