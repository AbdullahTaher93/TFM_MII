Sprinkle the cutlets on both sides with salt. Heat the oil in a large, shallow casserole. Brown the cutlets over high heat and remove them to a warm platter. Reduce the heat and saut√© the onion, garlic, and green pepper for 5 minutes. Add the chorizo and cook 2 minutes more. Stir in the sherry, chicken broth, tomato sauce, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Return the cutlets, spoon some sauce over them. Cover and cook slowly 15 minutes.
