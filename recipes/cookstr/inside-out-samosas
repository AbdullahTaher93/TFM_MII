Put the potatoes in a 3-quart saucepan, cover with cold water, and add a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and boil until a fork easily pierces the fresh, about 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and cool slightly. In the meantime, drop the diced carrots into the boiling water and blanch for 2 minutes, then drain. Slip off the potato skins, transfer the potatoes to a medium bowl, and smash with a fork or a potato masher, leaving some lumps for texture. Melt the butter in a small sauté pan. Add the coriander and cumin seeds and toast in the butter for 2 minutes. Add the onion, ginger, and garlic and cook until just starting to brown on the edges. Remove from the heat. Add the onion mixture, carrots, peas, garam masala, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt, and the pepper to the potatoes and mix gently with your hands. Use a ¼-cup measure for easy portioning, and pat the potatoes into a fat little cake. Form the remaining cakes in the same way. Spread the flour out on a plate or tray. Dredge each cake lightly in flour; use a light touch—don’t smush the cakes. Add a slick of oil to a large nonstick skillet (trust me, you want nonstick) and get it nice and hot. Working in batches, carefully place the cakes in the pan and get them good and brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Keep the finished cakes covered and warm, and add more oil to the pan as necessary. Serve with mango chutney.
