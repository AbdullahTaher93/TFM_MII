Pat the steak or steaks dry; cut in half crosswise, and place in a nonreactive dish or gallon-size Ziploc plastic bag. Combine the thyme, sherry, vinegar, lemon juice, cumin, chili powder, chipotle pepper and juice, wine, and oil in a blender or food processor and blend to purée. Pour over the steak and cover the pan or seal the bag. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Remove the steak from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature. Preheat the broiler or prepare coals for grilling. Broil or grill the steak until seared and nicely browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook for 2½ minutes more for medium-rare or 3 minutes for medium. Transfer the steak to a cutting board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut the meat on the bias across the grain into ¼-inch-thick slices. The meat will look rarer than it is. Sprinkle with salt before serving.
