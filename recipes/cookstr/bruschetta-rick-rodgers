Build a charcoal fire in an outdoor grill and let bum until covered with white ash. Or preheat a gas grill on High. Grill the bread, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Rub each slice on one side with the garlic. Drizzle or brush the oil over the bread. Cut each slice crosswise into 3 or 4 pieces. (The bruschetta can be stored uncovered at room temperature for up to 2 hours.)
