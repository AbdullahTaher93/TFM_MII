Preheat oven to 275°F (140°F, or gas mark 1). Season duck with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, sear the duck on both sides over medium-high heat. Place duck in a large oven-safe cooking pan and arrange thyme sprigs on top. In the same skillet used for searing, add the onion, carrot, garlic, and ginger. Cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cooked vegetable mixture to the cooking pan, along with the cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon (6 g) mint, wine, Cointreau, zest, orange pieces, and water. Cover with lid or foil and bake for 1 to 1½ hours until the duck is very tender. Remove the duck from the pan to a serving dish. Transfer the liquid and vegetables to a saucepan, bring to a simmer, and reduce slightly to a sauce consistency. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon (6 g) mint and lemon juice and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve duck with sauce in shallow bowls.
