In work bowl of a food processor fitted with metal blade, process butter until smooth, about 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Add confectioner's sugar and process until it just begins to gather, about 15 seconds. With motor running, drizzle milk and almond extract through the feed tube and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. If you would like to use this as a glaze you can add additional milk to thin the texture. For a stiffer frosting add additional confectioner's sugar after adding milk. Variations: Add 1 cup (250 mL) toasted sweetened coconut flaked for a flavorful frosting. Use the same amount of vanilla in place of almond extract for vanilla buttercream.
