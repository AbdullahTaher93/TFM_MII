Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C, or gas mark 6). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Lay out the phyllo on the parchment paper and form into an 8 x 12-inch (20 x 30 cm) rectangle (the exact size or shape is not at all important here). Build up the crust edges by rolling the dough under. Brush the crust edges with olive oil. Gently spread the pesto on the phyllo, top with the tomatoes, and brush with the remaining oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 20 minutes or until the edges begin to brown. Variation: Use any kind of pesto or oil-based spread that you like, such as sundried tomato pesto, rosemary pesto, or vegan tapenade.
