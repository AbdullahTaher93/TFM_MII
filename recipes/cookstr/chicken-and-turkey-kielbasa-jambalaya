Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Wash chicken. Pat dry with paper towels. In a bowl combine the onion, celery, and bell pepper. Set vegetable mixture aside. Heat oil in an ovenproof pot large enough to hold the rice and chicken until hot. Add the turkey kielbasa and cook until it begins to brown. Remove kielbasa from pot and set aside. Add the chicken pieces to pot, a few at a time, and brown on all sides. Return kielbasa and all of the chicken pieces to pot. Stir in the Seasoning Mix, half of the vegetable mixture, and the garlic. Cook until the vegetables are tender but not brown. Stir in the tomato sauce. Bring to a simmer. Stir in the remaining vegetable mixture along with the chopped tomatoes. Remove pot from heat. Stir in the Basic Vegetable Stock and the uncooked rice. Bake, uncovered, until chicken is cooked through and rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and stir.
