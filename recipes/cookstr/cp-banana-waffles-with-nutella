1 In a mixing bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set aside. 2 In another mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and milk. Add the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Add the bananas and melted butter and mix well. 3 In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whites into the batter. Mix only until incorporated. Do not overmix or the egg whites will deflate. 4 Spray a waffle iron with nonstick vegetable cooking spray and heat the iron according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. 5 Ladle about a quarter of the batter onto the waffle iron and cook until the waffle is lightly browned and lifts easily from the waffle iron. Repeat to make 4 waffles. Serve topped with Nutella.
