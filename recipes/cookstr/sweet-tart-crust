Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and work it in with your fingertips until the mixture is crumbly and well mixed. Mix the egg and vanilla together with a fork and stir into the flour mixture. Gather the dough into a ball and knead just a little. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 9-inch tart pan. Roll out the dough on lightly floured parchment paper to about 1/8 inch thick. Chill again for about 5 minutes. Press the dough into the pan, taking care to tuck the corners in. Fold the excess dough back onto itself to form a lip all the way around, just slightly higher than the rim of the tart pan. (This is important, as the filling is very liquidy, and you want to fill the tart all the way to the rim of the pan. The higher edge will keep the filling from spilling out.) Keep a tiny ball of excess dough to repair any cracks in the baked shell. Line the shell with a piece of foil or parchment and fill with dry beans, making sure to press them up against the sides. Bake for 10-15 minutes, then carefully remove the foil and beans, check for cracks, and use your extra dough as “spackle” to fill them in. Bake an additional 5-10 minutes, until cooked through and light golden brown. Remove the crust from the oven and let it cool for at least 5 minutes.
