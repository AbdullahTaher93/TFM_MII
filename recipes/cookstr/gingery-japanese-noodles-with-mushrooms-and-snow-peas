Bring the broth or water with bouillon cube to a simmer in a large saucepan. Add the noodles and cook at a rapid boil until al dente. Meanwhile, heat the oils plus Â¼ cup water in a stir-fry pan. Stir in the ginger and soy sauce, then add the snow peas and mushrooms. Cook over medium-high, stirring frequently, until the snow peas are tender-crisp and the mushrooms are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cooked noodles and their broth and the scallions. Season with pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer. Serve at once in shallow bowls, including some of the broth with each serving.
