Wash the chicken well in cold water and set aside. Place all the marinade ingredients except the oil in a blender or food processor and process to a paste. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the oil. Place the chicken pieces in the bowl and rub to coat them with marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 8 hours. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill or preheat the broiler. To grill the chicken, place it on a rack about 5 inches from the coals or flame and grill, turning several times (tongs work well), until cooked through, about 20 minutes. To broil the chicken, place it on a lightly oiled rack in a broiler pan and put the pan in the oven so the meat is about 5 inches below the broiler element. Prop the door open slightly and broil for about 20 minutes, turning the chicken once after about 7 minutes, and then again after about 15 minutes. Test for doneness with a skewer: The juices should run clear. Transfer the chicken to a platter and serve hot.
