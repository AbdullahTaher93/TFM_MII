Rinse the chicken legs under cold running water and pat them dry with paper towels. Place the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, bouillon cubes, salt, oregano, and pepper in a jumbo (2½-gallon) resealable plastic bag or large nonreactive bowl—glass, plastic, ceramic, or stainless steel. Add the chicken legs. Seal the bag or cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate for a few hours or as long as overnight. When ready to cook, place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place the chicken on a large rimmed baking sheet. Scatter the lemon slices over the chicken. Bake the chicken until it is cooked through, tender, and lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Place the Papaya and Arugula Salad in the middle of a large platter. Arrange the chicken legs with the baked lemon slices around the salad. The chicken can be served warm or chilled. If you’d like to make the chicken legs ahead of time they’ll keep for 24 hours; you can reheat them in a 400°F oven for 10 minutes, if you want to serve them warm.
