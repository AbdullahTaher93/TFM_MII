After about 20 minutes, heat the remaining oil over high heat. Season the lamb with salt and pepper. Add to the pan and cook, until browned on all sides. Transfer to the roasting pan with the vegetables. Roast about 10 minutes, until the center of the lamb is 130째F (55째C). Allow the lamb to rest for 10 minutes.
