Core, peel, and cut the apples into large chunks, tossing them with the lemon juice to prevent discoloration. Place the apples and all the remaining ingredients in a large heavy pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover partially, and cook until the apples are very tender, 15 minutes. Uncover the pot and cook 5 minutes more. Remove the pot from the heat and discard the cinnamon stick. Cool to room temperature and then refrigerate, covered, until ready to use, up to 5 days.
