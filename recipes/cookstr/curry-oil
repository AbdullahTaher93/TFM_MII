In a small saucepan, gently heat the curry powder with a few drops of water, stirring constantly, over low heat. When the aroma emerges, remove from the heat and scrape the wet powder into a small bowl. Gradually whisk in the oil and pour into a wide-mouthed glass jar. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate overnight. The solids will settle to the bottom. Stir and refrigerate again, repeating this process for 2 days. To use, line a strainer with a double layer of cheesecloth. Ladle the oil off the top or carefully pour the oil into the strainer, leaving the solids at the bottom of the jar. The solids can be reused up to 2 additional times with fresh oil.
