• Drain the tofu, slice into bars, and lay them over paper towels to drain off moisture. You may have to do this several times (removing soaked paper towels and laying down dry ones) so that the tofu will hold its texture and absorb flavors. Cut the bars into cubes. • Bring 2 cups of the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the quinoa. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is tender. about 20 minutes. • Place chard in a steamer basket over boiling water. Steam the greens just until wilted. Set aside. • Place the sesame seeds in a shallow bowl and gently toll the tofu cubes in them to coat on all sides. • In a large nonstick skillet, heat the soy sauce and remaining 3 tablespoons water. Add the ginger and garlic and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the sesame-coated tofu cubes. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes. • Fluff the quinoa with a fork and divide among 4 serving bowls. Place the greens over the quinoa and top with the tofu. Serve with additional soy sauce and lemon juice or rice vinegar.
