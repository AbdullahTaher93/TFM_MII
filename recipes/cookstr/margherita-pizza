First, oil a tortilla round for each pizza you plan to make: sprinkle olive oil on a sturdy cookie sheet or jelly roll pan, and press the tortillas in the oil on the tray to coat them well on one side, and then turn them over, so they are oiled on the other side. Preheat the oven to 500Â°F. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top of the oiled tortilla. Add the tomato, a good sprinkling of salt and freshly ground black pepper, and the mozzarella. Sprinkle on a little more salt and pepper, and top with the good olive oil. You can cook the tortillas directly on the cookie sheet or directly on an oven stone, using a wooden peel to transfer them. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until bubbly and crisp. Let the pizzas rest out of the oven for a couple of minutes, and then sprinkle with the basil. Cut into 8 wedges, and serve with a glass of your favorite wine.
