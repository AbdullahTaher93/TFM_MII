Combine the basil, oil, and salt and pepper to taste in the container of a food processor or blender and puree. Place a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl and pour the basil oil into the sieve. Use a soft spatula to work the basil oil through the sieve, discarding the solids. Place the finished oil in a glass jar or bottle and cover. The oil will keep, refrigerated, for several days. Variations: Add thyme, rosemary, cilantro, lavender, verbena, or your favorite fresh herb in combination or instead of the basil. Add a dash of red chile flakes for a slightly spicy oil
