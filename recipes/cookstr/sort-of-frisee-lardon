Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. FOR THE BACON: Cut each strip of bacon into 4 pieces. In a skillet, over medium-low heat, cook the bacon until cooked all the way through but not crisp. Drain it on a paper towel, and reserve the fat. FOR THE CROUTONS: Cut the loaf of bread in half and reach in beneath the crust to pull out 1½–2-inch pieces of bread. Place the bread chunks on a baking sheet, drizzle them with the olive oil, and toss well. Toast them in the oven for about 15–20 minutes, until they’re lightly browned, shaking the pan occasionally to ensure they’re evenly baked. When the croutons are cool enough to handle, rub them with the garlic clove and set aside. TO COOK THE EGGS: Place the eggs in a medium saucepan with water to cover. Bring them to a boil, then turn down the heat to a low simmer. Simmer the eggs for 5 minutes, then plunge them into a large bowl of ice water for a minute or so. Take them out as soon as they’re cool enough to handle. FOR THE SALAD: In a huge bowl, toss to combine the radicchio, frisée, dandelion greens, toasted bread, and bacon. TO MAKE THE VINAIGRETTE: In a medium-sized skillet, over medium heat, warm the bacon fat (and olive oil, if necessary). Add the shallots, and cook them for 2–3 minutes, until they just begin to sizzle. Whisk in the vinegar, salt, and pepper, and cook for about 1 minute. Whisk in the mustard, and cook another 30 seconds. Remove the vinaigrette from the heat, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Pour most of the vinaigrette over the salad, and toss well to combine. Cut the top ½ inch off the eggs and, using a spoon, scoop them out of the shells in large spoonfuls into the bowl. Pile the salad onto 4 plates, and drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over each.
