Pat the steak dry and place it in a tight-fitting glass baking dish. Combine the scallion, jalapeños, cilantro, ¼ cup of the oil, the lime juice, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a blender. Purée until well blended. Pour the mixture over the steak. Marinate at room temperature for 1½ to 2 hours, turning the steak at least once. Prepare coals for grilling. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet or wok. When nearly smoking, add the bell peppers and onion. Stir-fry over high heat for 2 minutes, lower the heat to medium, and cook, covered, until the vegetables are soft, 3 to 4 minutes more. Arrange the avocado slices and salsa in serving bowls and place them on a buffet or dining table. Remove the steak from the marinade and pat it dry. Grill until seared and nicely browned on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook 4 minutes more for medium-rare or 5 minutes more for medium. Transfer the steak to a cutting board. Let it rest for 5 minutes. Warm the tortillas on the grill. Carve the meat across the grain into ¼-inch-thick slices. Cut these slices lengthwise in thirds, salt the meat, and arrange the pieces next to the vegetables on a platter. Wrap the tortillas in a napkin and place on a plate. Place the platter and plate on the table and invite each diner to fill a tortilla with meat, vegetables, avocado, and salsa.
