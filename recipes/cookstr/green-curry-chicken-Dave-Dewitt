Heat a heavy saucepan over medium heat, add the cream, and simmer gently until boiling. Boil for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the cream forms a sheen on top. Add the curry paste and, using the back of a spoon, mash the paste until it becomes smooth. Continue to fry until the mixture darkens and becomes very fragrant, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken and stir to coat the pieces. Stir in enough of the coconut milk to reach the desired consistency. Add the eggplant, sugar, fish sauce, lime leaves, if using, and salt to taste. Gently simmer the sauce for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken and eggplant are done. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Add the basil and chile and continue to cook for an additional 2 minutes. To serve, remove the kaffir lime leaves, place the curry in a serving bowl, and garnish with the fresh basil leaves.
