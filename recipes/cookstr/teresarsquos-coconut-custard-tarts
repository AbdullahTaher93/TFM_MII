Set out one 12-cup or two 6-cup muffin tins. Cut the chilled puff pastry into 3 equal pieces. Work with 1 piece at a time, keeping the remaining pastry loosely covered with plastic in the refrigerator. On a lightly floured work surface, flatten the pastry with a well-floured rolling pin. Then roll it out as thin as possible to about a 10-inch square. (The dough may resist or spring back; if it does, begin working on another piece and let the first one rest for several minutes.) Using a plate or a pot lid as a guide, with a very sharp knife, cut out four 5-inch circles of pastry. Place each over a muffin cup and press down lightly so the pastry slides into place; it may not come completely to the top of the cup. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry. Wrap the muffin tin(s) in plastic and place in the freezer until just before using. Place a baking stone or unglazed quarry tiles, if you have them, on a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F. To prepare the filling, place the eggs in the bowl of a mixer, or another large bowl, and beat at medium speed for about a minute. Gradually add the sugar, then beat at medium-high speed for 4 minutes. Add the flour and salt and beat for 30 seconds. Add the coconut and beat briefly, about 20 seconds. Pour the filling mixture into the frozen tart shells, filling them about two-thirds full. Sprinkle generously with confectioners’ sugar, and let stand for 15 minutes undisturbed. Once the oven has preheated, place a baking sheet on the rack. Wait another 10 minutes before placing the tarts in the oven on the baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the tops are a light golden brown. Wearing oven mitts, care fuly tip the tarts out onto a rack to cool to lukewarm or room temperature. The tarts remain delicious for 2 to 3 days. If keeping for longer than 12 hours, seal in plastic and keep in a cool place or in the refrigerator.
