In a bowl, beat together the eggs, soy sauce, and sesame oil until well blended. Stir in the green onion and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a nonstick saut√© pan over medium-high heat and swirl to coat. Pour in the egg mixture. Cook, without stirring, until the egg is softly set. Break up the egg with a spatula. Add the ham, shiitake mushrooms, peas, and cooked rice. Cook, stirring, until the rice mixture is heated through. Season with additional soy sauce to taste. Garnish with the sliced green onions, almonds, and cranberries. Serve hot.
