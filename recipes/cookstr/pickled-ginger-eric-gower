To prepare the ginger, peel it, then slice it with a mandoline or Benriner slicer or, if your knife skills are good, a sharp knife. The formula is easy to remember: 1 part ginger, 1 part vinegar, and a touch of sweetener (to taste). Hereâ€™s one example. Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan, add the sliced ginger, and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and transfer the ginger to a container with a tight-fitting lid. In the same saucepan, heat the vinegar and honey until it barely simmers; stir. Pour the vinegar mixture over the ginger. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Keeps for at least 6 months.
