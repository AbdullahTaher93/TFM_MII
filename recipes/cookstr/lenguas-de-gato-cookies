Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla until about as thick as sour cream. Fold in the whites. In three additions, sift the flour over the mixture, folding it in after each addition. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag with a ½ in (13mm) plain tip. Pipe 3in (7.5cm) long strips of batter on the baking sheet, spacing them at least 2in (5cm) apart. Bake about 15 minutes, until the edges are golden brown in color. Let cool briefly, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
