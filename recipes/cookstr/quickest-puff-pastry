Cut 8 ounces (2 sticks) of the butter into ½-to ¼-inch dice, place on a plate, and refrigerate while preparing the remaining ingredients. Measure the water and stir in the salt to dissolve. Set aside. Coarsely dice the remaining 4 tablespoons (½ stick) of butter. Place the flour in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the 4 tablespoons butter and pulse until the butter is absorbed—about ten to twelve 1-second pulses. Add the chilled butter and pulse once or twice to distribute. Add water and salt mixture and pulse repeatedly, until the dough forms a rough ball—do not over process. Flour the work surface and turn the dough out onto it. Shape the dough into a rough rectangle and place between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Press the dough with a rolling pin to flatten, then roll back and forth several times with the rolling pin to make a 12 × 18-inch rectangle of dough. Peel away the top layer of plastic wrap and turn the dough over onto the floured work surface. Peel away the second piece of wrap. Fold the dough in thirds the short way, to make a 4 × 18-inch rectangle, then roll the dough up from one of the 4-inch ends. Make sure to roll the end under the dough. Press the roll of dough out into an approximatley 6- inch square, using the palms of your hands or a rolling pin. Wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm.
