Combine the black-eyed peas with enough water to cover by 1 inch in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, and cook for 1 minute. Then remove the pan from the heat, cover tightly, and let stand for 1 hour. (Or soak the peas overnight in a large bowl with enough cold water to cover by 1 inch.) Drain the peas well. Place the black-eyed peas in a 5-quart Dutch oven and add the 3 quarts water. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for 15 minutes. Drain the peas in a colander set over a large bowl, reserving both the peas and 4 cups of the cooking liquid; discard the remaining cooking liquid. Heat the oil in a 5-quart flameproof casserole. In batches, add the chicken and cook over medium-high heat, turning often, until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside. Add the onions, garlic, and ginger to the casserole and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the curry powder and cayenne, and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the reserved cooking liquid, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and salt; bring to a boil. Stir in the brown rice, reserved black-eyed peas, and carrots, and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook 10 minutes. Return the chicken to the casserole, cover, and cook for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400Â°. Stir the green beans into the rice mixture, cover, and transfer the casserole to the oven. Bake until the rice is tender and the chicken shows no sign of pink at the bone when prodded with the tip of a sharp knife, about 30 minutes. Remove the casserole from the oven and let stand 15 minutes before serving.
