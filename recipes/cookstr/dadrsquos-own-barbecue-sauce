Place a saucepan on medium high until it gets hot, about 45 seconds. Add the oil and the onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for a minute more. Transfer the onion and garlic to a medium bowl. Add the ketchup, mustard, honey, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, molasses, cinnamon, salt, and cayenne pepper, and mix well. Pour over the meat.
