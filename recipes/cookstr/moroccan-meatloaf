Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the orange and lemon slices and mint leaves, and mix well. Turn the mixture into a lightly sprayed or oiled 9-by-5-inch loaf pan and gently pat down. Bake until the loaf is firm and the top is lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Lay the orange and lemon slices alternately on top of the loaf, overlapping slightly and bake until the fruit slices are warmed and juicy, about 15 minutes longer. Let stand in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Remove the loaf from the pan and slice to serve. Garnish with the mint leaves.
