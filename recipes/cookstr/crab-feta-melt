In a medium bowl, stir together the crab, mayonnaise, feta, celery, corn, curry, and pepper to taste. Set aside. (The crab mixture can be made up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before using). To assemble: Butter one side of each slice of bread. Place 4 slices on your work surface, buttered side down. Distribute the crab mixture evenly over the 4 slices, followed by the cheese. Place the remaining 4 bread slices on top, buttered side up. STOVETOP METHOD: Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Put the sandwiches in the skillet (in batches if necessary), cover, and cook for 2 minutes, or until the undersides are golden brown and the cheese has begun to melt. Uncover, and turn the sandwiches with a spatula, pressing firmly to flatten them slightly. Cook for 1 minute, or until the undersides are golden brown. Turn the sandwiches again, press with the spatula, and cook for 30 seconds, or until the Monterey Jack cheese has melted completely. Let cool slightly before serving. SANDWICH MAKER METHOD: Preheat the sandwich maker. Follow directions for sandwich assembly, and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions. If your sandwich maker doesn't have an adjustable lid, be very careful when you lower the lid; if you put too much weight on the sandwiches the crab mixture might ooze out. GAS GRILL METHOD: Brush the grill rack with oil and preheat the grill to medium-high. Follow directions for sandwich assembly. Put the sandwiches on the grill and follow directions for the stovetop method.
