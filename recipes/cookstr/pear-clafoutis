Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Generously butter a 10-inch cake pan and set aside. Use an electric mixer to beat the egg yolks and sugar together until thick and pale yellow. Add the buttermilk, vanilla and almond extracts, and cinnamon, and beat until well mixed. Add the flour and stir with a kitchen fork, leaving small lumps in the batter. In a clean bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites and the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Fold the beaten whites into the batter. Do not overmixâ€“streaks are okay. Scatter the pears into the prepared pan and pour in the batter. Bake for 8 minutes, then lower the oven to 325 degrees and continue baking for another 20 minutes. The clafoutis is ready when barely browned on the top. (It can also be refrigerated for a great breakfast.)
