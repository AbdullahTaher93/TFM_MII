Remove ¼ cup of cool stock and slowly mix it with the cornstarch to make a smooth paste. Add I teaspoon sesame oil and set this mixture aside. Beat the eggs lightly (they should not froth) and add the remaining I teaspoon sesame oil to it. Mix well and set aside. Heat the remaining 3¾ cups stock in a 2- to 3-quart pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, add the corn, salt, pepper, and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer and turn heat to low. Stir the cornstarch mixture and pour it into the hot stock. Stir and cook on low heat until the mixture thickens slightly. Turn off the heat. Immediately pour in the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream, covering the entire surface of the soup with it. Stir gently. Pour the soup into individual bowls and sprinkle each bowl with some of the sliced scallions.
