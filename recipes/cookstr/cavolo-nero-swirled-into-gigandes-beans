Pick over the beans, rinse well, place in a bowl, cover with cold water, and let soak for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Drain the beans and place in a saucepan. Add water to cover by a few inches, add thyme or a rosemary sprig, and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer gently until the beans are tender, 1 to 2 hours. The timing will depend on how long the beans were soaked and how long they sat on the shelf. Just before the beans are ready, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the cavolo nero and parboil for about 5 minutes. Drain well. In a large, heavy pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and the cavolo nero and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, remove the herb sprigs, and discard the garlic. Keep warm. When the beans are ready, scoop out and reserve about 1 cup of the cooking water and then drain the beans. Season the beans with salt and pepper. Place the beans in a warmed deep platter with a lip and swirl in the cavolo nero and enough of the reserved cooking water to make the dish juicy. Drizzle generously with olive oil and pass the cheese at the table.
