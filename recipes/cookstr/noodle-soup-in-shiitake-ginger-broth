Cook the linguine in a large pot of boiling salted water until it is al dente. Drain and place it in a bowl. Add the sesame oil, toss to coat the pasta, and set aside. Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan with the mushrooms, ginger, scallions, and tamari. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes or until the shiitakes soften. Blend the miso paste with Â¼ cup of the hot broth in a small bowl. Stir the miso mixture into the soup, add the linguine, sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.
