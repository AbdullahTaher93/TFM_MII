Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the soba noodles and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or according to package directions, until they are barely tender. Use tongs to transfer the cooked noodles to an individual-serving bowl, reserving the cooking water in the pot. Return the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the edamame and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and add to the noodles. Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a small, dry skillet over medium-high heat, shaking the pan frequently, until lightly browned and smelling toasty, 2 to 3 minutes. Be careful not to let them burn. Immediately transfer to a plate to cool. When they have cooled, coarsely chop them. To make the dressing, combine the almond butter, vinegar, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Add the hot water, stirring to mix well. If the dressing seems too thick, add more hot water, a teaspoon at a time, until it has reached the consistency you want. Add salt to taste; add more vinegar if you want the sauce tangier, and more red pepper flakes if youâ€™d like it spicier. Add the dressing to the noodles and edamame, along with the scallion, bell pepper, and chopped almonds. Toss to combine, adding more water if necessary, and eat.
