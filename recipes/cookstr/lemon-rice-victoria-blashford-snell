Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the mustard seeds, cardamom pods, turmeric, chiles, ginger, garlic, and curry leaves. Cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes, or until very aromatic. Add the lemon juice and cook for 1 minute. Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, until the rice is heated and coated in the spices. Transfer to a platter, sprinkle with the cashews and cilantro, and serve hot.
