Rinse chicken necks and place in a 26-cup (6.5 L) saucepan or stockpot. Add parsley, bay leaves, carrot, celery, onion halves stuck with cloves, lemon juice, peppercorns and thyme. Add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 1 Â½ hours. Remove from heat. Set a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl. Ladle stock through sieve into bowl, leaving behind dregs. Discard vegetables and herbs. Strip any chicken meat from bones and reserve for another use. Season stock to taste with salt and pepper. If not using stock immediately, pour into 2-cup (500 mL) and 4-cup (1 L) airtight containers. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, until chilled. Skim off any fat and discard. Variations: Turkey backs or necks can be substituted for the chicken pieces.
