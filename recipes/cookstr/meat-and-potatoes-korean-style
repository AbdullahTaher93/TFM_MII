Heat the oil in the pressure cooker over high heat until beginning to smoke. Add the beef and saut√© over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, and chile peppers and stir to mix. Add the sake, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and water and stir to mix. Add the potato slices but don't stir. Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat, about 2 minutes. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 8 minutes to finish cooking. With the steam valve pointing away from your face, gently remove any remaining pressure, remove the lid, and let sit for 5 minutes more. Top with the scallion slivers and cilantro and serve right away.
