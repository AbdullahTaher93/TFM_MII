Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add the udon noodles and cook 10 minutes, or according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water. Combine all of the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Stir until well blended. Place the cooled noodles in individual serving bowls. Drizzle with the sauce, garnish with cucumbers and scallions, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Variations: • Top with chopped pickles or shredded nori. • For a “sesame” version, reverse the ratio of peanut butter and tahini. • Add julienned carrots or daikon radish. • Spice it up with 1 or 2 drops of extra-hot sesame oil or a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.
