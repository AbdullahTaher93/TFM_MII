Line a shallow baking sheet or a glass pie plate with aluminum foil (shiny side up) and place it on the center shelf of the oven. If using a baking sheet, preheat the oven to 425°F; if using glass, preheat to 400°F. Season both sides of your steak generously with black pepper and brush the meat evenly with olive oil. Turn on your exhaust fan now. Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or an 8- to 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until it’s very hot. Turn the heat up to high and wait about 20 seconds. Sprinkle the steak on one side with salt, then sear the meat, salted side down, for 3 minutes. Salt the top of the meat, then sear it well on the other side. Remove the pan from the stove and, using tongs, transfer the meat to the prepared baking sheet in the preheated oven. Roast the meat for 3 minutes (for medium rare) or until done to your liking. Take the meat out of the oven and let it rest on a cool plate while you cook your egg(s). Wipe out the interior of the pan used to sear the meat. Place the pan over medium heat and melt the butter (or before heating, spray the pan with vegetable spray). When the pan is hot and the butter bubbling, crack one or two eggs directly into the pan and let them cook until the white starts to turn golden on the bottom, about 1½ minutes. Sprinkle the top lightly with salt and pepper. Use a thin nonabrasive turning spatula to carefully turn the egg(s) over. Transfer the eggs to a serving plate and scatter the chives over them. Place the steak, whole or sliced, next to the eggs and tomatoes with toasted Italian bread. Serve hot.
