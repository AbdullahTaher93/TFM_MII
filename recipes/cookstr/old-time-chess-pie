Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 9-inch pie pan with crust and then crimp the edges decoratively. In a large bowl, combine the sugar and flour, and stir with a fork to mix them well. Add the butter, eggs, and vanilla. Using a fork or a whisk, stir well to combine everything into a smooth, thick filling. Pour the filling into the pie crust. Place the pie on the bottom shelf of the oven. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F, and bake until the edges puff up and the center is fairly firm, wiggling only a little when you gently nudge the pan, 30 to 40 minutes more. Place the pie on a cooling rack or a folded kitchen towel and let cool to room temperature.
