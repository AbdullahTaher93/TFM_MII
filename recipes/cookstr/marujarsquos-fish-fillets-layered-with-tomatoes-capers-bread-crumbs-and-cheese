Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. In a bowl, combine the cheese, bread crumbs, oregano, salt and pepper to taste, capers, parsley, and garlic. Generously grease with olive oil a shallow casserole dish or roasting pan. If using fresh anchovies, arrange a layer, skin side down, in the casserole. Sprinkle with salt, scatter with some of the tomatoes, and season again with salt. Sprinkle with some of the crumb mixture and continue layering until all the fish and crumbs have been used. If using larger fish fillets, arrange half of the fish, skin side down, in the casserole. Sprinkle with salt, then cover with half of the tomatoes. Season again with salt, then sprinkle half of the crumb mixture over the fish. Cover with the remaining fillets, skin side up, then the remaining tomato and crumb mixture. Drizzle the wine and oil over the fish and bake for 20 minutes, or until the fish is just done.
