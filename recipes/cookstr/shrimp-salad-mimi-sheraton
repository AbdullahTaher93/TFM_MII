Toss shrimp with onion and parsley, sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper and lemon juice and refrigerate for about Â½ hour, or until just before serving time. Add mayonnaise and trickle oil in slowly until salad has the right creamy consistency and is neither too thin nor too thick. Adjust seasoning and serve on a chilled, crisp lettuce leaf.
