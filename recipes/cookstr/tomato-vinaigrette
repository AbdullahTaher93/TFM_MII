In a bowl, whisk together all the ingredients except the oil and the herbs. Continuing to whisk, gradually add the oil, incorporating it as much as possible. This dressing will not form a complete emulsion, so the oil will rise to the top after it sits for a while. Whisk in the herbs, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Whisk again before using.
