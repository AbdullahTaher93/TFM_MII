Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Sauté the garlic with the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until the garlic softens. If you skip this step, the garlic will remain crunchy in your risotto. Scrape the garlic and remaining oil into your slow cooker. Add the uncooked Arborio rice and toss. Add the seasonings, and pour in the broth and white wine. Stir to combine. Cover and cook on high for 2 to 4 hours, or until rice is tender. It took 2½ hours for my rice to be completely tender. Stir in shredded Parmesan cheese, and let the risotto stand with the lid off for 15 minutes before serving. The finished texture will be creamy and porridge-like.
