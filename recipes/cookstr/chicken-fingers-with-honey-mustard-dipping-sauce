Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Cut each chicken breast on the diagonal into 7 strips. Mix the egg, mustard, and cayenne pepper together in a shallow bowl and toss the chicken strips to coat them. In another bowl, mix the panko, Parmesan, cilantro, and cumin. Add half the chicken pieces and toss to coat them well. Line 2 baking pans with parchment and arrange the breaded chicken on the pan, leaving some space between the chicken pieces so that they will brown nicely. Drizzle with the butter. Repeat the process with the rest of the chicken. Bake the chicken fingers until nicely colored and firm to the touch, about 25 minutes. For even browning, it helps to rotate the pans halfway through baking. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Serve the chicken fingers arranged on a platter, garnished with cilantro, with a bowl of the dipping sauce.
