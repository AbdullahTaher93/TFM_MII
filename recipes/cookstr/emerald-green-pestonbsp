Place the garlic, basil, parsley, and pine nuts in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. With the machine running constantly, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream, until the pesto is smooth, stopping when needed to scrape the side with a rubber spatula. Transfer the pesto to a medium-size bowl. Add the salt and Parmesan cheese and stir to combine. For storing and freezing instructions see the sidebar, this page.
