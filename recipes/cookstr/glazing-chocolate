Set the cooled cake on a wire rack with wax or parchment paper underneath it to catch any drips. Combine the heavy cream and vanilla extract in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly. Meanwhile, place the chocolate in a medium-sized nonreactive mixing bowl, preferably one with a handle and a small pouring spout. Remove the hot vanilla-cream mixture from the heat and pour over the chocolate. Let the heat from the cream melt the chocolate for 10 to 20 seconds, then gently whisk until smooth. Immediately pour the glaze over the cake. For a Bundt cake, pour the glaze in a thin, steady stream in a crisscross fashion, working your way around the cake for even coverage. If you want more chocolate on the cake, repeat until it looks right. This is a rich glaze, so let restraint be your guide. For Crunchy Feet, pour about 2 tablespoons of glaze directly onto the top of each one, letting it drizzle down the sides. If the bowl is empty before youâ€™re finished glazing, scrape any chocolate that has drizzled onto the parchment and reuse it for the remaining Crunchy Feet. Serve immediately, while the glaze is still warm.
