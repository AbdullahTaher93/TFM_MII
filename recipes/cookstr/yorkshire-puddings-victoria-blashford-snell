Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Crack the egg into the well and add about one-third of the milk. Beat the egg and milk together with a wooden spoon, gradually drawing in the flour from the sides of the bowl. Stir in half of the remaining milk. Change to a whisk, and whisk in the remaining milk. Let stand for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Generously grease the muffin cups with the drippings. Place the pan in the oven for about 3 minutes, or until the pan is very hot. Pour equal amounts of the batter into the muffin cups. Bake for 20–25 minutes, until the puddings are golden brown and crisp. Serve immediately.
