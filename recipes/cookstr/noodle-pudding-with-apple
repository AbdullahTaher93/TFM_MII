Soak the raisins in the rum. Boil the noodles in lightly salted water until well done—rather soft. At the same time, beat the eggs lightly with the sugar. Add the walnuts or almonds and the soaked currants or raisins together with the rum and the lemon or orange zest. Drain the noodles when they are done and stir them in. Peel, core, and coarsely grate or chop the apples and mix with the lemon juice, then add to the egg-and-noodle mixture. Mix very well and pour into a loaf pan lined with greaseproof or wax paper brushed with oil. Alternatively, pour into an oiled baking dish and cover with foil. Bake in a preheated 350°F (180°C) oven for about 50 minutes, or until lightly browned on top and turn out. Variations: Omit the orange or lemon zest and flavor with 2 teaspoons cinnamon, teaspoon nutmeg, and a pinch of ground cloves. Some people add ¾ cup (100 g) chopped candied fruit or citrus peel; some add jam. This can be served as a side dish to accompany meat. In that case use very little sugar.
