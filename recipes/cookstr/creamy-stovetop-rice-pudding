In a large saucepan, bring 2 cups (500 mL) of the water and cinnamon stick to a boil over high heat. Stir in rice and return to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, or until rice is very tender and water has been absorbed. Stir in the remaining 1 cup (250 mL) water, apple juice, brown sugar, vanilla and nutmeg. Cook, covered, over low heat until rice is creamy, about 10 minutes. Beat in eggs and currants. Cook, stirring, until thickened and creamy, about 2 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick. For best flavor, serve warm. Variation: For an extra calcium punch, try making this pudding with fortified orange juice instead of apple juice.
