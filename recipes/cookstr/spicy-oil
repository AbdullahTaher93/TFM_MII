In a small saucepan, Combine the oil, jalapeños, pepper flakes, and paprika and bring just to a simmer over medium heat. Pour the oil (and flavorings) into a heatproof bowl and let cool, then cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Strain the oil and keep refrigerated until ready to use. It can be stored in the refrigerator in a tightly sealed jar for up to 10 days–no longer.
