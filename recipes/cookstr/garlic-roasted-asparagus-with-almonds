Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Arrange the asparagus on the prepared sheet in a single layer and coat with cooking spray. Season with the garlic powder and salt and pepper. Roast for 10 minutes, then sprinkle the almonds over them and continue to roast until the asparagus spears are tender and the almonds are golden brown, about 5 more minutes.
