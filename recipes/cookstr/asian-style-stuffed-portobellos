First, press the tofu for at least 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Oil a large baking pan. While the tofu is pressing, remove the mushroom stems and gently rinse the caps to remove any dirt. In a small bowl, mix together 3 tablespoons of the soy sauce and 3 teaspoons of the sesame oil. Brush the mushrooms on both sides with the mixture. Place the caps, gill side up, in the prepared baking pan. When you are ready to grate the tofu, discard the liquid that has accumulated in the bowl. Grate the tofu and transfer it to a large bowl. Add the bell peppers, scallions, peanut butter, ginger, chili paste or chili sauce, if using, the remaining soy sauce, and the remaining 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil and mix thoroughly. Mound one quarter of the filling on each mushroom, pressing with your fingers to compact. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the mushrooms release juice and the filling is firm and slightly browned. While the mushrooms bake, prepare the Simple Sweet and Sour Sauce.
