Combine all of the glaze ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes. Strain the pan contents and discard the solids. Reduce the liquid to about ½ cup. Refrigerate if you do this in advance. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the ham on a rack in a disposable aluminum pan. Cut shallow gashes in a crisscross pattern across the top half of the ham. Spoon just enough of the glaze over the ham to completely wet the surface. Combine the brown sugar and mustard together and pat it all over the ham. Pour ½ cup of water into the pan. Bake the ham, spooning some of the remaining glaze over it every 15 minutes until the glaze is all used up. Try to get some glaze on all parts of the ham. Add more water to the pan when it dries up. Continue baking for a total of 3½-4 hours, or until the ham reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees on a meat thermometer. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 30 minutes before carving.
