Season steak with the salt and pepper to taste. Grill, saute or broil to medium-rare, about 31/2 minutes per side. Remove from heat; let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile for the vinaigrette, whisk the vinegar, mustard and salt in a small bowl. Whisk in a few drops of oil to form an emulsion. Continue whisking while adding remaining oil in a slow, steady stream; whisk in honey. Toss greens with vinaigrette. Combine salsa ingredients in a medium bowl; set aside. Divide dressed greens among plates; mound salsa in center. Slice steak on the diagonal into thin strips; fan out across top of salsa.
