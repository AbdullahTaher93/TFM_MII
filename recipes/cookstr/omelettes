Beat the eggs lightly, pour over two tablespoons of hot, but not browned, melted butter in a non-stick pan. Move the cooked egg at the edges to the center of the pan, working counterclockwise. When most of the egg is congealed and almost cooked, flip the omelette to finish the raw side, top with filling, and roll onto a warm plate. Serve with hash browns or black beans and salsa fresca.
