Combine everything but the reserved scallion greens, olive oil, and cilantro in a food processor and puree until mostly smooth but still slightly chunky. Taste for seasoning and correct. Pour the soup into a bowl and whisk in the olive oil by hand. Cover the soup and chill at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. Whisk again before serving, and check the seasonings. Mince the firm green parts of the scallions and mix with the cilantro. Scatter some of the minced greens over each serving.
