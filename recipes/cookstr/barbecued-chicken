For the chicken: Rinse the chicken halves in cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Place the chicken in a large bowl or baking dish, coat with the Zesty Italian Dressing, and dust with Neely’s Barbecue Seasoning. For best results, allow the chicken to marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Thirty minutes before you’re ready to cook the chicken, take it out of the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature, then preheat the grill to 250°F, preferably over hickory and charcoal. Place the chicken halves on the grill, cavity-side up. Cover the grill, and cook for about 50 minutes. Flip the chicken over, and cook until it turns golden brown, and the wing and drumstick become very tender and pull easily away at the joints, another 15 to 20 minutes. Brush the chicken with Neely’s Barbecue Sauce during the last 5 minutes of cooking, and serve with additional sauce.
