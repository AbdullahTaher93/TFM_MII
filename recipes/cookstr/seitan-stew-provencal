Prepare the seasoned coating mixture by combining all the coating-mix ingredients in a medium bowl. Roll the seitan in the coating mix, pressing the mixture into the cubes. Set the coated cubes aside. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the seitan cubes and brown them well on all sides (about 15 minutes). To the browned cubes, add the garlic, onion, celery, carrots, turnip, and water. Cover the pot and allow the stew to reach a low boil. When the ingredients come to a boil, reduce the heat to low and add the tomatoes, beans, olives, wine, and bay leaves. Simmer until the carrots are tender (about 20 minutes). Combine the soy sauce with the starch water, then slowly add it to the stew, stirring to keep the sauce smooth. Continue to simmer the stew, stirring as it thickens (about 5-8 minutes). Add more water as needed. Just before serving, add the fresh parsley.
