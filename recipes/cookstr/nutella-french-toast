Heat a panini or sandwich press according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Spread 2 pieces of bread with the Nutella. Top each piece with another piece of bread. Whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, confectioners’ sugar, and vanilla in a shallow bowl. Place one of the sandwiches in the bowl and then turn it to completely coat it with the egg mixture. Transfer to a platter. Let stand for a few seconds. Put the sandwiches on the press, pull the top down, and cook until they are golden and crisp, 4 to 6 minutes, depending on how hot your machine is. Carefully remove from the press, dust with confectioners’ sugar, and serve immediately.
