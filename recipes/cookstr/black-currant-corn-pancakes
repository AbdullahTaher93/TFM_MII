Place a skillet over medium-low heat and spread oil on it if necessary to prevent sticking. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, the 1 tablespoon of oil, the egg, and the vanilla extract. Stir in the flour until any dry lumps disappear. Fold in the corn and berries. There is no need to allow frozen ingredients to thaw beforehand if you make relatively thin cakes. Pour batter to make conventional-sized cakes or one large, pan-sized cake that will equal an individual serving. Flip when the bottoms are golden brown, then cook the top side. Serve with syrup and butter or toppings of your choice.
