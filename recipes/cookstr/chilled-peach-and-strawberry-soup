In a heavy saucepan, combine the peaches, cranberry juice, peach nectar, water, strawberries, lime zest and juice, honey, and cinnamon stick and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the peaches are soft and mushy. Remove from the heat. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender until smooth. Set aside to cool. Cover and chill for at least 4 hours before serving.
