Place the red beans in a bowl, cover with cold water, and let sit overnight. The next morning, put the beans in a medium pan and add enough water so that the water level is about an inch above the beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for about an hour. Press the beans and the liquid through a sieve into a heavy skillet. Turn the heat up high and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Be careful when stirring, because the mixture will get very thick and sputter. Add the sugar and salt and continue cooking for another 10 minutes, until the mixture gets thick. Set aside to cool. If youâ€™re not using it right away, place in a glass jar and refrigerate for up to a week.
