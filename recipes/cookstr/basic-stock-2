If desired, you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350°F until thoroughly browned. Then use them to make your basic stock. (When you brown the bones and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes on the surface, which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color when it dissolves in the stock water.) Always start with cold water—enough to cover the other stock ingredients. Place all ingredients in a stock pot or a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer at least 4 hours, preferably 8 (unless directed otherwise in a recipe), replenishing the water as needed to keep about 1 quart of liquid in the pan. The pot may be uncovered or set a lid on it askew. Strain, cool and refrigerate until ready to use.
