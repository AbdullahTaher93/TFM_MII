Sort through the peas, remove any chaff or small stones, and rinse them well; then cover them with water and leave them to soak at least 2 hours ahead of time so that the peas will not continue to absorb liquid and thicken the sauce once it is made. Pour off the soaking water, and add 3 cups fresh water and the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil; then simmer until the peas are completely soft and have fallen apart, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly; then blend to make a smooth puree. Measure the amount of puree, and add water to bring it up to 3½ cups. While the peas are cooking, prepare the vegetables. Plunge the tomatoes into boiling water for a count of 10 seconds; then place them in a bowl of cold water. Remove the peels; then halve them and gently squeeze out the seeds. Cut them into large pieces. Cut the eggplant into 1-inch cubes, and cut the zucchini and the carrots into batons or sticks about 1½ inches long. Whatever shapes you make, keep them large enough so that after cooking they will have a clear, distinct appearance on the plate. When you are ready to cook the stew, have the dried spices ready on the stove, and a lid handy, in case the mustard seeds splatter and pop. Heat the clarified butter in a large wide skillet, and when it is hot, add the mustard seeds. Cook a brief 5 seconds or so, until the mustard seeds turn grayish and begin to explode; then add the cumin seeds, and after another 5 seconds the onion. Saute for one minute over high heat; then add the tomatoes and the eggplant. Cook 2 or 3 minutes before adding the cauliflower and the carrots. Stir everything together; then add the pureed yellow peas. Add the salt, stir, and cook over medium-low heat until the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Add the zucchini during the last 10 minutes, so that it will stay bright and somewhat firm. Taste again for salt, and add more if necessary. Serve the vegetables and dal garnished with the fresh cilantro.
