Preheat the oven to 300Â°F. Generously spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Break the eggs into a large bowl and beat well with a fork or whisk. Add the vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and 1/3 cup sugar, and beat until blended. Add the nuts and stir until they are thoroughly moistened. Let stand 5 minutes. Transfer the nuts, plus any remaining liquid, to the prepared baking sheet, and push together into a single layer, so the nuts are touching, but not piled vertically. (It should be one large, flat mass.) Bake on the center rack of the oven for 15 minutes, then use a spatula to scrape the nuts and their coating from the bottom of the baking sheet, and rearrange everything, so nothing is sticking and the nuts get moved around a bit. This helps them cook evenly. Bake another 15 minutes, then remove from the oven. If your taste runs sweet, you can sprinkle the nuts with 1 to 2 teaspoons additional sugar while they are still hot and on the baking sheet. Let the nuts cool completely on the baking sheet, then transfer them to clean jars with tight-fitting lids for storage. (You can also just transfer them to bowls for instant eating.)
