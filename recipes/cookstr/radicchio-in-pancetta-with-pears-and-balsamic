Cut the heads of radicchio lengthwise in half and lay cut side up on the cutting board. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle each half with a bit of olive oil. Unroll the slices of pancetta. Tightly wrap each radicchio half in a slice of pancetta. Place the radicchio on a plate and refrigerate for 20 minutes (this will help the pancetta adhere to the radicchio). Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for indirect grilling. Place the radicchio cut side down on the cooler part of the grill, with the stem ends toward the fire. Cook slowly for 10 to 15 minutes, turning once, until the radicchio softens and the tips of the leaves are golden brown. Meanwhile, core the pears and slice into very thin wedges. Set aside. Move the radicchio to the hot part of the grill and cook for about 1 minute, turning once, to crisp the pancetta. Be careful not to let the flames lick up too high; if the radicchio begins to char, remove it from the grill. Arrange the radicchio cut side up on a platter and drizzle with balsamic vinegar. Lay a couple of slices of pear over each one and serve immediately.
