Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. In a small saucepan, cook the honey, brown sugar, and vanilla over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar melts. In a medium bowl, combine the oats, sunflower seeds, almonds, walnuts, and coconut. Add the sugar mixture and toss until the granola is evenly coated. Lightly grease a baking sheet with the vegetable oil spray or butter. Spread out the mixture in an even layer and bake for 25 minutes, stirring with a long-handled wooden spoon once or twice during this time. Remove the granola from the oven, and let it cool to room temperature in the pan. Break the granola into chunks and store in a sealed plastic bag or lidded container for up to 2 weeks.
