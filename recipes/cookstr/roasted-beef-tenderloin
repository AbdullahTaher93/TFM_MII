Preheat the oven to 375Â° F. Spread the bread cubes in a single even layer on a baking sheet. Bake until very crispy and dry, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning and to make sure all the sides are toasted. Remove and let cool. Working in small batches, place the cooled bread cubes in a food processor and pulse to fine crumbs. Shake all the crumbs through a mesh strainer or sieve into a large bowl. This will filter out the larger pieces, making all the crumbs of uniform size. Add the garlic, thyme, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Using the palms of your hands, rub all of the ingredients together. The result should be very uniform, highly flavored bread crumbs.
