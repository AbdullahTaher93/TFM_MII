In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the vegetable oil for about 30 seconds, then add the rice. Stir for 30 seconds. Add the salt and 3 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, or until the rice is fluffy. To make a’hata (crispy rice), if desired, reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting and let the rice cook until the rice at the bottom of the saucepan begins to transform into a toasted crust, about 1 hour. Monitor the a’hata closely so that the rice doesn’t burn.
