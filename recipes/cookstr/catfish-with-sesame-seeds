Wash and pat the fish with dry paper towels. Cut the catfish diagonally into 1-inch strips. In a shallow pan, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt and pepper to taste. Lightly dredge the fish in the cornmeal mixture. Melt the lard in a large skillet and pan-fry the catfish until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle the fish with the toasted sesame seeds. Serve with White Remoulade.
