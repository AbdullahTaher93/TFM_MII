Equipment: Have ready a heavy roasting pan large enough to hold the turkey. Place a plastic oven bag inside a second one to create a double thickness (see Cookâ€™s Note); then place these bags, open wide, in the roasting an. Remove the turkey from its wrapping. Remove the neck and bag of giblets from the main and neck cavities of the bird. Store separately in the refrigerator for making gravy. If using the Apple Cider Brine, stuff the main cavity of the turkey with the orange quarters at this point. Fold back the top third of the bags, making a collar (this helps to keep the top of the bag open). Place the turkey inside the double-thick bags, stand it upright, unfold the top of the bag, and pour the Juniper Brne or Apple Cider Brine over the bird. Add an additional 2 cups of cold water. Draw up the top of the inner bag, squeezing out as much air as possible; then secure it closed with a twist tie. Do the same for the outer bag. Place the turkey, breast-side down, in the roasting pan and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. Turn the turkey 3 or 4 times while it is brining. Just prior to roasting, remove the turkey from the brine. Discard the bags, brine, and any cured herbs or spices remainingon the bird Discard the oranges and ginger if using the Apple Cider Brine. Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. The turkey is now ready to be roasted.
