Place the bacon on a rack in a shallow baking pan. Roast, uncovered, in a 325°F (160°C) oven for 1 hour. In a measuring cup, stir together maple syrup, flour, mustard, lemon juice and cloves. Spread half of the mixture over the roast, increase oven temperature to 425°F (220°C) and roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the centre registers 130°F (55°C), about 20 to 30 minutes longer, basting with the remaining maple syrup mixture after 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; tent with foil and let stand for 10 minutes before thinly slicing.
