To make the batter, combine the flour and salt in a bowl and make a well in the center. Add the eggs to the well with ½ cup of the milk. Whisk, gradually beating in the remaining milk, until smooth. Let stand for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Pour the oil into a 13 × 9in (33 × 23cm) baking dish. Add the sausages and turn to coat in the oil. Bake for 5-10 minutes, until they are just colored and the fat is very hot. Reduce the temperature to 400°F (200°C). Carefully pour the batter around the sausages. Continue baking for 30 minutes more, or until the batter is golden and crisp. Serve hot.
