Nestle a scallop in the curve of each shrimp. Use 2 short bamboo skewers to secure the shrimp to the scallop. Set aside. Pour the tamari into a metal bowl set over a small saucepan with about 2 inches of simmering water. Cook over medium-high heat for 30 to 40 minutes, or until reduced by half and slightly thickened. A salt crust will form on top of the reducing tamari. Do not stir the crust into the tamari. Instead, carefully pour the tamari from the pan, leaving the salt crust behind. This will keep the tamari from being too salty. Heat a medium saut√© pan or skillet over medium heat until hot. Season each seafood skewer lightly with pepper and then brush lightly first with the canola oil and then with the tamari reduction. Sear the skewers for about 2 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned. To serve, spoon a little tamari into the center of each of 4 plates. Place 2 of the skewers on the sauce and garnish with the shiso leaves. Do not use too much of the tamari reduction; it's very salty.
