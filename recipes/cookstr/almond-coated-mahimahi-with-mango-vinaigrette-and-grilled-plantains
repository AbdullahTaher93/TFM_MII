In a small bowl, combine the mangoes, ¼ cup olive oil, lime juice, zest, salt, and pepper. Chill until ready to use. Combine the almonds and peppercorns on a sheet of wax paper. Brush the fish with a little oil and season with salt on both sides. Roll the fish in the almond mixture. Peel and cut the plantains into long diagonal slices, about ¼ inch thick. Brush with oil. Place the fish on an oiled grill over hot coals in the center of the grill and the plantains on the outer edge where it is not as hot. Grill the fish about 5 minutes per side, or just until the fish is firm and opaque and the almonds are deep brown. Grill the plantains 3 to 4 minutes per side, brushing with oil if necessary, until they are scored and soft. Place a radicchio leaf cup on each plate and spoon in the vinaigrette. Arrange equal portions of fish and plantains on the plates and garnish with parsley or cilantro.
