Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Wash and clean the vegetables. Toss all the vegetables with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, marjoram and garlic. Set tender vegetables such as asparagus and red peppers aside. In a shallow baking dish, arrange vegetables so they are in a single layer. Roast 20 minutes and stir. Add the tender vegetables and continue to roast 10 minutes. Serve hot.
