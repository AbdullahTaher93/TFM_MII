Heat a panini or sandwich press according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Split each roll in half. Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Combine the tuna and capers in a medium bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the tuna. Mix well to combine. Arrange the avocado slices on the bottom half of each roll. Arrange the tuna on top of the avocado. Lay the mozzarella slices on top of the avocado. Top the sandwiches with the top halves of the rolls. Put the sandwiches on the press, pull the top down, and cook until they are browned and crisp and the cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes, depending on how hot your machine is. Carefully remove from the press and serve immediately.
