Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly oil an 8 × 4in (20 × 10cm) loaf pan. Mix together the ground beef, pork, onion, bread crumbs, parsley, mustard, and paprika and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the beaten egg and mix thoroughly. Evenly spread half of the mixture in the pan. Arrange the hard-boiled eggs down the center, then top with the remaining meat mixture and smooth the top. Cover the loaf pan with aluminum foil. Bake for about 50 minutes, until firm. Let stand for 10 minutes before turning out on to a warmed platter. To make the sauce, mix the sour cream, pickles, capers, and parsley. Serve the meat loaf cut into slices, with the sauce spooned over and extra on the side.
