Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with foil. Lightly toast the English muffins either in a toaster or in the oven on the baking sheet. Arrange the toasted muffin halves on the baking sheet. Place a slice of ham or salmon on the cut side of each. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Pile the whites on each muffin, covering it (and the ham or salmon) completely. Use the back of a spoon to make a depression in the center of each. Place a yolk in each depression. Place in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, until the whites are lightly browned and the yolks are just set. Sprinkle with a little sea salt and pepper and serve immediately.
