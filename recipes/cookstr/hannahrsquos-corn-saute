Cover a microwave-safe plate with paper towels. Place the bacon on the plate, cover with another paper towel, and microwave on high power until just crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside. Place the corn in a colander and rinse it with warm water to partially defrost. Set aside to drain well. Combine the oil and butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. While the oil mixture is heating, peel and coarsely chop the onion, adding it to the skillet as you chop. Cut the zucchini into bite-size pieces. Add the zucchini to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the corn and herbes de Provence and stir to mix well. Cover and steam until heated through, about 4 minutes. Crumble the bacon over the vegetables and toss to mix well. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve at once.
