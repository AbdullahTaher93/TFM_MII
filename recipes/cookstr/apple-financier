Place the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat and slowly melt. Cook gently until the milk solids turn golden brown and the butter is amber-colored and smells nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. Sift the confectioners’ sugar, almond flour, flour, and salt into the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a wire whip attachment, or use a handheld electric beater. Add the egg whites and mix on low speed for a minute or two to just combine. Add the vanilla and slowly drizzle in the cooled brown butter, blending until smooth. Scrape the batter into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Butter and flour four or eight 4-ounce ramekins and place them on a sheet pan. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip (or no tip at all) and pipe into the prepared ramekins, filling to just below the rim. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden and springy to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the ramekins for 2 minutes before inverting onto dessert plates. Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. When the foam subsides, add the apples, tossing to coat. Sprinkle in the sugar and sauté until the apples soften slightly and the sugar begins to caramelize. Add a pinch of salt to balance out the sweetness. Add the brandy and continue to cook until the liquid has reduced and is syrupy, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
