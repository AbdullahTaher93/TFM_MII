In a shallow bowl, combine the drained chiles, garlic, honey, ground cinnamon, and ground chile. Add enough chipotle cooking liquid to make a thick paste. Marinate for 10 to 15 minutes. Preheat the grill, stovetop grill, or a large, heavy, seasoned skillet to medium high. Grill the chops for 8 minutes per side. At the same time and on the same surface, grill the jicama until it is slightly edged with brown on each side. To serve, top each chop with a cinnamon stick. Overlap each chop with a slice of the grilled jicama.
