Mix the tuna, soybeans, broccoli, scallions, red pepper, basil, and parsley together in a serving bowl. In a small bowl, mix the oil and vinegar. Spear the garlic clove on a fork and use the fork to whisk the oil and vinegar together until they begin to emulsify. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk again with the garlic clove and pour over the salad, tossing well to combine.
