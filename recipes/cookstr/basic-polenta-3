In a large saucepan, bring the water to a rapid boil over high heat. Add the kosher salt, then slowly pour in the polenta while stirring constantly with a long-handled wooden spoon or a whisk. Reduce the heat to medium-low and, using the wooden spoon or whisk, stir constantly in the same direction to prevent lumps from forming and to keep the boiling temperature constant. This is important if the polenta is to become properly soft and creamy. The polenta is cooked when it is so thick that it begins to resist stirring and pulls away from the sides of the pan with the spoon or whisk, usually after about 30 minutes. If the polenta is quite thick but still not pulling away easily from the pan, add a little more boiling water and continue to stir until it is ready. Pour into a warmed serving dish. Grilled or Fried Polenta: As soon as the polenta is cooked, pour it onto an oiled marble slab, cutting board, or other flat work surface, and use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly about Â¼ inch thick. Dip the spatula into a glass of cold water as you work to prevent the polenta from sticking to it. Permit the polenta to set fully, about 30 minutes. Use a knife or cake spatula to cut it into squares about the size of bread slices or into the size or shape desired. Brush the pieces lightly on both sides with olive oil. Run them under a broiler until they are lightly charred or blistered on both sides or fry them on both sides in olive oil or butter. Polenta can also be poured into a greased mold to set. To cut, turn it out onto a work surface and slice it with nylon thread, fishing line, or unflavored dental floss. The slices can be grilled or fried in olive oil or butter.
