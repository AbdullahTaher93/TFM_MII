Place one rack in the center of the oven and one in the bottom third. Heat to 500°F (260°C; highest gas mark; #9 British regulo). Place the oxtails in two medium roasting pans. Place one pan on each rack. Roast for 15 minutes. Turn the pieces over and switch the pan positions in the oven. Roast for 15 more minutes. Remove the pans from the oven and transfer the oxtails to a tall narrow stockpot. Pour or spoon off the excess fat from the roasting pans. Put one pan on top of the stove over high heat. Add 1 cup (250 ml) water and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom and sides of the pan with a wooden spoon. Let reduce by half. Pour this liquid over the oxtails in the stockpot. Repeat with the second pan. Pour 10 cups (25 l) water over the bones. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer very gently, skimming as necessary (see Notes), for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Remove the oxtails. As soon as they are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from bones and reserve. Return the bones to pot. Add the remaining water. Return to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 8 hours, skimming as necessary. Add additional water as necessary to keep the bones covered. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the bones. Skim the fat. Cool to room temperature, and refrigerate for 3 hours. Remove the fat from the top of the and the sediment from the bottom (see Notes). Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze.
