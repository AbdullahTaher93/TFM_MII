In a large bowl or casserole combine all but the chicken and garnishes. Remove the skin and excess fat from the chicken breasts but leave the bones. Add the chicken to the marinade and coat each piece well. Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Remove chicken pieces from marinade and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake chicken for about 45 minutes or until done, basting often with remaining marinade. Chicken may also be cooked in a rotisserie oven or grilled over very low heat until cooked through. Serve chicken on a platter surrounded by garnishes.
