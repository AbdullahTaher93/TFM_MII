Stir yogurt in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Stir in sugar, salt and pepper. Cover and chill well before serving. (Can be refrigerated for up to 8 hours.) In a separate bowl, toss together lemon juice and apples. Mix in cabbage. Cover and refrigerate until chilled or for up to 3 hours. Just before serving, pour yogurt into cabbage mixture. Add peanuts and toss to mix well. In a small saucepan, heat oil over high heat until almost smoking. Add mustard seeds and cover immediately. When seeds stop popping within a few seconds, pour over top of cabbage. Toss and serve immediately.
