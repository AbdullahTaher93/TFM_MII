Pour the coconut milk into a 2-cup measure; whisk to blend the solid coconut cream with the liquid coconut milk. Add enough half-and-half to equal 2 cups. Whisk to blend. Combine the coconut milk mixture, sugar, and salt in a deep saucepan; heat to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring to prevent scorching. Ladle out 1 cup and reserve to serve as a sauce. Add the rice to the saucepan; heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low; cook, stirring often to prevent sticking and adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a steady simmer, until the pudding is very thick, about 10 minutes or more depending on the rice. Add more cream, if needed. Transfer to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. Cut the mangoes just to the left and the right of the flat center pits. Peel the skin from the two cheeks. Place the cut sides down and cut crosswise into Â½-inch-wide slices. To serve the pudding, spoon a mound onto each dessert plate. Fan the mango slices and arrange on the side of each plate. Sprinkle with toasted coconut and/or sesame seeds. Pass a pitcher of the reserved sweetened coconut milk mixture to drizzle on top of the pudding, if desired.
