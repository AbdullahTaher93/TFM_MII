Break the chocolate into chunks and put into a heavy-based saucepan over the lowest heat possible with all the other ingredients. When the chocolate has melted, take the pan off the heat and whisk vigorously to thicken the sauce. I just use one of my little hand whisks for this. Pour the blonde mocha sauce into a pitcher or glass measuring cup, cover the surface with a thin skin of plastic wrap and when cool, stick it into the fridge. When you are ready to pour it over the ice cream, take it out of the fridge, give it a good stir and use it straight from the pitcher.
