In a large stock pot, combine the chicken parts (and turkey winfs, if using) with 1 gallon (4 L) cold water. Bring to a boil, skimming off and discarding the white foam impurities that rise to the surface. Continue to simmer until the foam turns light brown and skim that away as well. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil again, skimming as necessary. Reduce the heat to a bare simmer and cook, partially covered, for 6 hours, or until the chicken meat falls easily off the bones. Strain through a sieve or china cap into a large, stainless steel bowl or another pot, discarding the solids. In hot weather, place the strained stock into a sink full of ice mixed with water and cool for about 1 hour. In cool weather, cool at room temperature. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, remove and discard any fat from the surface. If desired, freeze the stock at this point.
