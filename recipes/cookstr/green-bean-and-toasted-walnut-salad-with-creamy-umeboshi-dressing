In a small bowl, prepare the dressing by adding the soymilk, a little at a time, to the umeboshi paste. Mix well with a fork or whisk. Add the oil, brown rice vinegar, dill, and thyme, and continue to mix. Cover and refrigerate the dressing until ready to use. While stirring them constantly, toast the walnuts in a cast iron frying pan over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or bake them in a 350Â°F oven for 15 minutes. Allow the walnuts to cool before adding them, along with the onion slices, to the umeboshi dressing. Steam the beans until they are just tender and bright green in color. Drain them in a colander, then plunge them into cold water to stop the cooking and set the bright color. Drain the beans and pat them dry. Place the beans and half the seitan strips in a bowl, add the dressing, and toss lightly. Arrange the salad on a platter and top with the remaining seitan strips.
