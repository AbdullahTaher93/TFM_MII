1 Combine the quinoa and bouillon cube with 2Â½ cups water in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer gently for 10 minutes. 2 Stir in the corn, scallions, and cumin, and continue to cook, still covered, until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is puffy, about 5 minutes longer. 3 Remove from the heat and stir in the fresh herb and oil. Season with salt and pepper, then serve.
