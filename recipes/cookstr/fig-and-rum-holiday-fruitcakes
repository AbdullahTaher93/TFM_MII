In a small bowl, combine the almonds, figs, rum, and orange zest. Cover and macerate at room temperature overnight. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a jumbo-size cupcake pan with paper liners. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer). Cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light. Add the eggs and mix until well blended. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and mix just until blended. Stir in fig and rum mixture. Fill the lined cupcake pan three-quarters full with the batter. Bake the cupcakes 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out with a fine crumb. Remove the pan from the oven. Let the cupcakes cool in the pan on a wire rack.
