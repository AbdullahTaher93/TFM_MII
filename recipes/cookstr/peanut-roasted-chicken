Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease the rack of a small roasting pan. Slip your fingers under the chicken’s skin, and loosen it, being careful not to tear it. Massage the oil into the flesh and inside the cavity. Rub the butter over the chicken’s skin. Salt and pepper the chicken generously inside and out. Fill the cavity with the onion and ¼ cup of the peanuts. Place the chicken on the rack in the roasting pan, breast up, and roast it for 15 minutes. Turn the chicken on one side, add the garlic cloves to the pan, and baste the chicken with a little stock. Reduce the heat to 350°F. and cook the bird 15 minutes more. Turn the chicken on its other side, add the remaining ¼ cup of peanuts to the pan, and baste again. Cook 15 minutes longer, and turn the bird back-side up. Pour the wine or additional stock over it, and roast it for another 15 minutes. Turn the chicken breast up again, and baste it with the pan juices and a little more stock. After 15 more minutes, the chicken should be golden brown with a, crispy skin. The total cooking time is 1¼ hours. Remove the chicken from the oven. Spoon out the onion and peanuts from its cavity; and add them to the roasting pan. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter, cover it with a foil tent, and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes before carving it. Pour the contents of the roasting pan and the wine or remaining stock into a blender or food processor, and purée. Strain the sauce, reheat it if needed, and serve it in a gravy boat along with the roast chicken.
