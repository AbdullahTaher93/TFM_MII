To make the meatballs, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a shallow casserole, and very slowly saute the garlic, onion, and bell pepper. Remove the vegetables to a bowl and wipe out the casserole. Cut the tomato in half crosswise and holding it over the bowl, grate the tomato with a coarse grater down to the skin. Add to the bowl the meat, salt, a generous amount of pepper, 1 egg, and the bread crumbs. Work with your hands until well mixed, then shape into 1Â½-inch balls. In a dish, lightly beat the remaining 2 eggs. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the casserole. Dust the meatballs with flour, dip in the egg, then place directly in the hot pan. Saute over medium heat until browned on all sides and barely cooked through. Remove to a warm platter, leaving the oil in the casserole. To make the sauce, in the same oil (add a little more if necessary) saute the onion, garlic, and bell pepper until softened. Stir in the flour, then the tomato sauce, wine, broth, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Return the meatballs to the casserole, heat, and serve.
