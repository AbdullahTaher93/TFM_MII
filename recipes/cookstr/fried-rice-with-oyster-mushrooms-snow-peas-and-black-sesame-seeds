Break the eggs into a small bowl; add Â½ teaspoon each sesame oil and tamari. Beat gently with a fork or chopstick just to combine. Set aside. Heat a wok or large skillet, preferably nonstick, over high heat until hot enough to sizzle a drop of water upon contact. Add the peanut oil and a pinch of the scallion whites. When the scallions sizzle, add the remaining scallion whites; fry for 20 seconds, stirring with a flat wooden spatula or spoon. Add the ginger and the garlic; stir-fry for 10 seconds. Stir in the snow peas; cook for 20 seconds. Stir in the mushrooms; cook for 20 seconds. Add the rice; break up any clumps with the edge of the spatula mixing in the other ingredients. Press the rice against the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon tamari and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Continue heating the rice, lifting up sections with the spatula, and turning, pressing, and hacking at it with the side of the spatula, until all the ingredients are evenly mixed and coated with the seasonings, about 1 minute. Push the rice to one side or up the sides of the pan to make an open space. Add the eggs and fry until partially set, about 30 seconds. Stir into the rice until blended. Sprinkle the fried rice with the scallion greens and sesame seeds. Spoon into a serving dish and serve at once. Let each person season the rice with extra tamari and sesame oil to taste.
