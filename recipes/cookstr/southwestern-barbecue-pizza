Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the tortillas on a baking sheet and bake for 3 minutes or until hot. Spread half the barbecue sauce on each tortilla, then top with half the vegetables or meat. Sprinkle with half the cheeses and onion. Bake for 8 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Sprinkle chile, if using, and serve.
