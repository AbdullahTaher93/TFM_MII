In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Using your fingertips, rub in the butter. Add just enough water to achieve a stiff, smooth dough. Shape the cakes into 2-inch-wide discs. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until it is very hot. Fry the cakes in the hot oil until they are brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes.
