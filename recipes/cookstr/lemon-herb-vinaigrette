Combine the mix of herbs, garlic, and green onion in a food processor. Pulse 3 or 4 times to blend slightly. Add one cup of oil and blend. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and blend again. Add the broth with the machine running, then add the remaining oil slowly. Add Â¼ cup of juice, one teaspoon of salt, a few grinds of fresh pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Blend and taste. Add more lemon and salt and pepper if needed. This should be a nice light emulsion. Transfer to a small double boiler to warm gently. Makes about 3 to 4 cups. Keeps two weeks in the fridge, but loses its bright green color when heated.
