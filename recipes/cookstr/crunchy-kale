Wash the kale leaves and dry thoroughly. Strip away any heavy ribs and chop the leaves roughly. You should have about 2 packed cups. Heat the olive oil in a saut√© pan and add the garlic cloves, cooking for a couple of minutes. Remove the garlic cloves and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the chopped kale and same until wilted and slightly crunchy, about 7 minutes. Serve immediately.
