Beat the eggs with the sugar till pale and creamy. Then beat in the oil, honey, brandy, and coffee. Mix the baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and orange zest with the flour. Add gradually to the egg-and-honey mixture, beating vigorously to a smooth batter. Dust the golden raisins and the walnuts or almonds with flour to prevent them from dropping to the bottom of the cake, and stir them into the batter. Line a 9-inch (24-cm) pan with greaseproof paper or with foil, brushed with oil and dusted with flour, and pour in the batter. Or divide between 2 9-by-5-inch (24-by-13-cm) loaf pans. Bake the large cake in a preheated 350°F (180°C) oven for 1¼ hours, or longer, until firm and brown on top, and the smaller ones for 1 hour.
