Preheat the oven to 450°F. In a small bowl, combine the orange juice, honey, vinegar, mustard, chile pepper, oil, garlic, salt, cumin, and cinnamon. Put the pork in a roasting pan that can easily be covered and coat the pork completely with the sauce. Cover with a lid or foil. Reduce oven temperature to 200°F. Roast the pork, without opening the door, for 5 hours. Check to see if it is falling-apart tender, and if not, cover and roast for about 30 minutes longer, or until it is tender. Sprinkle green onions as a garnish.
