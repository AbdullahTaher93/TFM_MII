Set a large pasta pot filled with water over high heat. When the water boils, add 1 tablespoon salt. Add the pasta and cook until it is al dente. Drain in a colander, reserving ½ cup of the pasta cooking liquid. Set the pasta aside, shaking it from time to time to keep it from sticking. In a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. After a minute, add the garlic, red pepper flakes, olives, and capers, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring, to flavor the oil. Carefully add the vermouth, stirring to loosen any bits clinging to the pan. Add the tomatoes with juice and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. If the sauce is dry, add a touch of the reserved pasta cooking water. Add the basil, prawns, lemon zest, and reserved pasta, and cook, tossing, for 2 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with the goat cheese and basil leaves.
