Fill a large pot or Dutch oven halfway with water. Add the spices, bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to medium. Add the shrimp and simmer for 2 or 3 minutes, or until they turn pink. Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon or drain in a colander. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl, add some lemon wedges, then peel and eat!
