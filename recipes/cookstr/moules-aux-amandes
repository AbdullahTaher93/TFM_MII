Make the stuffing: Pound the garlic and parsley together, then add the softened butter. Soak the bread-crumbs in the white wine until soft and squeeze them dry; add them to the garlic mixture. Mix in the almonds and season, working everything together into a paste. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Clean and scrape the mussels under running water. Put them into a large saucepan with a lid and shake them over a brisk heat until they have opened. Allow them to cool a little and then remove the top shells. Arrange the mussels on a large dish or two smaller ones and put a little almond mixture onto each mussel. Bake the mussels for 5 or 6 minutes.
