In a small saucepan, combine the garlic cloves and olive oil and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the garlic turns gorcen brown, 10 to 15 minutes. (Do not let the garlic get too dark because the oil with have a bitter taste.) Let cool and then add the red pepper flakes. Infuse for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Refrigerate in a covered container.
