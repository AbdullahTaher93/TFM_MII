Heat the ghee in a small saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in the cardamom pods, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks, and let them sizzle, crackle, and expand a bit, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully pour in the tomato sauce (stand back, as it will splatter). Sprinkle in the chiles and stir to blend. Lower the heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until an oily layer forms on the surface and around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes. The sauce will be deep red, thanks to the Kashmiri chiles. Discard the cardamom, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks, and let the sauce cool completely. Store the sauce in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator, where it will keep for up to 2 weeks, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
