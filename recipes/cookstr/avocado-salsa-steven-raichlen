Preheat the grill to high. Place the tomatillos on the grate and grill, until lightly browned on all sides and soft, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Or bring 2 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Add the tomatillos and simmer, covered, until soft, about 4 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking. Drain the tomatillos, reserving the cooking liquid. Transfer the tomatillos to a food processor and process to a coarse purée. Add the chilies, cilantro, onion, garlic, lime juice, sugar, salt, and pepper and process just to mix. The mixture should be soupy; if too thick, add a few tablespoons of water or tomatillo cooking liquid. Add the avocado and process just to mix. Don’t overprocess; the avocado should remain in small pieces. Correct the seasoning, adding salt or lime juice; the salsa should be highly seasoned. Serve within 1 to 2 hours of making.
