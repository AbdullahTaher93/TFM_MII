First, oil a tortilla round for each pizza you plan to make: sprinkle olive oil on a sturdy cookie sheet or jelly roll pan, and press the tortillas in the oil on the tray to coat them well on one side, and then turn them over, so they are oiled on the other side. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Sprinkle 1½ tablespoons of Parmesan cheese on the oiled tortilla and arrange the shrimp and clams on top. (You can reserve the clam juice to use in a fish soup or to make a drink. My friend Craig Claiborne used to love “bullshots”, which were drinks made with fresh clam juice and vodka.) Add the garlic (this is a lot of garlic, but it is needed!), the Herbes de Provence, the scallions, and the jalapeño, if you like, a dash of Tabasco for heat. Sprinkle on another 1½ tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, and then evenly drizzle the olive oil on top. Bake for 5 to 6 minutes, or until crusty. Let rest for a minute or so, and sprinkle with the parsley. Cut into 8 wedges, and serve.
