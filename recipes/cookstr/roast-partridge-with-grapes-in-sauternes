To start the sauce, combine the wine and grapes and let stand for at least 1 hour. Cut the breasts off the partridges. Season with salt and pepper. For each breast, place a slice of butter and a sage leaf on the under side, and wrap in 1 slice of bacon. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the breasts and cook, turning once, about 3 minutes, until browned on both sides. Place in an oiled roasting pan, skin side up; set aside. Leave any fat in the pan. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). To continue the sauce, add the shallots to the frying pan and cook about 2 minutes, until softened. Strain the wine into the pan, reserving the grapes. Bring to a boil and cook to reduce to 1/3 cup. Stir in the stock and boil until reduced again to 1/3 cup. Add the grapes and cook for 1 minute; set aside. Roast the breasts for 12 minutes, turning once. Before serving, bring the sauce back to a simmer. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with the sauce.
