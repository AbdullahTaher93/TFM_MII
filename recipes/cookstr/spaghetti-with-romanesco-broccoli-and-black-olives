Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan and add the onion. Cook over low heat until soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Core the cauliflowers and cut into bite-size florets. Add the cauliflower, ¾ cup water, and a touch of salt to the onion; cook at a simmer until the florets are tender but hold their shape. Stir in the olives and simmer until hot. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Drain. Toss the pasta with the sauce. Season with pepper to taste. Sprinkle about ¼ cup pecorino over the pasta and gently toss. Top with shavings of ricotta salata. Serve with additional grated pecorino at the table.
