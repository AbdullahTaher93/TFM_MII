• 1. Bring the water to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan. Add the rice, vanilla bean, and salt. Cook 10 minutes. • 2. Add the milk and cook over very low heat until the rice is tender, about 10 minutes. • 3. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly butter a 1½-quart shallow baking dish. • 4. In a small bowl, combine the cream, sugar, and eggs, then fold into the rice mixture. Remove the vanilla bean and pour the rice mixture into the buttered baking dish. Sprinkle with cinnamon. • 5. Place the baking dish into a larger baking pan in the oven. Pour boiling water into the larger baking pan to a depth of 1 inch. Bake 30 to 45 minutes, or until the pudding is firm and the top surface is golden brown. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Serve at room temperature or refrigerate, covered, to serve chilled.
