Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the garlic and cook until the cloves start to color. Add the sage and let the leaves sizzle for 10 seconds, then add the thinly sliced onions and salt and cook for 2 minutes. Add the water, cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the onions are quite soft, about 15 minutes. Uncover and cook until most of the liquid evaporates. Do not allow the onions to color. Let cool to room temperature. With a boning knife, carefully cut between the muscles to open up the shoulder so that it lies flat like a book. (You can also ask the butcher to do this for you.) Rub the surface with 1 tablespoon of the spice rub, then spread the cooled onions on top. Reshape the shoulder to enclose the onions, as if you were closing the book. Tie the pork lightly with kitchen string, taking care not to squeeze the onions out. Rub it all over with olive oil, then with the remaining 3 tablespoons spice rub. (You can refrigerate the pork overnight at this point, but bring it to room temperature before continuing.) Preheat the oven to 275Â°F. Line a roasting pan or heavy rimmed baking sheet with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Put the celery, carrots, and onion halves in the roasting pan to make a vegetable rack and top with the pork. Roast the pork until it is fork-tender, about 7 hours. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before removing the string. Discard the vegetables; transfer the pork to a platter. To serve, pull the roast apart into large chunks with a meat fork rather than carving it into neat slices.
