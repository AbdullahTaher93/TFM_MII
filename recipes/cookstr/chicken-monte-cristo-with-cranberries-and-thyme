1, In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Melt ½ tablespoons of the butter in a heavy 12-inch skillet (either cast-iron or non-stick) over medium heat. Dip 3 slices of the bread in the egg mixture and set in the skillet. Cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until browned, too, about 2 more minutes. Transfer to a large plate. 3 Melt the remaining 1½ tablespoons butter in the skillet, dip the remaining 3 slices of bread in the egg mixture and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Flip the bread and top with the cranberry sauce, chicken, ham, and Swiss. Spread the remaining slices of bread with the mustard and set on top. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, flipping once or twice and pressing down with a metal spatula to flatten the sandwiches, until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Cut in half and serve with a drizzle of the maple syrup.
