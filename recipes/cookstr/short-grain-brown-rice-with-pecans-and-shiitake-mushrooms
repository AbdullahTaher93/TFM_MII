Place the rice, water, and salt in a pressure cooker. Cover, place on the stovetop over high heat, and bring to pressure. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 45 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the pressure come down on its own. Place the shiitake in a bowl and cover with the hot water. Soak about 30 minutes to reconstitute. Transfer the mushrooms and soaking water to a medium pot and bring to a boil. Add the shoyu and mirin, reduce the heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes or until the mushrooms are tender. Remove the mushrooms from the pot and set aside to cool. Remove and discard the stems, and thinly slice the caps. Add the sliced shiitake and pecans to the cooked rice. Mix well and serve.
