Heat the olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions and leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook over very low heat until the flavors are blended, about 3 minutes. Add the curry powder and cook, stirring, until the curry aroma permeates the kitchen, another 2 minutes. Add the carrots, potatoes, squash, cauliflower, fennel, and green beans. Stir in the broth, honey, cloves, and cinnamon stick, raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Then add the chickpeas and simmer, stirring once or twice, to blend the flavors, another 10 minutes. Shortly before serving, stir in the cilantro and remove the cinnamon stick and cloves. Sprinkle with the chopped mint and serve.
