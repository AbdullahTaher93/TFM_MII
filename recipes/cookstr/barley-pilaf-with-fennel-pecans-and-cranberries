Set a heavy 2-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the pecans and toast until fragrant, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Tip the nuts out of the pot onto a chopping board. Add the barley flakes to the pot and toast, stirring frequently, until the flakes are aromatic, about 2 minutes. Push the barley aside. Add the butter to the empty side of the pot, and as it melts, stir in the fennel seeds. Let them sizzle in the butter for 30 seconds or so. Then stir the butter into the flakes. Stir in the broth, cranberries, and salt. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 5 minutes. If the flakes arenâ€™t tender and all of the liquid has been absorbed, stir in a few tablespoons of water, cover, and continue cooking until done. Chop the pecans coarsely and stir them into the barley. Add salt and pepper to taste.
