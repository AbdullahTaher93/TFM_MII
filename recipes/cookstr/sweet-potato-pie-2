Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the pie shell in the freezer while you prepare the praline. In a food processor, or in a bowl with a pastry blender, blend together the pecans, brown sugar, and butter. Remove the pie crust from the freezer, and spread the bottom of it with the praline. Bake for 12 minutes. Combine all the filling ingredients in a mixing bowl, and beat them together with a mixer until they are smooth and light. Pour the filling into the warm praline-filled crust. Arrange the pecan halves decoratively around the pie’s edge. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Bake the pie for 45 minutes, until the filling is set and slightly puffed. The top will sink back down when the pie cools. Serve the pie warm or at room temperature.
