Season the scallops with salt and pepper. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until shimmering and sauté the scallops until golden brown. For the onion confit: In a large skillet, heat the oil and butter over high heat until shimmering. Add tbe onions, sprinkle with the sugar, and cook without stirring for 5 minutes. Stir, then continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook 5 minutes more. Raise the heat to high, add ½ cup of stock, and boil for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and continue cooking 10 to 12 minutes, reducing the heat to medium-high as the onions begin to brown. Taste and add stock if the onions are too tart, or vinegar if they are too sweet. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm. To serve, place 2 tablespoons of onion confit on a plate and top with 1 scallop. Surround with a drizzle of beet oil and a drizzle of chive oil. Sprinkle with chopped chives. Variation: Substitute Basil Oil for chive oil.
