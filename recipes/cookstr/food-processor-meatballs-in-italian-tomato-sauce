To make the meatballs, preheat oven to 400°F. Place bread in food processor and process until crumbs form. Transfer crumbs to a large bowl. Add onion and garlic to food processor and process until finely chopped. Add remaining meatball ingredients and pulse to blend. Transfer to the bowl holding the crumbs and mix well with your hands. Form into 1¼-inch meatballs (about 20) and place on a baking sheet. Bake until browned, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm olive oil. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with juice, tomato sauce, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until flavors are blended, about 15 minutes. Add browned meatballs to sauce and simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes longer. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.
