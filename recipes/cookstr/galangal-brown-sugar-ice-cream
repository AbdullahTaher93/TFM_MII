Bring the cream, milk, galangal, and ¾ cup of the sugar to a simmer in a medium-large pot, stirring occasionally. Scrape the seeds out of the vanilla beans and add to the cream mixture. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining ½ cup sugar with the egg yolks. When the cream mixture is hot, whisk about ½ cup of it into the yolks. Add the tempered yolks to the remaining cream mixture and stir. Pour the hot cream through a fine sieve into a bowl set over an ice bath (to prevent the yolks from overcooking). Chill the ice cream base thoroughly and process in an ice-cream/gelato maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer to an ice cream container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving. Keeps for a month.
