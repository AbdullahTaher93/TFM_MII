To Make the Tacos: Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Place the fish in the pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Use a fork to check the fish. It should be flaky and milky white when done. Overcooking will cause it to be dry and tough. Divide the fish into five servings. Place one serving of fish on each tortilla. Squeeze the limes over the fish, add the avocado slices, and top with the shredded cabbage and Mango Lime Salsa. To Make the Salsa: Combine all of the ingredients except the salt and pepper in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with tortilla chips or on Caribbean Dream Fish Tacos.
