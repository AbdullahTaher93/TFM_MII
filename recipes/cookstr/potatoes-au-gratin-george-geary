Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). In work bowl fitted with shredding blade, shred cheese. Transfer to a bowl. In same work bowl fitted with slicing blade, slice potatoes. Transfer to a small bowl. In same work bowl, slice onions. In prepared baking dish, layer half of the potatoes and then onion slices. Top with remaining potatoes. Season with salt, black pepper and nutmeg. Set aside. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Whisk in flour, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in cheese all at once and continue stirring until cheese is slightly melted, 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese mixture over potatoes. Cover baking dish with foil. Bake in preheated oven until bubbling and a fork inserted into center is soft, 75 to 90 minutes. If you would like the top to have a nice brown look, remove the foil for the last 5 minutes of baking. Variation: Try different cheeses, such as Gouda or Edam, in place of the Cheddar.
