In a heavy saucepan, whisk together brown sugar, cream and butter. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in cocoa powder, whisking continuously. Remove from heat and whisk in rum. Let cool until thickened. Fudge sauce will become very thick as it cools. Spoon over pies or tarts.
