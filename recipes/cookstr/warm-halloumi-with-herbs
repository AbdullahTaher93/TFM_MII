Cut the halloumi cheese into ½ in (1cm) thick slices and lightly dust with flour. Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan over high heat. Fry the cheese slices for 2–3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Sprinkle with the thyme and lemon juice. Serve immediately with a little extra oil drizzled with oil and garnished with the lemon wedges.
