Place the fish bones in a large bowl and rinse under cold running water until the water in the bowl is clear. Drain well. In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the leek, onion, celery, and garlic, and saut√© until softened but not browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the thyme, parsley, peppercorns, and bones, cover, and cook over low heat for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and add the wine and water. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium and simmer 40 minutes, skimming occasionally. Strain through a fine strainer, pushing down on the solids to extract all the liquid. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate up to 1 week. After 3 days, bring to a boil. Then boil, skim, and cool every 2 days; or freeze.
