Early in the day, simmer balsamic vinegar in a small non-reactive saucepan with sugar and pepper until reduced by about half and slightly thickened for a glaze. Preheat grill to medium-high or 350 to 400 F. if not already hot. Place peach halves on grill, cut side down, and grill about 5 minutes or until flesh has slightly charred. Brush top sides with glaze and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Turn, brush with glaze and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to individual serving dishes and spoon any remaining glaze of tops. Serve with crumbled cheese on top.
