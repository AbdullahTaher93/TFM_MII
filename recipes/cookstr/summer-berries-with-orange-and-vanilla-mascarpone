Put your strawberries in a bowl. Sprinkle over 1 tablespoon of the sugar, the juice and zest of one of the oranges and half the seeds from the vanilla bean. Mix it all together gently then put it to one side while you get everything else ready. Mix the mascarpone with the remaining tablespoon of sugar, the juice and zest of the second orange and the remaining seeds from the vanilla bean. Stir it together really well. Spoon the mascarpone onto each plate. Use the back of a spoon to make a well in the center and then put the fruit on the top. Drizzle over the juices. Crumble a shortbread cookie over each plate.
