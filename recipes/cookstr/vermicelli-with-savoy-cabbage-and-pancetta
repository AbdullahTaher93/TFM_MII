In a covered pasta pot over high heat, bring water to a rapid boil. Meanwhile, in a large saut√© pan, heat olive oil, pancetta and onion over high heat. Cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add wine and cook, stirring, until reduced by half. Stir in cabbage. Reduce heat to the lowest possible setting and simmer until pasta is cooked. While the sauce is simmering, add salt and vermicelli to the boiling water and cook, uncovered, until pasta is al dente. Scoop out about 1 cup (250 mL) of the pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta. Add 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the reserved pasta water to cabbage mixture and raise heat to high. Add vermicelli and, using pasta tongs, toss to coat evenly, adding more pasta water if necessary. Add half the Parmigiano- Reggiano and toss well. Transfer to a large serving platter and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
