1 Preheat the oven to 325°F (you can also cook this brisket on top of the stove if you like). If you choose to brown the brisket first, heat a large casserole or Dutch oven that can later be covered over medium-high heat for 2 or 3 minutes. Add the oil, swirl it around, then add the beef. Sear it for about 5 minutes on each side, or until it is nicely browned. Season it with salt and pepper and remove to a platter. 2 Wipe out the pan with paper towels and return it to the stove; turn the heat to medium and add the butter. When it foams, add the onions and cook, stirring, until they are golden and soft, at least 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper, then stir in the tomato paste and the garlic. Return the meat to the pan, add the stock or water, and cover. 3 Cook over low heat or in the oven, turning the meat about every 30 minutes, until tender, 2½ to 3 hours. If the sauce seems too thin, allow the meat to rest on a platter for a few minutes while you boil the liquid down over high heat, scraping the bottom of a pan with a wooden spoon, until it thickens somewhat. Taste the sauce and add salt and/or pepper if needed. Slice the meat, return it to the sauce, and serve. .
