Season the meat on both sides with salt and pepper. Break the eggs into a pie plate or other deep plate that the scaloppini can fit into. Beat with a fork to mix well. Spread the flour on a sheet of wax paper. Spread the breadcrumbs on another sheet of wax paper. Draw each slice of veal through the egg, coating well, then dredge in the flour. Repeat the egg bath, then dredge in the breadcrumbs, pressing the crumbs into the veal to coat thoroughly. Set each breaded veal slice on a plate or platter, placing wax paper between them. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or for several hours. In a 12-inch skillet, over medium-high heat, heat about Â¼-inch of oil. When the oil is hot enough for a pinch of breadcrumbs to sizzle instantly, add two or three slices of the breaded veal. Do not crowd the pan. Cook for about 90 seconds on each side, until browned on both sides. Set aside on a wire rack to drain. When almost ready to serve, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Arrange the fried veal slices on a baking sheet. Top each with a light dusting of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Spoon some tomato sauce over each to almost entirely coat them. Place a few small slices of the mozzarella on top of the sauce. Bake until the mozzarella is melted and the sauce is bubbly, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
