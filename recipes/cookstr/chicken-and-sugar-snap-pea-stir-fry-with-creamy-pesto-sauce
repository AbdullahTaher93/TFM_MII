Prep: Trim and remove strings from peas. Cut chicken into strips about 2 inches long and ½ inch wide. Heat very large skillet over medium-high heat until skillet is hot. Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat bottom of skillet. Add sugar snap peas and stir-fry until peas are crisp-tender, about 1½ minutes. Transfer to plate. Add remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and heat. Season chicken with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper. Add to skillet and cook, stirring often, until chicken is lightly browned and almost cooked through, about 4 minutes. Return peas to skillet. Sprinkle cornstarch over broth in small bowl and whisk to dissolve cornstarch. Pour into skillet. Stir in pesto and heavy cream. Cook until sauce comes to a boil and thickens, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, spooned over rice. Variation Substitute ¼ cup chopped fresh basil for the pesto.
