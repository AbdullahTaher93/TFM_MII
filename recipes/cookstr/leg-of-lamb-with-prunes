Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Put the meat inside the cooker, and rub it on all sides with the seasoning. Add the garlic and prunes. Pour in the wine, and toss in a cinnamon stick. Cover and cook on low, for 8 hours, or on high for about 4 hours. I’d go with the longer cooking time and lower heat, though. When the lamb is done, if you’d like, remove the meat from the stoneware, and make a gravy out of the accumulated juices by whisking in some cornstarch. The prunes will be awfully squishy, and can blend right in. Serve with mashed potatoes or polenta with the gravy drizzled over the top.
