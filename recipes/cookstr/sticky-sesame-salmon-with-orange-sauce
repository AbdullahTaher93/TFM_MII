Preheat the oven to 350?F. Make the sauce: In a large bowl, stir together the ketchup, orange juice, sugar, chili paste and sesame oil. Set aside. Make the fish: Season the salmon generously with salt and pepper, then drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Place the seeds on a plate and dredge the tops of the fillets in the sesame seeds to coat. In an ovenproof skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the salmon, sesame seed side down, to the pan and sear, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the salmon until cooked through, about 6 minutes. Generously brush with the orange sauce and serve.
