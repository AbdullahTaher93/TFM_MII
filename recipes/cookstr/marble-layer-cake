Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, stir together 1.2 cups (250 mL) of the water and vanilla. Set both aside. In a mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg whites, one at a time, beating for 1 minute between each addition. Using a wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture alternating with water mixture, making three additions of flour and two of water, just until blended. Transfer about 1½ cups (375 mL) of batter to another small bowl. Blend in remaining water and cocoa powder. Divide white batter evenly between prepared pans. Using a spoon, drop six large puddles of chocolate batter over top of each pan of white batter. Using a small knife, drag through puddles in a spiral motion to create a marbling effect. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 22 to 28 minutes. Let cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes before transferring to rack to cool completely. For best results for decorating, wrap cake layers in plastic wrap and freeze for 1 to 2 days. Decorate with Old-Fashioned Chocolate Fudge Frosting or any of the icings(see Notes).
