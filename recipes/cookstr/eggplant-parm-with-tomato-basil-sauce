For the Sauce: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook 5 minutes. Add the garlic, dried basil, and parsley. Cook for 2 minutes then add the raisins, tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the fresh basil to the sauce a few minutes before serving time. Taste and adjust the seasonings. For the Eggplant: In a blender or food processor, process the pine nuts to a powder. Add the crumbs, yeast, red pepper flakes, parsley, garlic, and salt. Process until combined. Transfer the mixture to a shallow bowl or pie plate. In a second shallow pan, combine the soy milk and flour and mix well. Dip the eggplant in the soy milk mixture, then into the crumb mixture. Pat the crumbs onto the eggplant to coat completely. Place the eggplant slices on a baking sheet. Repeat until all the eggplant slices are coated. If desired, the prepared eggplant can be refrigerated for 30 minutes to help set the crumbs. Preheat the oven to 250Â°F. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add the slices and cook 3 to 5 minutes, turning once, until golden brown. Return to the baking sheet as they are cooked, and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve. Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain well and return to the pot. To serve, add 2 cups of the sauce to the spaghetti and toss to coat. Arrange a serving of spaghetti on four plates. Top each serving with the eggplant slices, and top with the sauce. Serve hot.
