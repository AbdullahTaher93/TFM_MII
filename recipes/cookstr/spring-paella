Prepare the sofrito. In a 16-to 18-inch paella pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the bell pepper, green beans, artichokes, tender garlic, and scallions and cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to brown and soften, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic cloves, tomatoes, and 2 pinches of salt and cook, stirring from time to time, over medium-low heat until the tomato has darkened to a deeper shade of red and the sofrito is pasty, 10 to 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the stock, bring to a simmer, and continue simmering until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. When the liquid has evaporated in the sofrito, sprinkle in the piment√≥n and saffron, letting the flavors meld for a few seconds while stirring constantly. Add the remaining 7 cups of stock, increase the heat, and bring to a boil. Check for salt and adjust the seasoning as needed. Sprinkle in the rice. With a wooden spoon, probe the pan to make sure the rice is evenly distributed. Do not stir again. Cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes over high heat. Distribute the snails, asparagus, and peas evenly around the pan. Cook for another 5 minutes over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cook for an additional 8 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al punto, with just a bite to it. Remove the paella from the heat, cover with paper towels, and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
