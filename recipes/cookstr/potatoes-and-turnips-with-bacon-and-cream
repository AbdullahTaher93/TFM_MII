Peel the potatoes and turnips and cut into ¼-inch dice. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Using kitchen scissors, snip off ¼-inch pieces of bacon into the skillet. Cook until nearly crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain off the fat. Add the potatoes and turnips to the bacon and sauté for about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth, bring to a boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes until vegetables are almost tender. Remove the lid. Add the cream and cook over high heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the liquid is almost evaporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
