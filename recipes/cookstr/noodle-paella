Heat the oil in a wide, shallow skillet or paella pan over medium low heat. Add the garlic and cook, shaking the pan, just until fragrant. Break the noodles into 4-inch lengths. Stir them into the oil and stir constantly until the noodles are lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir the shrimp and scallops into the pan and cook until the shrimp turn pink, about 2 minutes. Add the mussels. Pour in enough hot clam juice to barely cover the noodles. Adjust the heat so the liquid is at a happy bubble. Continue cooking, making sure there is enough liquid to cover the pasta. Add a little at a time if necessary. Keep tamping the noodles down under the broth to keep them submerged. When the pasta is tender and the seafood is cooked, about 5 minutes, lower the flame and continue cooking until all the liquid has evaporated and the noodles start to crisp up. Discard any mussels that haven’t opened. Taste and add salt and pepper if you like. Spoon onto a serving platter, scatter the parsley over the top, and serve hot. 3.
