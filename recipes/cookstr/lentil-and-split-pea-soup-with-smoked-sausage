In a large soup pot over high heat, combine all ingredients except sausage, salt, pepper, and vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add sausage and cook, uncovered, until peas and lentils are tender, 30 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper and stir in vinegar. Discard bay leaf. For a thicker soup, whisk soup with a large whisk to mash some of the peas and lentils. Serve in bowls.
