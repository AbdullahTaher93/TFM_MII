Prepare the compote: Run a paring knife down the center of the vanilla bean. Split it open with your fingers and use the knife to scrape the tiny black seeds into a medium-sized saucepan. Add the Madeira, sugar, vanilla bean, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the hard tips off the figs and divide each fig into 4 even wedges. Add the fruit to the Madeira, as well as the vanilla extract if you aren’t using a vanilla bean. Simmer the figs over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and transfer the compote to a bowl. Place the bowl in an ice bath to cool. Place in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve. Remove the vanilla bean before serving. Serving Suggestions: Serve this compote with a scoop of vanilla or chocolate ice cream. I also recommend the Dark Chocolate Sorbet and Vanilla Panna Cotta. The warm flourless Chocolate Bête Noire Cake is wonderful also.
