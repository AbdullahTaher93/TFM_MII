Preheat the oven to 400°F. Put the potatoes in a pan, cover with cold water, and add a good pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, simmer for 8 minutes, then drain well and return to the empty pan to steam for a few minutes. Put the oil or fat in a large roasting pan and place in the oven until smoking hot. Meanwhile, generously season the potatoes in their pan, then rough them up: either hold the lid on and give the pan a little shake or use a sharp fork to scratch their surfaces. When the oil is smoking hot, add the potatoes. Baste them well with the oil, then return the pan to the oven for 45 minutes, giving them a stir after about 30 minutes. By this stage, the potatoes should be almost done - i.e., have a golden crust all over but look as if they could still take a bit more crisping up. Create a space in the middle of the pan for the fish. Add the fish to the pan, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, then tuck in the bay leaves. Return to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the fish is just cooked. Serve at once, with pea purée or mushy squash and, by all means, ketchup—or roasted tomato sauce.
