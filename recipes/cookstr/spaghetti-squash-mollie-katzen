Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil, and spray lightly with nonstick spray. Cut the squash in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds. (The easiest way to remove the seeds is to cut loose the strand around them with scissors, and then scrape them away with a spoon.) Bake the halves facedown on a lightly oiled baking sheet for about 30 minutes, or until the skin can be pierced fairly easily with a fork. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and turn the squash over, leaving it on the baking sheet until it cools enough so that it is comfortable to handle. Then scoop out the insides, discarding the skin, and combing through the flesh with a fork to separate the strands. Set the squash aside. Place a large skillet or sauté pan over medium heat and wait for about 1 minute. Add the olive oil, and swirl to coat the pan. If desired, add the butter to the olive oil. Add the onion and sage to the hot pan, and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 8 minutes-or until the onion is becoming golden. Stir in the garlic, if using, and then add the squash and salt. Use a fork or tongs to mix the squash into the onion. When the squash is warmed through and everything is well combined, it’s time to serve. This dish tastes best hot or warm.
