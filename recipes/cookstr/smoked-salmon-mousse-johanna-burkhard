Drain salmon and place juice in small measuring cup. Add enough water to make Â¼ cup (50 mL). Sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand 1 to 2 minutes to soften. Microwave at Medium (50%) for 45 to 60 seconds or until dissolved. Remove any skin from salmon and discard. Place in a food processor with gelatin mixture, lemon zest and juice, and salt. Process until smooth. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Stir in sour cream, smoked salmon, green onions and dill. Season with hot pepper sauce to taste. Spoon mixture into a serving dish. Cover loosely with plastic wrap (it should not touch surface of the mousse), refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Garnish top with dill sprigs and lemon zest; serve with Melba toast or pumpernickel rounds.
