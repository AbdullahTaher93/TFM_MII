Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook the ground meat, chopping it with a spatula to brown it evenly. Add the onions, salt, and bell pepper and continue cooking until the onions and pepper are soft. Pulse the potato, tomato, and spices in a food processor or mash in a bowl until smooth. Add the tomato and potato mixture to the meat and cook for a minute to combine. Add the flour and stir until thickened. Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat to 350°F. Put a heaping tablespoon of filling in the middle of a tortilla, press it together gently, and lower it into the hot oil, being careful not to splash yourself. If it doesn’t bubble right away, the oil isn’t hot enough. When the taco is well browned, flip it over and cook the other side. When it is nicely browned on both sides, remove the taco from the oil with tongs, rotating it over the skillet drain both sides. Then place it on a paper towel and blot it gently to absorb the excess oil. Open the hot taco gently and stuff with tomato chopped lettuce, and salsa to taste. Press lightly to reseal and serve immediately.
