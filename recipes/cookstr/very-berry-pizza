Combine the ricotta, vanilla, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, the ginger, and lemon zest in a medium bowl. Reserve for topping. Sprinkle the work surface with the flour. Mix the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar with the cinnamon and knead it into the dough. Set aside until ready to make pizza. Preheat the grill, roll out and shape the dough, and grill the first side of the crust per the Master Instructions for gas or for charcoal (see Notes). Use tongs to turn the crust over. Continue grilling until the bottom crust is well browned. (Since you’re not melting cheese or warming toppings, you don’t need to switch to indirect heat.) Remove from the grill and immediately spread it evenly with the ricotta mixture. Let your inner artist dictate how you arrange the berries over the top. Finish with a generous drizzle of honey. Slice and serve immediately. Sweet Pizza Doughs: When making dessert pizzas, we thought it would be fun to experiment with sweet-flavored pizza dough. When we tried to knead cinnamon sugar and chocolate chips into the dough, the taste was great but it didn’t give it the texture we were looking for. To solve this problem, add a touch of sugar and the flavorings to the flour before adding any of the wet ingredients. Chocolate Dough: Add 2 tablespoons sugar and ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder to the flour. Stir and follow the recipe as written. Cinnamon Dough: Add 2 tablespoons sugar and 4 teaspoons ground cinnamon to the flour. Stir and follow the recipe as written.
