In a large soup pot, cook the bacon until crispy and brown, pouring off excess fat (youâ€™ll need 1/4 cup, or 60 ml). Add the onion and cook in the bacon mixture until softened but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add the pepper, celery, okra, and garlic. Stir well to combine. Add the flour and cook the mixture about 5 minutes, stirring, to remove the raw flour taste. Add the stock and Pickapeppa or Worcestershire. Add the coconut milk, thyme, and bay leaves and simmer 15 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the crabmeat. Add the spinach leaves and heat through until spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and add hot pepper sauce, if using. Serve piping hot.
