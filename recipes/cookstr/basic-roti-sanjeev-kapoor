Combine the atta and salt in a bowl. Add Â½ cup (100 ml) water and knead to make a medium-soft dough. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 portions and shape into balls. Dust with a little flour and roll out into 5-inch rounds. Place a nonstick griddle over medium heat and let it heat for 2 minutes. Place a dough round on it and cook for 30 seconds. Turn over and cook on the other side for 15 seconds, then, if you are using a gas burner, hold it with tongs over the open flame and cook until it puffs. Turn and cook the other side. Repeat with the remaining dough rounds. Serve hot, topped with ghee. Makes 1 2/3 cups (325 grams) Place a nonstick saucepan over medium heat and add the butter. When the butter is melted, lower the heat to low and cook, stirring frequently so that it does not scorch, for 30 minutes or until the liquid is light brown and the residue settles to the bottom. There will be some milk solids that rise to the top as foam and these should be skimmed off. Set aside to cool slightly. Strain into a clean jar and let cool completely. Cover with an airtight lid and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
