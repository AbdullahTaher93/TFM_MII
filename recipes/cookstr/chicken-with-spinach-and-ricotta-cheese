Preheat the oven to 350°F. Remove only the outer papery skin of the garlic cloves. Wrap in aluminum foil and put on the top rack of the oven. Roast for 50 to 60 minutes or until the cloves are soft. Remove from the oven and set aside, still wrapped loosely in foil to keep warm. Turn off the oven and preheat the broiler. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Wash the spinach several times in cool water. The spinach does not have to be dry. Drop the spinach in the boiling water, reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook the spinach for 2 to 3 minutes or until wilted. Alternatively, steam the spinach over boiling water or in an electric steamer. Drain the spinach well. Transfer the spinach to a large skillet and add the cheese, 2 teaspoons of the thyme, and nutmeg. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 4 to 5 minutes or until mixed and hot. Season with ½ teaspoon of pepper. Meanwhile, put the chicken breasts on a work surface and cover with plastic wrap or waxed paper. Using a meat mallet or the bottom of a small, heavy frying pan, pound the breasts so that they are about ½ inch thick. Sprinkle the chicken on both sides with the remaining thyme and pepper. Lay the chicken breasts in a broiling pan and broil for 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Meanwhile, in a medium-size nonstick skillet set over medium heat, cook the tomatoes and scallions, stirring gently, for 2 to 3 minutes or just until heated through and the tomatoes begin to soften. Arrange the chicken on a platter. Squeeze the softened garlic pulp from each of the cloves over each of the chicken breasts. Spread it thinly over the meat. Top with a heaping scoop of the hot spinach and ricotta mixture. Spoon the tomatoes and scallions over the spinach, season each serving with a squeeze of lemon juice and sea salt, if desired, and serve.
