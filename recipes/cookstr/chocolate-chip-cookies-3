Preheat the oven to 375°F and lightly grease 2 baking sheets. In the bowl of an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat the butter until creamy and light, about 2 minutes. Add both sugars and beat well. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat until fluffy. Sift together the flour and salt. In a small cup, stir the baking soda into the water; set aside. Add half the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat well. Beat in the baking soda mixture and then the remaining flour mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand. Drop the dough, using about 1 tablespoon per cookie, onto the baking sheets, spacing the cookies 1½ inches apart. Flatten the cookies so that they measure about 1½ inches in diameter. Bake for 10 minutes or until lightly browned and crisp. Remove the cookies from the baking sheets with a spatula and cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 2 months.
