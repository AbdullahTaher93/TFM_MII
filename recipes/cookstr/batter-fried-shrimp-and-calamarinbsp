In a medium bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the water. Let stand 1 minute or until creamy. Stir to dissolve. Add the eggs to the yeast mixture and beat well. Stir in the flour and salt. Beat with a whisk until smooth. Rinse the shrimp and calamari well. Pat dry. Cut the calamari crosswise into ½-inch rings. If large, cut the base of each group of tentacles in half. In a deep heavy saucepan, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches, or if using an electric deep-fryer, follow the manufacturer’s directions. Heat the oil to 370°F on a frying thermometer or until a drop of the batter placed in the oil sizzles and browns in 1 minute. Stir the shrimp and calamari into the batter. Remove the pieces a few at a time, letting the excess batter drip back into the bowl. Very carefully place the pieces in the hot oil. Do not crowd the pan. Fry, stirring once with a slotted spoon, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the seafood from the pan and drain on paper towels. Fry the remainder in the same way. Serve hot with lemon wedges.
