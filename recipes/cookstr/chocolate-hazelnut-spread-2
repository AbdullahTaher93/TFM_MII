Preheat the oven to 400°F. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them until the skins darken but don’t burn. Let them cool for about 5 minutes and then rub them with a dish towel to remove the skins. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, blend the hazelnuts until they are a smooth paste. This will take some patience. Scrape down the sides of the bowl several times during the process to keep the nuts blending; eventually they will start giving off oils and become smooth. This will take 5 to 10 minutes. While the nuts are blending, bring a pot of water to a simmer. Place the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl over the simmering water and stir to melt. Add the cocoa powder and mix until there are no lumps. Pour the chocolate mixture into the bowl of the food processor with the hazelnut paste and blend. Add the salt and ¼ cup of the powdered sugar and blend. Taste the mixture and add additional powdered sugar to taste. The spread will thicken as it cools. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. The spread can be reheated in the microwave to soften when needed.
