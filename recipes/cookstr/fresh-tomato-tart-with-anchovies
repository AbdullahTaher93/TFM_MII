1 To make the crust, in a bowl, combine the flour and salt and mix well. Cut the butter into ½-inch chunks and add them to the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the flour until pea-sized balls form. Add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. As you add the water, turn the mixture lightly with a fork and then with your fingertips to keep the pastry light and flaky. It will cling together in a rough mass. Gather the dough into a ball-it will be a little crumbly-wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 425°F. 2 On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a round ¼ inch thick. Carefully transfer to a straight-sided 9-inch tart pan with l-inch sides. Line the pastry with aluminum foil or parchment paper and add pastry weights or dried beans. 3 Bake until set, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the weights and foil or parchment. Prick any bubbles with the tines of a fork and return to the oven until firm and bisque-colored, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, place on a baking sheet, and let cool before filling. Reduce the oven to 375°F. 4 To make the filling, in a bowl, combine the eggs, cream, half-and-half, and pepper and mix well. Pour the egg mixture into the partially baked pastry crust. Top with the sliced tomatoes, then arrange the anchovies, pinwheel fashion, on top. Sprinkle evenly with the thyme and the Parmesan and Gruyère cheeses. 5 Carefully transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake the tart until the top is puffed and lightly golden and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let stand for at least 15 minutes before cutting. Serve hot or at room temperature.
