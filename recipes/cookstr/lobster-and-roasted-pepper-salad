Roast the , then peel and seed them as directed. Cut them into strips about 1 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long and set aside. While the peppers are roasting, pour water to a depth of 1-inch in the bottom of a steamer pan with a tight-fitting lid and bring to a boil. Place the live lobsters in the steamer insert and cover the steamer. Close any vent holes on the lid. Cook over medium heat until the lobsters turn bright red, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the lobsters from the pot and, when they are cool enough to handle, remove the tail and claw meat from the shells. Remove the intestinal vein that runs down the center of each tail. Cut the lobster meat into bite-sized pieces. In an attractive serving bowl, combine the lobster meat with the pepper strips. Drizzle with olive oil to taste and then the lemon juice. Sprinkle with the basil. Serve warm or at room temperature.
