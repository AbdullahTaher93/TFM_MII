Preheat the oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone, place it in the oven. Sprinkle a 14-inch pizza pan with cornmeal. Or if you are using a pizza stone, sprinkle cornmeal on a wooden peel (paddle) or a rimless baking sheet. Set aside. Slice all of the mushrooms ¼ inch thick. If some of the mushrooms are quite large, cut them in half crosswise after slicing. In a medium-size ovenproof pan, combine 1 tablespoon of the oil and the mushrooms. Add salt and pepper to taste. Shake the pan vigorously to coat the mushrooms and place in the oven. Roast for 10 minutes, or until the mushrooms have softened and are beginning to develop a caramel color around the edges. Remove from the oven. Taste and add more salt if necessary, but remember that the cheese and the arugula will also have salt. In a small bowl mix together the arugula, lemon juice, and remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Prepare the pizza dough. Brush the rim of the dough with olive oil. Distribute the cheese and then the mushrooms over the dough, leaving about a 2-inch rim. Slide the pizza onto the stone, if using. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges of the crust are a deep golden brown and the cheese is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. To serve, slice into wedges and top each serving with a handful of the arugula salad.
