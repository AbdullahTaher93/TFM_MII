Cook the onions slowly in the oil in a large pan until softened. Beat the eggs thoroughly into the fromage blanc and the cream. Season it with salt, pepper, and nutmeg and add the onions. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Roll the pastry out until 1/8 inch thick and place in a round 9-inch flan ring or tart pan; pinch up the edge to form a raised border, which will contain the filling. Pour in the cheese and onion mixture and bake for 35 minutes. Eat while hot.
