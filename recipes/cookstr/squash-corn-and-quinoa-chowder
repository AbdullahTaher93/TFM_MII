Cut the kernels from the cobs and set aside. Bring the cobs, kombu, and water to boil in a large pot. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. While the stock is simmering, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and salt, and saute for 10 minutes, or until the onions are translucent. Remove the corncobs from the pot and discard. Remove the kombu, cut into Â¼-inch squares, and return to the pot along with the sauteed onions. Rinse the quinoa and add to the pot. Stirring occasionally, cover and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the quinoa is soft. Add the squash and continue simmering for 10 minutes or until tender. Add the corn kernels and simmer 2 to 3 minutes more. Place the miso in a small bowl, add a ladle of the soup, and stir to dilute. Stir the diluted miso, parsley, and pepper into the pot. Remove the pot from the heat, cover, and let stand 1 minute before serving.
