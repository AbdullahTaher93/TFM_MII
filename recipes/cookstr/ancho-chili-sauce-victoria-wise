Remove the stems and seeds from the chilies. Quarter the garlic cloves. Place the chilies, garlic, chili powder, and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook until the chilies are soft, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat; set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Pur√©e the mixture in a food processor, blender, or food mill. Add the salt and mix well. Serve right away, or cover, refrigerate, and use within 3 months.
