1 Traditionally, this spread is made with a mortar and pestle, pounding the ingredients until they form a smooth paste. The process can also be accomplished in a blender, however. Put the olives, anchovies, capers, and thyme in a blender along with the olive oil and purée until smooth. 2 If you are not using it immediately, put the purée in a jar, cover tightly, and store in the refrigerator, where it will keep for up to 3 months.
