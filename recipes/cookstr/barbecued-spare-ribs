Rub the chutney through a sieve into a large bowl. Add the tomatoes, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, chile sauce, soy sauce, paprika, and garlic and mix well. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Season the ribs with salt and pepper. Combine the ribs and chutney mixture into a large roasting pan, overlapping the ribs. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour. Baste the ribs and continue baking, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, until tender. Let cool for 5 minutes. Cut into individual ribs, then pile onto a serving platter.
