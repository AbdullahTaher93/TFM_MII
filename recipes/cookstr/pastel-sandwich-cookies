Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add milk and vanilla; beat 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low; add flour mixture in batches, beating after each addition just until mixed. Divide dough in half; wrap each half in wax paper. Refrigerate 4 hours. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Roll half of the chilled dough on a floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. (Keep remaining dough refrigerated.) Cut into circles with a 1Â½-inch-round floured biscuit or cookie cutter. Transfer rounds to a lightly greased cookie sheet; pierce with the tines of a fork 4 times. Bake until dough is baked through and firm, about 10 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough. For filling, beat sugar, butter, vanilla and salt in a medium bowl with a mixer on low speed; divide mixture among 3 small bowls. Stir in 2 teaspoons of one flavor of liqueur into each bowl; stir in food coloring if desired. Spread 1 heaping teaspoon of filling on bottom of 1 cookie; top with another cookie to make a sandwich. Repeat with remaining cookies. Store in tightly covered container.
