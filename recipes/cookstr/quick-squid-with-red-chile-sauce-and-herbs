In a large bowl, combine the squid with the fish sauce, lime juice, green onions, salt, and pepper. Set aside while you heat a wok or large saut√© pan over high heat. Decoratively assemble the lettuce, cilantro, Thai basil, carrots, and a bowl of chile sauce on a large platter. Add the vegetable oil to the wok over high heat and, when it is hot, add the squid. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes only, just until the squid ring edges curl up a bit and turn white. Transfer the squid to a bowl, leaving the liquid in the wok. Reduce the liquid down to a thick glaze (making sure to add any juices that accumulate at the bottom of the bowl the squid is resting in), about 5 minutes. Pour the glaze back over the squid and serve it on the platter with the accompaniments.
