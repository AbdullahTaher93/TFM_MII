Prepare the mashed potato layer: Heat the oil in a very large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until very soft and golden, 30 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large pot, add water to cover, lightly salt it, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and gently boil the potatoes until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes and put them through a ricer (preferred) or hand-mash them. Strain the onions, reserving the oil. Puree the strained onions in a blender, and combine the puree with the mashed potatoes. Add about 2 teaspoons salt and the pepper, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Prepare the meat layer: Place the bread in a shallow bowl, add water to cover, and soak for 1 or 2 minutes. Then drain the bread, and using your hands, squeeze out the excess water. Crumble the bread into bits in a large bowl. Add the onion, ground beef, eggs, garlic, salt, and pepper, and mix together. Spread about one third of the mashed potato mixture over the bottom of a 13 × 9-inch baking pan. Pat the meat mixture evenly over the potatoes; then cover it with the remaining mashed potatoes. Jab all over with a fork. (Don’t ask why.) Brush lightly with the reserved oil, and bake until the meat is cooked through and the potatoes are golden brown, about 1¼ hours. Cut into squares and serve hot. Variation: This dish can be made using your own favorite meat loaf and/or mashed potato recipe.
