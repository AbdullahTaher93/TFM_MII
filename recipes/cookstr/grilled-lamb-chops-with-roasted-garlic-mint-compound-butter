Coat the surface of the lamb chops with the marinade. Marinate at room temperature 30 minutes. Sprinkle the chops with the salt and pepper. Make the butter: In a small sauté pan, heat the oil over low heat. Cook the shallots, garlic, and salt 3–4 minutes. Add the wine, pepper, and mint jelly and cook 5 minutes more, stirring often to prevent sticking and burning. Add the mint and cook for 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and cool completely. Place the softened butter in a mixing bowl. Using a rubber spatula, blend together all of the ingredients. Line a large platter or small baking sheet with waxed paper. Place the butter in a pastry bag with a medium star tip attached. Pipe rosettes—2–3 teaspoons each—onto the waxed paper. You should have 16 rosettes when finished. Refrigerate until needed. Prepare the grill. Cook over direct medium heat until desired doneness is reached, 12–14 minutes for medium rare. Remove from the grill and place on serving dishes. Top each chop with a rosette of Roasted Garlic-Mint Compound Butter and serve immediately.
