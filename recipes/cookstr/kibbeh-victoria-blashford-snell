To make the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook about 6 minutes, until golden. Add the ground sirloin and cook, breaking up the meat, about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Stir in the pine nuts and cinnamon and season with salt and pepper. Let cool. Purèe the onion in a food processor. Add the bulgur, raw beef, and allspice and season with salt and pepper. Process until the mixture can be kneaded like a dough. Moisten your hands with water. Flatten an egg-sized piece of the shell mixture to about ¼ in (5mm) thickness. Top with a portion of the filling and enclose the filling with the shell mixture. Shape the ends into points. Continue with the remaining shell mixture and filling to make a total of 12 kibbeh. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Halfway fill a large frying pan with oil and heat over high heat to 350°F (170°C). In batches, add the kibbeh and deep-fry about 3 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
