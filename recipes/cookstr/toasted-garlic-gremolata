Heat a small saut√© pan over very low heat and add the oil and the garlic. Cook gently until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Immediately remove the garlic from the pan to prevent it from burning. Set aside in a small bowl and cool. Add the lemon zest, parsley, and salt to the toasted garlic and mix well. Place about 1/2 teaspoon on each piece of veal shank.
