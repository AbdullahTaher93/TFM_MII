In a saucepan or in the microwave, melt 1/4 cup of the butter. Crush the cookies and mix them with the melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 13-by-9-by-3-inch baking dish or round 5-quart dish. Cover the crushed cookies with softened ice cream. Cover and freeze for at least half an hour. In the top of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, slowly melt the remaining 1/4 cup butter, sugar, and chocolate. Gradually add the milk and cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens. Stir in the vanilla, then remove from the heat. Allow the sauce to cool. Pour the cooled sauce over the ice cream layer and return the cake to the freezer until set, about an hour. Spread the Cool Whip or whipped cream over the chocolate sauce, and sprinkle with the pecans. Freeze for at least half an hour, until set. Remove the ice cream cake from the freezer at least 10 minutes before serving.
