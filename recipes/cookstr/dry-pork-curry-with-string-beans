1 Combine all curry paste ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth, adding more water as needed. Set aside. 2 Heat the oil in a large wok over medium heat. Add the pork and stir- fry until it turns white, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside. Stir in the curry paste and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Return the pork to the wok and stir well to coat the meat with curry paste. Add the Â½ cup (125 ml) water, string beans, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, dried shrimp (if using), and palm sugar. Stir until well combined. If the curry seems too dry, add water a little at a time, but be careful not to use too much. Remove from the heat and serve.
