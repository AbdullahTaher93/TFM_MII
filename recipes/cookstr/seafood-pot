Soak the clams in a bowl of cold water, leave them for about 5 minutes while you slice the fish, then discard the open or cracked clams and drain the rest. Cut the fish into Â½-inch slices, and also slice the squid into the same width rings. Melt the butter and oil in a large pot or pan with a lid, then over high heat toss in the fish and squid and stir them around until they begin to go opaque. Add the clams and white wine, and clamp on the lid, shaking the pot over the heat, and let it cook for about 3 minutes. Lift the lid, avoiding the steam, and pour in the sherry. Cover again and leave for another 3 minutes or so, shaking about again every now and then. Serve the seafood in the pot, sprinkling over the chopped chives, if preferred.
