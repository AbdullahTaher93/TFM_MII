Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the pasta sauce, wine, garlic, and basil in a 2-quart saucepan. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Let simmer while you prepare the eggplant. Heat ½ cup of the oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Crack the eggs into a wide, shallow bowl, season them with salt and pepper to taste, and lightly beat them with a fork. Arrange a double thickness of paper towels on a counter near the skillet. Place 2 to 3 slices of eggplant in the beaten egg and turn them to coat. Using a fork, transfer the eggplant slices to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and puffy but not cooked through, about 1 minute per side, then drain them on the paper towels. Repeat with the remaining slices of eggplant, wiping out the pan and adding more oil as necessary. Place half of the eggplant slices in the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Pour half of the pasta sauce over the eggplant, spreading it out evenly with a spatula. Scatter 2 cups of the cheese over the sauce. Repeat with the remaining eggplant, pasta sauce, and cheese. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake the casserole until it is bubbling and the cheese has melted, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil and let the eggplant rest for 5 minutes, then slice and serve. 4. Place half of the eggplant slices in the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.
