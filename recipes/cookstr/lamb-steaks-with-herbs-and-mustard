Mix the herbs, garlic, and peppercorns together. Rub all over the lamb, pressing to help the herbs adhere. Place in a shallow dish. Drizzle with 2 tbsp of the oil and 1 tbsp of the lemon juice. Cover and let marinate for at least 2 hours. Position a broiler rack 6 in (15cm) from the broiler and preheat. Oil the broiler pan. Place the lamb on the pan. Broil, turning once, about 8 minutes, until well browned. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining 2 tbsp lemon juice with the lemon zest, mustard, and salt, then whisk in the remaining 6 tbsp oil. Serve the lamb topped with the lemon mixture.
