Season the lamb steaks with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large casserole over medium-high heat. In batches, brown the meat on both sides. Transfer to a plate. Meanwhile, pulse the onion, garlic, and chile in a food processor until it forms a coarse paste. Add to the casserole and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Stir in the wine, then the tomatoes and thyme. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Return the lamb to the casserole. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer until the lamb is very tender, about 45 minutes. During the last few minutes, stir in the olives. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot, sprinkled with thyme and parsley.
