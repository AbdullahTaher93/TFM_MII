Preheat oven to 400°F with rack in top third. Lightly oil a 13 x 9-inch glass or metal baking dish. Season fillets with salt and pepper to taste. Fold each fillet in half crosswise so it forms a triangle of double thickness. Place in one layer in prepared dish. Mix bread crumbs, garlic, and oregano in small bowl. Mix in enough olive oil to make a paste, about 1½ tablespoons. Spread a thin layer of the crumb mixture over the top of each fillet. Drizzle with remaining olive oil. Bake until topping is lightly browned and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve right away with lemon wedges on the side. Variation for Crisp Crusted Flounder Add a tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley or basil to the bread crumbs, garlic, and oregano. Serving Suggestions for Crisp Crusted Flounder A raw shredded carrot salad dressed with a garlicky vinegar and oil dressing or sauteed asparagus.
