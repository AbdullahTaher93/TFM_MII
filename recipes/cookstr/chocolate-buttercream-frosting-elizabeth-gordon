In the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring occasionally, until it is smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside for 5 minutes. Place the frosting in the bowl of a stand mixer and pour in the cooled melted chocolate. Beat the chocolate and frosting together until the frosting is fluffy and the chocolate is evenly mixed in. This frosting is best used on the day it is made.
