Cook the chicken wings, onion, carrot, and celery in the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat, stirring often, just until the vegetables soften (the chicken should not brown), about 10 minutes Add enough cold water to the pot to cover the ingredients by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Add the parsley, thyme, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the broth is full-flavored, at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours. Strain the broth through a colander set over a large bowl. Discard the solids. Let stand for 5 minutes. Skim off the clear yellow fat that rises to the surface. Cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. (The broth can be prepared up to 3 days ahead, covered, and refrigerated, or frozen for up to 3 months.)
