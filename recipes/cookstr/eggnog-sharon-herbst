Beat egg, sugar, vanilla, and salt until smooth and light; pour into chilled glass. Stir in liquor and milk, mixing well; sprinkle lightly with nutmeg. Eggnog for One: Since this libation isn’t typically served over ice, chilling all the ingredients beforehand will create a colder drink. Alternatively, the ingredients may be shaken with ice and strained into the glass, but that slightly dilutes the mix. VARIATIONS Hot Eggnog: Heat milk just until it simmers (do not boil). Gradually whisk milk into beaten-egg mixture. Pour into a warm heatproof mug. See also Hot Drinks. Nogless Eggnog: Substitute 2 oz. (¼ cup) more milk for the liquor.
