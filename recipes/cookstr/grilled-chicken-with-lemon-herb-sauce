Stir together lemon juice, oregano, chives and salt and pepper. Pour into a serving dish large enough to hold all chicken pieces. Rinse and wipe chicken with paper towel. Grill at medium-high heat or roast until meat is no longer pink inside, about 20 minutes. When chicken is cooked, transfer to bowl with lemon mixture. Turn to coat and serve.
