To make the baked ricotta: Put the ricotta in a large sieve or colander lined with a double thickness of cheesecloth. Cover the ricotta with the cheesecloth, set the sieve or colander over a bowl to catch the draining whey, and set a plate with a weight (such as a heavy can of tomatoes) on top of the ricotta to speed draining. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Butter a 10-inch pie pan. In a large bowl, stir together the ricotta and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the eggs, beating well. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the upper third of the oven until puffed and lightly brown, about 55 minutes. Let cool, then unmold onto a cutting board. To make the parsley salad: In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients. Toss well. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Serve immediately or let stand for up to 1 hour, tossing occasionally. Cut the ricotta into 8 wedges and place on individual plates. Accompany each serving with some of the parsley salad.
