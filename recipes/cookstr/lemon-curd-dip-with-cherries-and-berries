In a bowl, whisk together the eggs. Whisk in the sugar, then the lemon juice. Pour this mixture into a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the saucepan over medium-low heat, and whisk the mixture constantly until it is very hot, about 5 minutes. Continue to whisk the mixture until it thickens (don’t worry if the sauce bubbles or boils a little), about 5 minutes more. Take the saucepan off the heat. Add the butter in three or four parts, whisking all the while. Pour the sauce into an attractive bowl, and chill it for at least 1½ hours. Place the strawberries and the cherries in another bowl or on a plate. Serve the curd as a dip with the fruit.
