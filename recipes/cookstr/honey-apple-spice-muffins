Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In work bowl fitted with metal blade, process apple until coarsely chopped, about 20 seconds. Transfer to a bowl. Set aside. In same work bowl fitted with metal blade, process sugar and shortening until smooth, about 30 seconds. With the motor running, add eggs, milk, honey and vanilla through the feed tube. Remove lid and add cake flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Cover and pulse just until incorporated, about 10 times. Add apple chunks and pulse until mixed, about 5 times. Divide batter evenly into prepared muffin tin. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool in tin on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Transfer to rack to cool completely. Variation: Add ½ cup (125 mL) chopped walnuts to the batter with apple.
