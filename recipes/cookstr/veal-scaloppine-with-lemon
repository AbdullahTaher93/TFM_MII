Season the veal with salt and pepper. Spread the flour on a sheet of wax paper, and dredge the slices in the flour. Shake off the excess flour. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil and 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add half of the veal slices to the pan, being careful to not crowd the pieces, and sauté for 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the pieces to a warm platter. Sauté the remaining veal, and remove to the platter. Add the chicken broth to the skillet and bring it to a simmer. Scrape up all the brown bits on the bottom of the pan, and cook until the broth is reduced to about 2 tablespoons, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and parsley, and stir. Stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Add the veal, turning it to heat and coat with the sauce. Adjust the seasonings, and serve immediately.
