Roast for 45 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest portion registers 180°F and the juices run clear. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, Cook the onion for 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the broth, cherries, capers, honey, cumin, and cinnamon stick.
