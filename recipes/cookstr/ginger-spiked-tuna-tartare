Cut the tuna into ¼-inch slices, then cut lengthwise into strips and across into ¼-inch dice. Place in a small bowl. Acid the ginger oil, wasabi, sesame seeds, cilantro, ¼ teaspoon of salt, and pepper. Stir to combine, then set aside for a few minutes to let the flavors develop. Taste and add a bit more salt if necessary.
