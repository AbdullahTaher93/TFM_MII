To make the sauce, process the arugula, mayonnaise, garlic, and lemon juice until the arugula is purèed. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon into a serving dish and chill until it is time to serve. Place the flour in a shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper. Beat the eggs in a second bowl. Spread the panko in a third bowl. Cut the fish fillets into 8 equal portions. Toss the fish and shrimp in flour, then dip in beaten egg, and coat in panko. Preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C). Pour enough oil into a large deep saucepan to come halfway up the sides. Heat over high heat to 350°F (180°C). In batches, fry the seafood for 2–3 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towel-lined baking sheets and keep warm in the oven until all of the fish is fried. Divide the fish among dinner plates and serve immediately, with the sauce served separately.
