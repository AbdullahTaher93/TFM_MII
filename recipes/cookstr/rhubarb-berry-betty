Combine the bread, brown sugar, butter, orange juice, orange zest, cinnamon and vanilla in a large nonreactive bowl; mix until smooth. Reserve half the bread mixture. Mix the remaining bread mixture with the rhubarb. Spoon into a 9Ã—13-inch baking dish sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Place on a rack in the upper third of the oven. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir in the berries; the dish will be quite full. Top with the reserved bread mixture. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes longer or until bubbly and brown. Cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Serve warm topped with ice cream or whipped cream.
