Cut the chilled tofu into bite-sized pieces, about 1½ inches on each side. Arrange the tofu cubes on a large serving platter. Top each square with a portion of the ginger, scallions, and sesame seeds. Each diner should transfer some of the tofu squares to an individual plate and pour about ¼ teaspoon tamari over each square.
