Warm the butter and oil in a large pan over mediumâ€“low heat. Add the onions and garlic to the pan, and cook until the onions are soft (not brown). Stir well a few times during this process. The cooking will take time, but the slow-cooking really brings out the sweetness of the onions. Add the balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, thyme, and stir well. Stir constantly until the balsamic has cooked into the onions and they have a deep brown color. Salt to taste.
