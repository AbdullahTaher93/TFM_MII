PREPARING THE GAZPACHO: Cut away the sides of the tomatoes and cut these into dice. Work the pulp and seeds through a strainer and reserve what comes through. Halve the cucumber lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop the seeds out of one half. Cut the half lengthwise into strips about 1/4-inch wide. Slice the strips crosswise to make 1/4-inch dice. Save the remaining cucumber half for another use. Combine all the vegetables, the tomato pulp, the cilantro, the oil, the vinegar, and the salt in a mixing bowl and stir thoroughly. Refrigerate for 2 hours. The salt will draw the liquid out of the vegetables and provide the liquid for the gazpacho. PREPARING THE BAVARIAN MOUSSE: In a medium saucepan, gently heat the shrimp broth until it is slightly warmer than room temperature and add the gelatin and its soaking liquid, stirring until the gelatin is completely dissolved. In a mixing bowl, combine the tarragon with the cream and whip to soft peaks with a whisk (the cream will droop off the end of the whisk when you hold it horizontally). Use a rubber spatula to fold the cream into the warm broth mixture, and season with salt to taste. Ladle 1/4 cup of the mixture into each of 6 well-chilled deep soup bowls and refrigerate for at least an hour until the mixture sets. The mousse can be prepared 1 day ahead. Spoon the gazpacho into each of the mousse-lined bowls and serve.
