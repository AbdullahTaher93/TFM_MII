Prepare ahead Complete through the end of step 2 several hours in advance, then finish cooking just before serving. Place the carrots, orange zest and juice, butter, sugar, and garlic in a small saucepan, and season with salt and pepper. Add enough cold water to barely cover the carrots. Bring to a boil, then cover and cook over a medium-high heat for 8â€“10 minutes, or until the carrots are just tender. Remove the cover and boil until all the liquid has evaporated and the carrots are glazed and golden at the edges, shaking the pan occasionally to prevent sticking. Just before serving, sprinkle in the thyme leaves.
