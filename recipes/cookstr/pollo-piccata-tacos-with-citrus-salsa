In a small bowl, beat egg with 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the lemon juice. Place flour in a shallow dish. Dip each chicken breast in egg mixture then dredge in flour. Discard any excess egg mixture and flour. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add chicken and lightly brown on both sides, about 6 minutes per side. Add chicken broth, remaining 2 tbsp (30 mL) of lemon juice and hot pepper flakes. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until chicken is tender and no longer pink inside, about 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and cut into thin slices. To build tacos, divide chicken equally among tortillas. Top with salad mix and Citrus Salsa. Fold tortillas in half. 3.
