Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. To make the filling, combine the cheese and eggs in a medium mixing bowl. Stir gently. Set aside. Cut all the filla sheets with a sharp knife crosswise into 3 rectangular sections about 3 inches wide. Work with only one strip of filla at a time. Cover the rest with wax paper and a damp towel. Brush the strip of filla with melted butter, then fold in half length wise. Spoon a heaping teaspoon of filling near one end of a filla strip, about 1 inch from the short edge. Fold one corner over the filling, making a triangle. Continue folding over the filla, making a triangle each time, until the whole strip is used. Tuck the loose end neatly into the triangular shape. Repeat with the remaining filla strips. Then brush the top of each triangle with butter and dip into the sesame seeds. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the triangles are crisp and lightly browned.
