Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a food processor or mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter and process or work with a fork until the mixture resembles crumbs. Add the egg yolk and pulse the motor on and off or stir with a fork until the mixture comes together to form a soft dough. Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 12-inch circle. Place the rolled dough in a 10-inch tart pan and line with foil or baking parchment, then fill with special pie weights or ordinary dry rice. (The weights or rice will prevent the crust from puffing up and losing its shape while it is baking.) Bake for 10 minutes, remove tart shell from the oven, then remove the foil and pie weights. Fill the partially baked shell with the rhubarb mixture and continue with the recipe. Or return the tart shell to the oven until browned and use for another type of fruit tart.
