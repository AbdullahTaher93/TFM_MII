Butter the steamed pudding mold, including the cove. In a large bowl, combine the flours, cornmeal, baking soda, and salt. Add the buttermilk and molasses and stir thoroughly. Fold in the raisins. Pour the mixture into the mold and cover lightly. Place the mold in a large pot and fill with hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the mold. Cover the pot and steam over moderate heat for 3 hours, replenishing the water as necessary every 30 to 40 minutes. When the bread is cooked, unmold and serve warm, slicing the loaf with a strong string.
