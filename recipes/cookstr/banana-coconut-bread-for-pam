Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter two 9-by-5-inch bread pans. Puree the bananas (with their juice if using defrosted ones) in a blender. Measure out 3 cups and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and nutmeg; set aside. Using a mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vinegar and rum and beat briefly. Add the banana puree and the flour mixture alternately, about 1 cup at a time, beginning with the bananas, beating until smooth after each addition. Stir in the coconut. Spoon the batter into the buttered pans. Sprinkle the top of each loaf with about 1 tablespoon demerara or brown sugar. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until golden. Let cool for 20 minutes, then turn out of the pans onto a wire rack to cool completely and firm up.
