Put the tomates verdes and chiles into a small pan, cover with water, and cook over low heat until soft but not falling apart. Drain off all but 1/3 cup (83 ml) of the cooking water. Transfer to a blender jar with the garlic and blend until smooth. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet, add the sauce with salt to taste, and cook over medium heat, stirring from time to time, until slightly reduced and seasoned-about 5 minutes. Keep warm. Heat oil to a depth of about ¼-inch (7 mm) in a deep skillet, add the tortilla pieces, a few at a time, and fry until crisp and light gold. Drain on paper toweling and continue with the remaining pieces. Drain off all but ¼ cup (63 ml) of the oil in the pan. Add the tortilla pieces and the onion, cover, and fry over low heat, shaking the pan from time to time, until the onion is translucent; it should not be browned. Add the warm sauce and cook, stirring to mix well for about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, topping each portion with a generous amount of cilantro, cheese, and cream.
