Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the olive oil in a dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot. Add the lamb shanks and brown thoroughly all over—you may have to do this in batches. Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine, then cover the pot and put it in the oven for 2 hours or until the meat is almost falling off the bone.
