Scoop the yolks out into a bowl. Reserve the egg-white halves. Add the onion, celery, capers, mayonnaise, mustard, salt, and Tabasco to the yolks and mix well with a whisk. (You can even beat it to fluffiness.) Load the mixture into a pastry bag and pipe it into the centers of the egg white halves. Cut the avocado halves into ¼-inch-thick slices. Fan out each sliced avocado half on one side of an individual plate, with the slices overlapping. Place an egg half in the avocado’s pit indentation. Put 2 tomato half-moons and another egg half on the other side of the plate. Surround all with lettuce leaves. Drizzle the rémoulade sauce generously over each salad and serve chilled.
