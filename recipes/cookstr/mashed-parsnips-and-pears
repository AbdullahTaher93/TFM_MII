Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the parsnips, cover, and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until tender when tested with a small, sharp knife. Drain thoroughly. Place the cooked parsnips in the container of a food processor. Add the pears to the hot parsnips and whirl until chunky. Add the cream, butter, and salt and pepper to taste, and puree until almost smooth. The mixture can be slightly chunky, or you may prefer it smoother. Taste for seasoning. Serve hot or make ahead of time and place in a small casserole or ovenproof skillet, cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook. To reheat, place in a 350 degree F oven for about 15 minutes, or until bubbling hot. Stir well before serving. Variation: Add 2 peeled, chopped apples to the puree instead of the pears.
