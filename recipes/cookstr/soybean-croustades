Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Trim the crusts from the bread. Flatten the slices with a rolling pin, and brush with the melted butter. Using a 2in (5cm) round cookie cutter, stamp out 3 pieces from each slice of bread. Push the bread, butter-side down, firmly into a 12-cup mini-muffin pan. Bake for about 12 minutes, or until well crisped. Remove the croustades from the pan and let cool on a wire rack. Cook the frozen beans in a saucepan of lightly salted boiling water about 5 minutes, until tender. Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain again. Coarsely purèe the beans, shallot, basil, oil, and garlic in a blender or food processor. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the bean pesto among the croustades and top each with a basil leaf. Serve immediately.
