Preheat the oven to 350°F. Oil a 9-inch ovenproof skillet or a heavyweight 9-by-11-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, baking powder, and salt to taste. In a medium bowl, stir together the 2/3 cup of oil, the eggs, sour cream, and creamed corn. Stir in the bell and jalapeno peppers. Toss the cheeses together in a small bowl, add ¾ cup of the cheeses, and stir. Scrape this mixture into the cornmeal mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just blended. Pour the batter into the skillet. Scatter the remaining ¼ cup of the cheese over the top. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until the edges of the cornbread begin to brown, the top is set, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the skillet on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Cut into wedges, and serve directly from the skillet.
