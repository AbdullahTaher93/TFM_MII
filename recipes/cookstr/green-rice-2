Have ready a heavy-bottomed pan about 4 inches (10 cm) deep and 9 inches (23 cm) across. Cover the rice with hot water and let soak for about 5 minutes. Drain in a strainer, then rinse well in cold water and leave to drain for a few minutes. Heat the oil in the pan. Give a final shake to the rice in the strainer and stir it into the oil. Fry over a very high heat, turning the rice thoroughly from time to time, until it is a pale golden color. Tip the pan to one side, holding back the rice with a wide metal spatula, and drain off about 3 tablespoons of the oil. Pour the Â½ cup (125 ml) of water into a blender jar. Add the greens, chiles, onion, and garlic and blend until smooth, adding more water only if absolutely necessary to release the blades of the blender. Add the blended ingredients to the rice and fry over high heat, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the rice is almost dry. Add the broth and salt to taste and took over medium heat until all the liquid has been absorbed and small air holes appear in the surface of the rice-about 15 minutes. Cover the pan with a lid or foil and cook for 5 minutes longer. Remove from the heat. Cover the rice with a piece of terry doth and set aside to continue cooking in its own steam for 20 to 30 minutes.
