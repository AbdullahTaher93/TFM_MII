Slice the tops off the tomatoes and with a spoon, scoop out the seeds, leaving a thick shell, turn the tomatoes upsidedown to drain for 5 minutes. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200°F to 220°F. Mix together the cheese, bread, and caraway. Stuff the mixture into each of the tomatoes and top each with a liberal dusting of paprika. Transfer the tomatoes to the smoker and cook for 20 to 30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the tomatoes are warmed through. Remove the tomatoes from the smoker and serve immediately. Serving Suggestion Serve these on the side with mixed sausages and spicy brown mustard.
