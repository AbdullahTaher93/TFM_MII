In a 10- to 12-inch sautÃ© pan, combine the olive oil and pancetta and cook over medium heat until the pancetta is soft and translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the onion, red pepper flakes, and artichokes and cook until the artichokes are just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the water, favas, peas, escarole, and pepper and cook until the escarole is wilted and soft and the peas and beans are tender, about 8 minutes. Season with salt. Tear the mint leaves into pieces, sprinkle over the scafata, and serve. This dish is also good at room temperature.
