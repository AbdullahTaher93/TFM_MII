In a nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil, then add the sausage and cook slowly over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink but not browned. With a slotted spoon transfer the sausage to a bowl, leaving the fat behind. Discard all but 1 teaspoon of the fat in the skillet. Add the garlic and fennel seeds and cook, stirring, until the garlic begins to turn golden brown. Stir in the fresh or canned tomatoes, dried tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, saffron, bay leaf, and basil leaves. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the sauce, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover the skillet and cook 5 minutes more. Return the sausage to the skillet, mixing it in well and cook 3 to 4 minutes longer. Cover the sauce and keep it warm while the malloreddus are cooking. Cook the malloreddus according to the directions on the package, until al dente. Drain and transfer them to a large bowl. Remove the bay leaf from the sauce before adding it to the malloreddus. Pour 2 cups of the sauce (freeze the rest) over the malloreddus, mix well, then transfer the mixture to a serving platter. Sprinkle the cheese over the top and serve immediately.
