Preheat the oven to 250°F/120°C (Gas Mark ½). Put the lamb, potatoes, parsley, and onions into a heavy casserole with a lid and season generously with salt and pepper. (Or layer the ingredients, starting and ending with a layer of potatoes, and seasoning each layer to taste.) Add 2 cups/475 ml of water or enough to barely cover the ingredients. Bring to a simmer over low heat (do not boil), then cover and put into the oven. Cook for 2½ to 3 hours or until the meat is very tender and the stew is thick, adding a little water if the stew dries out too much.
