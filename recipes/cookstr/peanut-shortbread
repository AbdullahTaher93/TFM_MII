In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Blend in the flour. Stir in the peanuts. On a lightly floured board, roll out the dough into about ½-by-2-inch rectangles, roughly. Transfer the cookies to baking sheets. Score the tops of the cookies in grid fashion with the edge of the paring knife. Place the baking sheets in the refrigerator for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375° F. Place the baking sheets in the oven and reduce the temperature to 325°. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden. Cool.
