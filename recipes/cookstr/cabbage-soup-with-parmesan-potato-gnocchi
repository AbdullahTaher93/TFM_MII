Heat the olive oil in a good-size soup pot over moderately high heat. Add the cabbage and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes; it’s fine if it browns a little. Sprinkle about ¼ teaspoon salt over the cabbage. Cover, reduce the heat to moderately low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Stir in the garlic during the last minute of cooking. Stir the beef stock, tomato puree, and bay leaf into the soup and season with pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 10 minutes, adding more salt, if necessary. Gently drop the gnocchi into the soup; push them down so they’re beneath the surface. Increase the heat and bring the soup to a low boil. When it reaches a low boil; cook the gnocchi for about 6 minutes. When they’re done, they’ll rise to the top of the liquid and look swollen. Serve the soup with some of the dumplings in each portion. Pass the cheese at the table, for garnish.
