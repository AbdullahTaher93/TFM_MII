Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, butter, sour cream and liqueur until well blended. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just blended. Divide half the batter equally among prepared muffin cups. Spoon 2 tsp (10 mL) of the chocolate-hazelnut spread in the center of each cup of batter. Top with the remaining batter. Bake in preheated oven for 21 to 25 minutes or until tops are firm and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes, then transfer to the rack to cool.
