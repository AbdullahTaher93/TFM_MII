Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and use a little of the butter to grease a 10-inch square baking pan. Mix the almond flour, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl. Place the chocolate and vanilla in a large bowl. In a saucepan, melt the remaining butter with the sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a simmer, pour over the chocolate in the bowl, and stir until the chocolate has melted. Add the eggs, beating well. Fold in the almond flour mixture, then fold in the raspberries. Spread in the baking pan. Place in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes, until fairly firm on top and a cake tester does not come out perfectly clean. Remove from the oven and cool, then refrigerate before cutting.
