1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, more to taste Preheat the oven to 375°F. Oil two rimmed baking sheets. Slice the eggplants in half lengthwise. Score the flesh in a crosshatch pattern and lightly sprinkle with salt. Brush the cut surface generously with oil and place the eggplant halves on the baking, sheets, cut side down. Brush the skins with oil. Bake, uncovered, until the flesh is tender and golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. While the eggplants bake, make the potato-vegetable filling. In a saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and stir in 1 teaspoon of the turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Heat the oil in a saucepan on medium-low heat. Cook the onions and garlic, sprinkled with salt, for about 10 minutes, covered, stirring occasionally. Add the carrots and a tablespoon of water, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the bell peppers and cook, covered, for 3 or 4 minutes. While the vegetables cook, mix together the cumin, coriander, cayenne, cloves, ginger, and the remaining 1 teaspoon of turmeric in a small bowl Stir the spice mixture into the vegetables and cook on low heat for a minute or two. Stir in the peas and cook, covered, until all of the vegetables are tender, 2 or 3 minutes. When the potatoes are done, drain them. In a large mixing bowl, mash the potatoes with the cream cheese and lemon juice. Add the vegetable mixture to the mashed potatoes and stir well. Add more salt and/or lemon juice to taste. When the eggplant halves are done, flip them over with a spatula and make a well in each by pushing the flesh to the sides a little. Mound some filling onto each eggplant half right out to 1/2-inch from the edges. Transfer them to clean, oiled baking sheets or pans. Bake at 350°F until piping hot, 20 to 30 minutes.
