Place 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) oil in a large heavy pot (see Tips, left). Heat over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 375째F (l90째C) (see Notes). Cut potatoes lengthwise into l/4-inch (0.5 cm) sticks. Carefully add a third of the chips to the oil and deep-fry for 4 to 5 minutes or until softened and just beginning to color. Using a slotted spoon or wire (spider) strainer, transfer to baking sheet lined with paper towels and let drain for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour before the second fry. Repeat with the remaining chips. Increase heat until thermometer registers 400째F (200째C). Carefully return a quarter of the chips to the oil and cook for a second time, stirring and turning occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes or until crisp and golden. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels and let drain briefly. Repeat with the remaining chips. Place hot chips in a big bowl and season to taste with salt. Serve immediately with aioli.
