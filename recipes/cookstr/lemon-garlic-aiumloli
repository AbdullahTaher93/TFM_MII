Soak the bread in the milk in a bowl for 1 minute. Squeeze the bread well to remove as much milk as possible and place it in a food processor along with the garlic and lemon zest. Pulse the machine on and off about 5 times to combine the ingredients. Add the mayonnaise and process until smooth. With the motor running, drizzle the olive oil through the feed tube and process until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate. This will keep for up to 2 days.
