Combine the purified water and sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the saffron. Cover and steep for 5 minutes. Whisk in the lemon juice and corn syrup. Cover and refrigerate until cold. Process the lemon mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Transfer the sorbet to a container. Stir to distribute the saffron evenly. Freeze until soft-solid, stirring occasionally, about 6 hours.
