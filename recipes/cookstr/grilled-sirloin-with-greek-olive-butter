Prepare coals for grilling. Pat the steak dry, coat lightly with the olive oil, and set aside. Combine the olives, oregano, and ouzo in a small bowl and whisk together. Add the butter and continue to whisk until the mixture is homogeneous. Refrigerate for to to 15 minutes if the butter is very soft. (Composed butter may be made ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator. Return to room temperature before serving.) Grill the steak until seared and nicely browned on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn, salt the meat, and cook for 4 minutes more for medium-rare or 5 minutes more for medium. Transfer the steak to a cutting board, let rest for 5 minutes, then cut it into 4 serving pieces. Slather 1 tablespoon of the composed butter on each piece and serve.
