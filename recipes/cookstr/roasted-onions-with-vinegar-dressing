Cut the onions in half crosswise. Place them in a bowl and add cold water to cover. Let stand for about 1 hour. Drain and pat dry. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with heavy-duty aluminum foil and coat with oil. Brush the onion halves all over with olive oil and place them on the prepared pan. Sprinkle with salt and roast until thoroughly tender and nicely browned, about 1 hour. Transfer to a serving dish. Sprinkle lightly with vinegar and generously with pepper to serve.
