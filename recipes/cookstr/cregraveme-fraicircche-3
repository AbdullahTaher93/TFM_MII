Combine the cream and buttermilk in a clean glass jar and cover it securely. Leave the jar in a warm place, such as over the pilot light or in the oven of a gas range or on a stove top of an electric range, for 6 to 8 hours, or until it thickens. It can be stored in the refrigerator (it will continue to thicken there), where it will keep for about 1 week.
