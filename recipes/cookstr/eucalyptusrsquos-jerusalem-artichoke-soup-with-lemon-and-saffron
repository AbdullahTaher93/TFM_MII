Using a heavy casserole with a cover, sauté the onions in the olive oil over low heat, covered, about 20 minutes. (This is called “sweating” the onions.) Uncover, add the garlic and the artichokes, and increase heat. Continue to sauté for a few more minutes. Add the chicken broth and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Grind the almonds in a spice grinder and mix with the water. Whisk the mixture into the soup along with the saffron strands and the lemon juice. Reheat, sprinkle parsley on top, and serve.
