Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until a piece of onion sizzles when added. Add the onions; cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until it turns white, 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms; cook until soft, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the barley to coat. Add the stock, salt, and turmeric; bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the barley is tender and liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat. Stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano, pepper, and butter. Serve with lemon wedges.
