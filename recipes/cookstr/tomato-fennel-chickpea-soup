In a stockpot, heat the oil and saut√© the carrots, onions, garlic, and celery for 7 minutes, or until soft. Add the oregano, fennel seeds, and two thirds of the sliced fennel. Cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the fennel is soft. Add the tomatoes, rosemary, bay leaves, 2 quarts of the chickpea cooking liquid, wine, if using, and the salt. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 40 minutes, loosely covered. Remove the soup from the heat and fish out the rosemary sprigs and bay leaves. Puree the soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Add the remaining sliced fennel and the chickpeas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the fennel is tender but still crisp. If the soup is too thick, add water as desired. Season with salt and pepper.
