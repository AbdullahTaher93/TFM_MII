Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except ½ cup of the tomato sauce and the mozzarella and mix well. Turn the mixture into a lightly sprayed or oiled 9-by-5-inch loaf pan and gently pat down. Bake for 45 minutes. Spread the remaining tomato sauce on the top of the loaf and sprinkle with mozzarella. Bake until the cheese melts and the sauce is warmed, about 10 minutes longer. Let stand in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Remove the loaf from the pan and slice to serve. To make dried bread crumbs: Spread the fresh breed crumbs on a baking sheet and let dry in a 200°F oven for about 20 minutes or on the counter overnight.
