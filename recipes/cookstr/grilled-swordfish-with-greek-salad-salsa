Combine the garlic, lemon juice, 6 tablespoons of the olive oil, and the oregano in a large plastic bag with a resealable closure. Add the swordfish and marinate in the refrigerator, turning the bag over once or twice, for 1 to 2 hours. Toss the tomatoes with the salt and drain in a colander for 15 minutes. Pat dry on paper towels. Soak the red onion in ice water for 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Combine the tomatoes, onion, cucumber, olives, radishes, feta, capers, vinegar, and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large bowl. Toss well and season with salt and pepper. You should have about 3 cups. Prepare a charcoal fire and allow the coals to burn down to a gray ash. Lightly oil the grill and set about 4 inches from the coals. (Alternatively, preheat a large well-oiled grill pan or preheat the broiler and set a broiling pan about 4 inches from the heat.) Remove the sword-fish from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill or broil until lightly browned and slightly firm to the touch, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Serve on warmed plates topped with a spoonful of the salsa. Garnish each plate with a pinch of the shredded basil. Serve the remaining salsa on the side.
