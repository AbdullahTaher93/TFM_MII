In a skillet, heat the olive oil, add the pancetta, and saute until the pancetta starts to shrivel. Add the onion and continue to saute until the onion is soft. Add the red pepper flakes and saute for several minutes. Then add the tomatoes, salt, and pepper and simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 minutes. Keep the sauce warm. In a large pot of boiling water, cook the bucatini until al dente. Drain the bucatini well, place it in a serving bowl, and toss with half the sauce. Sprinkle on the cheese and serve at once, passing additional sauce on the side.
