Cut chicken legs into drumsticks and thighs. In large deep skillet or shallow ovenproof casserole, heat oil over medium-high heat; brown chicken in batches, sprinkling lightly with salt and pepper. Remove and set aside. Drain off all but 2 tbsp (25 mL) drippings from pan. Add onions, red pepper, hot pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to taste; cook over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add garlic, prosciutto and sun-dried tomatoes; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add rice and stir well to coat. Add tomatoes and wine; bring to boil, scraping up any brown bits from bottom of pan. Top with chicken; tuck orange wedges and olives around pieces. Cover and bake in 350°F (180°C) oven for 1 hour or until juices run clear when chicken is pierced.
