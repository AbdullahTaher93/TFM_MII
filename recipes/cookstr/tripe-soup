Place the tripe in a large stockpot with 2 quarts of heavily salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Drain under cold running water. Return the tripe to the pot and add the onion, cloves, peppercorns, and garlic. Add 2 quarts of cold water and bring to a boil. Cook at a high simmer for 30 minutes. Add the stock and continue to cook for 2Â½ hours, or until the tripe is very tender. Add the vegetables and herbs and simmer for 15 minutes. Check the seasonings. Serve immediately in heated bowls.
