Put all the ingredients into a large pot and add enough cold water to cover completely. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2Â½ hours, skimming any foam that forms on the surface. Strain the stock, discarding the solids. Rinse out the pot, then return the stock to it and simmer for about 30 minutes longer. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate or freeze in several containers. If desired, refrigerate for about 3 hours, until the fat rises to the top and solidifies, then remove the far before freezing.
