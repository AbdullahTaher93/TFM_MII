Wash and peel the potatoes. Grate with a fine grater and drain off all the liquid that collects in the bowl. Grate the onion into the potato and mix in the egg, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper. Heat the butter (1 teaspoon at a time) in a large skillet or griddle. Put in four large spoonfuls of the mixture to make 4 pancakes. Cook gently until brown on the bottom, turn, and brown on the other side. Add more fat and continue cooking until all are done.
