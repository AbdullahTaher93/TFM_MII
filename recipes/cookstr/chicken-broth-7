In a large stockpot or Dutch oven, add water to cover chicken. Bring to a boil and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes, occasionally skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Add onion, celery, carrots, parsnip, garlic, salt and pepper. Return to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper as required. Add parsley and dill; cover and simmer for another 30 minutes. Remove chicken and reserve for another use, if desired (see Notes). Strain stock through a sieve lined with cheesecloth, discarding solids. Allow stock to cool, then refrigerate. Once chilled, remove congealed fat from surface. Portion stock in 2Â½- to 3-cup (625 to 750 mL) portions for use in fondues. Freeze if desired.
