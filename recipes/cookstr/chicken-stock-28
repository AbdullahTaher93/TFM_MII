Place the carcass in a large pot of water over high heat. Add the base in whatever proportions it instructs on the jar. Then add the vegetables and trimmings. Boil the stock for about 2 hours, until the meat falls off the bones. Strain, discarding everything but the liquid. This will last for several days in the refrigerator or for months in the freezer. To make your own base, the next time youâ€™re making chicken stock, boil it for 3 to 4 hours, until it is thick and concentrated and almost jelly-like. Strain it, pour it into ice cube trays, and freeze it. Use those stock cubes instead of base the next time you are making chicken stock.
