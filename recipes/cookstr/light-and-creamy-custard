Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Mix together all eggs and yolks, sugar, and vanilla in a mixing bowl until well blended. Heat milk in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until hot. Pour hot milk slowly into egg mixture, stirring continuously. Make caramel sauce: Heat sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling pan frequently, until mixture begins to turn light nut color; watch carefully because it will turn very quickly. Pour caramel sauce immediately into an 8 x 8 x 2-inch (20 x 20 x 5-cm) baking pan, swirling it around to coat bottom. It is okay if the pan is not completely coated. Pour egg mixture through a strainer into baking pan. Place pan into a larger baking pan with 1-inch (2.5-cm) sides. Fill larger pan halfway with water to create water bath. Bake 1½ hours or until firm to the touch. Let cool at room temperature and serve, or refrigerate for a firmer custard. VARIATION Coconut custard with rum: Instead of 4 cups (1 L) milk, use 2 cups (500 ml) coconut milk and 2 cups (500 ml) milk, and use 1 tablespoon dark rum instead of vanilla extract.
