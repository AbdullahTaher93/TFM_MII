Prepare a large bowl or pan of ice water. To make the Truffles: In the top of a double boiler, heat the chocolate, cream, and butter over simmering water, stirring until smooth. Stir in the framboise. Transfer to a small container and let cool. Cover and refrigerate until cold and firm, about 1 hour. Scoop out ½-teaspoon portions and drop them onto an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. In a bowl, whisk together ½ cup of the half-and-half, the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. In a small saucepan, bring the remaining ¼ cups half-and-half just to a boil over medium heat. Whisk in the sugar mixture and boil until thickened, about 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool to 110°F on a candy thermometer, Place the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl and pour the hot half-and-half over it. Stir until the chocolate is melted. Place the bowl in the ice bath and stir the mixture occasionally until it cools to room temperature. Stir in the cream and vanilla, cover, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 3 hours. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When the ice cream is almost frozen, spoon in the framboise, if desired, and churn until blended in, about 1 minute more, Add the chocolate truffles and churn until blended in, about 15 seconds more. Transfer to a container, cover, and freeze until firm, about 2 hours.
