Cut the avocados into bite-size chunks and set aside. Fill the bottom of chilled individual glasses or serving bowls with lettuce and arrange the shrimp and avocado on top. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the bitter orange juice, ketchup, and onion. Gradually whisk in the oil. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the tomatoes, chiles, and minced cilantro. Spoon the sauce over the shrimp and avocado. Garnish with cilantro sprigs and serve.
