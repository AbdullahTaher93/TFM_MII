Put all the ingredients into a stockpot, and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Set the cover askew, turn on the heat to medium, and bring to a boil. As soon as the liquid starts to boil, turn down the heat so that it bubbles steadily at the gentlest of simmers. Skim off the scum that floats to the surface, fairly frequently at first, then only from time to time. Cook for 3 hours, at no time more rapidly than at a simmer. Strain the broth through a large wine strainer lined with paper towels, pouring it into a nonmetallic bowl. Allow to cool completely, uncovered. When cool, place in the refrigerator long enough for the fat to come to the surface and solidify. Remove the fat and pour the clear broth into ice-cube trays. Freeze. When the broth is frozen solid, un mold the cubes from the trays and divide them into 4 or 5 small plastic bags. Seal the bags tightly, and return to the freezer to keep until needed.
