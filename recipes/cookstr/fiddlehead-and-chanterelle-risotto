Melt the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until translucent, for about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and stir until well coated with butter. Cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Add the tarragon and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. The mushrooms should be reduced to about 2 cups. Set aside. In a heavy 12-inch casserole, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the rice and cook, stirring fairly constantly, until all the grains have become opaqueâ€”white if using arborio. Pour in the Champagne or wine. Cook, stirring, until the liquid is almost evaporated. Add 1 cup of the stock and cook, stirring, until almost absorbed. Continue to add the stock in 1-cup amounts, stirring and letting the rice absorb the liquid each time. After 4 cups have been added, stir in the peas, then add another cup of stock. When it has been absorbed, stir in the fiddleheads. Add the remaining cup of stock and the chanterelle mixture. When the liquid is almost absorbed, add the Parmesan, salt and pepper. Serve from the pan or transfer to serving dishes. Sprinkle with the chive flowers.
