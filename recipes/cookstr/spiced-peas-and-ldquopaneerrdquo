In a large, heavy pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and cardamom and cook until the seeds sizzle, about 30 seconds. Add the onion and cook until browned, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the ginger root and garlic. Cook for another minute, stirring to avoid sticking. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, chiles, 1 cup of the water, garam masala, coriander, red chile powder, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick and cardamom. Blend the mixture, either using an immersion blender or by transferring it to a blender or food processor. (This step is not necessary, but it adds smoothness to your final dish.) Add the peas, baked tofu cubes, and remaining 2 cups (474 ml.) water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes, uncovered. Garnish with the cilantro. Serve with brown or white basmati rice, roti, or noon.
