Line the bottom of a 9 inch (23 cm) spring form pan with parchment paper. Butter the paper and sides of the pan well, and dust with flour. Pour hot water over the almonds so that they are well covered and leave them to soak for about 4 hours. (Remove the skins-they should slip right off.) Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C) and place a rack on the middle level. Chop the nuts roughly and grind them a little at a time in a coffee/spice grinder. They should be neither too coarse nor too fine. Set aside. Beat the egg whites until they are fluffy. Add the salt and continue beating until they are firm. Add the yolks one by one and continue beating until they are all incorporated. Mix the dry ingredients with the almonds and, beating at a low speed, gradually add them to the eggs. Add the brandy and almond extract and pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 1¾ hours. Remove the cake from the pan or cool on a rack.
