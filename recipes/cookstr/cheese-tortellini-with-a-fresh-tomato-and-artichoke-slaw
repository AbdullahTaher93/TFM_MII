Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add salt, is using, and stir in the tortellini. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook the tortellini, uncovered, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Meanwhile, place the artichoke hearts with their liquid, basil, and tomatoes in a food processor. Pulse 10 times, or until the mixture has a slaw-like consistency. Stir in the capers. Drain the tortellini well in a colander, shaking it a few times to remove any water that might still cling to the pasta. Transfer the tortellini to a serving bowl or serving plates. Pour the slaw over the tortellini and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top. Serve at once. 3.
