Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine the water and flaxseed meal and allow to thicken for 3 to 5 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and xanthan gum. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the shortening, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add in the vanilla and the flaxseed meal mixture, and beat until it is fluffy and the flaxseed is thoroughly mixed in. Add in the flour mixture and mix the batter until thoroughly combined. Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of the dough into the confectioners sugar, rolling the cookies around to form balls. Place the balls 2 inches apart, to allow for spreading, on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 14 minutes or until the tops of the cookies no longer look wet Transfer the baking sheets from the oven to cooling racks and cool for 10 minutes, then transfer the cookies directly onto the racks to cool completely. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
