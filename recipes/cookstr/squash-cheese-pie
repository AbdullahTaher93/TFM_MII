Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Heat the 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook the onions, stirring, until golden and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the squash and water and simmer, covered, over medium-low heat until the squash is soft but not mushy, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a large bowl, combine the beaten eggs, cheeses, and black pepper. Mix well. Pour half of the cheese mixture into a separate large bowl. Fold the cooked squash gently into the mixture in one of the bowls. Coat a 9-inch glass or other ovenproof baking dish with vegetable oil. Pour in the squash-cheese mixture. Spread the remaining half of the cheese mixture on top and sprinkle with paprika for color. (May be refrigerated at this point and baked later in the day or frozen. It will keep for 4 to 5 days in the refrigerator, 3 to 4 weeks in the freezer. Defrost before baking.) Place the pie in the center of the oven and bake until the top is brown and the center is firm when pierced with a knife, 50 to 60 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Can be served hot or cold, with each serving topped with a dollop of Yogurt-Mint Dressing.
