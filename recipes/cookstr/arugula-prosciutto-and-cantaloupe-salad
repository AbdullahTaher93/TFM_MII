Put the vinegar in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in the oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. (The dressing can be made 1 day ahead, covered, and stored at room temperature.) Cut the cantaloupe in half, and save one half for another use. Peel the cantaloupe and scoop out the seeds. Cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices, then cut each slice crosswise into thirds. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Toss the arugula and vinaigrette in a large serving bowl. Add the cantaloupe and toss lightly. Cut the prosciutto (including the fat) into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Scatter over the top of the salad and toss again. Season with pepper and serve immediately.
