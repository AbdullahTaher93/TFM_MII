Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Drop the rice into the boiling salted water and boil for 5 minutes exactly. Drain immediately. Melt the butter in the casserole. When the butter is foaming in the casserole, stir in the onions. As soon as they are well coated with butter, stir in the rice and seasonings. Cover and cook very slowly in the 300-degree oven for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The rice and onions should become very tender and will usually turn a light golden yellow. Correct seasoning. May be cooked several hours in advance and reheated later. Just before serving, stir in the cream and cheese, and then the butter. Taste again for seasoning. Turn into a hot vegetable dish and sprinkle with parsley.
