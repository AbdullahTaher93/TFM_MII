Preheat the oven to 350°F and butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. TO MAKE THE CRUST: Cut the butter into chunks and place in a food processor. Add the confectioners’ sugar, flour, and salt. Process until a firm, slightly crumbly dough forms. Press into the bottom of the buttered pan. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F when you remove the bars from the oven. TO MAKE THE FILLING: Finely grate the zest of 1 of the lemons and squeeze the juice from all the lemons. You should have about ¾ cup of juice, and you’ll need 1 teaspoon of the grated zest; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, lightly beat the eggs. Beat in the granulated sugar, flour, salt, milk, and lemon zest. Add the lemon juice and beat well. When the crust has cooled for about 10 minutes, pour the filling over the top. Return the pan to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the filling is set and the bars are golden brown. When the pan has cooled, generously dust with confectioners’ sugar and cut into bars. Store in the refrigerator, tightly covered in a single layer, for up to 2 days.
