Stir the flour, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Mix 1½ cups tepid water with the oil, and pour into the well. Stir to make a soft dough. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface for about 8 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Place in an oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour. Knead the dough briefly on a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, and shape each into a ball. Place onto the baking sheet, well separated. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in warm place about 30 minutes, until puffy. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly brush the rolls with the beaten egg and sprinkle each with ½ tsp sesame seeds. Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
