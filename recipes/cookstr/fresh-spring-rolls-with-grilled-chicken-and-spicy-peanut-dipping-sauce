1 Fill a large bowl with cold water. Immerse 1 piece of rice paper in the water for about 5 seconds. Set on a clean dish towel on a large work space and let rest until pliable, about 20 seconds; if itâ€™s still tough, using your fingers, spread a little more water over it. Top the rice paper with a small handful of noodles, some of the chicken, some mint, scallions, red pepper, and carrots. Roll the rice paper away from you, tucking the edges into the center so the paper wraps the filling into a tight, rectangular bundle. Set on a large platter and repeat with the remaining 11 sheets of rice paper and filling. Place all the peanut sauce ingredients except the water in a food processor and process until combined. With the machine running, add the water and process until smooth. To serve, slice the rolls in half on the diagonal. Set on a serving platter and serve with the peanut sauce for dipping.
