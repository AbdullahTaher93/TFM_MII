In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil, garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes over medium heat until the garlic sizzles and just begins to color, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Put the bocconcini in a bowl and cover with the seasoned oil. Add the capers and parsley. Stir to coat. Cover and let stand for several hours, stirring occasionally. Just before serving, season to taste with salt. Arrange the bocconcini on a serving platter. Surround with the tomatoes and olives. Spoon some of the marinade over the tomatoes.
