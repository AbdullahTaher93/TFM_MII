Rinse the orange and lime in several changes of boiling water to remove the wax. Cut each in half, and then into very thin slices. Place the orange and lime slices, mango, cranberries, garlic, onion, apple, ginger, and brown sugar in the insert of the slow cooker. Cover and cook on HIGH for 4 to 6 hours, or until the cranberries have burst and all the ingredients are soft. Turn the slow cooker off, remove the cover, and let the chutney cool in the insert. Store the cooled chutney in a tightly covered sterilized container in the refrigerator for up to 6 months. Serve chilled or at room temperature as a condiment for poultry or meat.
