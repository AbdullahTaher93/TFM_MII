Preheat the oven to 275°F (140°C). Heat the cream and vanilla bean in a saucepan over low heat until simmering. Remove from the heat and let stand for 1 hour. Using the tip of a knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the cream. Discard the bean or save for another use. Whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar together in a bowl. Whisk in the cream mixture. Strain through a wire sieve into a glass measuring cup. Pour equal amounts into six 6 oz (175ml) ramekins. Place the ramekins in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides. Bake until the custards are barely set, about 40 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the pan and cool. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator at least 2 hours. To serve, position a broiler rack 6 in (15cm) from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Sprinkle 2 tsp demerara sugar evenly over the top of each custard. Broil until the sugar caramelizes. Serve immediately. Variations: Fruit Brûlée: Put a spoonful of soft berries or cooked fruit (apricots, rhubarb) in the bottom of each ramekin before adding the custard. Ginger Brûlée: Replace the vanilla pod with 3 tbsp minced stem ginger in syrup. Chcocolate Brûlée Omit the vanilla. Add 3½ oz (100g) grated white or dark chocolate to the hot milk and stir until melted.
