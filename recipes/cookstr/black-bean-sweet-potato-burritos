In a covered saucepan, bring the sweet potatoes to a boil in salted water to cover. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well. Mash. Set aside. While the sweet potatoes are cooking, in a covered saucepan on low heat warm the oil. Add the onions, garlic, hot peppers, and salt and cook until the onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cumin and coriander and cook for another minute or two. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly oil a large baking pan. Combine the mashed sweet potatoes, the onion-spice mixture, and the black beans. Stir in the lemon juice and cilantro. Season with salt to taste. Place about 1 cup of filling on the bottom half of each tortilla and roll up. The sides can be left open, or the sides can be folded over as you roll to form a tidy package. Arrange, seam side down, in the prepared baking pan. Lightly brush the tops of the burritos with oil and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until hot.
