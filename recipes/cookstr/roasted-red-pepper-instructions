To roast the peppers over a gas burner, set them directly in the flame. Turn them every few minutes so that the entire surface is exposed to the flame and the skin is eventually charred all over. Set the finished peppers in a bowl, cover it with a plate, and allow it to stand for at least 10 minutes to steam. Carefully scrape away the charred peel with a knife. Save any of the syrupy juices that collect in the bottom of the bowl. Cut open the pepper, scrape out the seeds, cut the flesh into strips, and add them to the bowl with the juices. Toss with the olive oil, add the garlic, and season lightly with salt, pepper, and vinegar, to taste. Store in a covered jar in the refrigerator. To roast peppers in an electric oven, set them on the top rack, right under the heat, turn them frequently until they are completely charred, then treat as above. Another way to roast peppers in the oven is to cut them in half, brush them with light oil on both sides and set them, cut side down, on a cookie sheet, in a hot oven (400°F). After ten minutes or so the skins will be wrinkled and loose. Set the pepper halves in a covered bowl to steam then treat as above or use them to cook With. Since they haven’t been charred, they won’t have that smoky flavor, but they will be softened by the cooking and the skins will be easy to remove.
