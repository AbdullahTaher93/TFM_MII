Put the golden raisins and orange juice in a small bowl and leave to soak. Put half of the olive oil into a small bowl with the saffron and leave to infuse. Trim the cauliflower and divide into florets. Blanch in a pan of boiling water for up to three minutes, until just tender. Drain and set aside. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. In a 3-quart pan, saut√© the onion in the remaining oil until soft, then add the garlic and the cauliflower. Cook for a further three minutes, then reduce the heat, sprinkle the paprika into the mixture and pour in the saffron and the oil. Stir thoroughly to coat the vegetables, then add the vinegar and cook for another three minutes. Finally add the golden raisins and orange juice. Stir to combine and continue to cook until the liquid is reduced. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.
