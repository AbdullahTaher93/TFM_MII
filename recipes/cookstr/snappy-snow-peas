Sliver green onions Japanese-styleâ€”trim roots and any wilted tops from onions, and then cut each in 2-inch lengths. Cut onion pieces lengthwise in thin slivers. Set aside. Heat oil in a wok or large, shallow skillet. Add snow peas, green onions, ginger, and bell peppers. Stir-fry 3 to 4 minutes, sprinkle with soy sauce, and continue to cook until hot and just barely render-crisp. Sprinkle with ground chile, stir to mix, and serve hot.
