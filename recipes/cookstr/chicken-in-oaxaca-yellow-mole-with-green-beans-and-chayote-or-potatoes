In a blender jar, combine the torn guajillo chiles, tomatoes, onion, garlic, spices, oregano and 1 cup of the chicken broth. Blend until as smooth as possible. (A food processor will work, but it won’t completely puree the chile.) In a medium-large (4- to 6- quart) heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high. Set a medium-mesh strainer over the top and pour in the chile mixture; press the mixture through the strainer into the hot oil. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is reduced to the consistency of tomato paste, about 5 minutes. Whisk the masa harina into the remaining 3 cups broth, then pour into the cooked chile mixture. Whisk until the sauce comes to a boil and thickens to the consistency of a light cream soup. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the chicken, green beans, chayote or potatoes and 1 teaspoon salt. Simmer gently, stirring regularly, for about 20 minutes, until all the chicken and vegetables are tender. Add the hoja santa or cilantro, then taste and season with salt, usually between ½ and 1 teaspoon, depending on the saltiness of your chicken broth, and serve.
