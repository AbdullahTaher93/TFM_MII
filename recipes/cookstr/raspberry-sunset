Divide the crushed berries among four tall glasses and fill to the rim with ice. Combine the yuzu juice, lemon juice, lime juice, agave, and sake in a pitcher, bowl, or other container and mix well. Pour the liquid over the ice and berries. Top off each glass with the sparkling white wine, and garnish with mint sprigs.
