Heat the butter in a wok over medium heat. Pour the eggs into the wok, and stir gently for 1 minute to create large curds. Sprinkle the chives and chervil over the eggs and lightly season with salt and pepper. Lay the slices of Brie on one side of the eggs. Continue cooking the omelet until the eggs are just set, about 2 minutes. Gently fold the omelet over the Brie-covered half to encase the cheese. Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve with roasted potatoes or toast.
