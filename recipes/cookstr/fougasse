At least 6 hours before baking the fougasse, make a starter. Stir 1 1/3 cups of the flour, the yeast, and 2/3 cup water together in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place for at least 4 hours, until the starter rises, then falls. Add 1 1/3 cups flour, the salt, 2/3 cup water, and 4 tbsp olive oil to the starter and stir to make a soft dough. Knead on a lightly floured work surface until the dough is smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat, then cover again. Let stand for about 1 hour, until doubled. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and bacon and cook about 6 minutes, until the bacon is browned. Transfer to a plate and cool. Turn out the dough on a floured work surface and knead in the bacon mixture. Divide the dough into 3 balls. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 10 minutes. Roll each ball into a round about ½ in (1cm) thick. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Put each round on a baking sheet. Cut each round twice down the center, then cut 3 diagonal slits on either side of the center cuts. Cut all the way through the dough, but not through the edges. Brush with olive oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let stand for about 45 minutes, or until doubled. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Bake for 15 minutes, until golden. Let cool on wire racks before serving.
