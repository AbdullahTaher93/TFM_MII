Roll out the pastry to about 1/8 inches thick and 13 inches in diameter. Leave to rest in the fridge on a floured plate, folded if necessary, for about 15 minutes. Cook the onion and garlic in the olive oil for a few minutes. Cut the potatoes into small dice and add to the onion. Season with salt and pepper and cover with a lid. Gently cook the potatoes, stirring frequently, for about 20 minutes until they are soft. Add the frozen peas and mint and cook for a further 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Take the pastry from the fridge and cut it into 12 discs of about 4-inch diameter, re-rolling as necessary to use all the trimmings. Rest the pastry again if you have time as this helps prevent cracking and shrinkage when cooking. To fill the pastry, brush the edge of pastry circles with a little water or milk and place about ½ tablespoon of the pea mixture in the center of each one. Fold up two sides of the pastry and pinch in the middle to seal, then fold up one other side, creating two seams and press the pastry together. Repeat on the other side so you have a square shape with four sealed lines. Alternatively fold over the pastry and seal down one side to make a half-moon shape. Place the pasties on a baking sheet and brush with a little more water or milk to glaze. Cook in the oven for about 20 minutes until the pastry is cooked and golden brown. Serve after resting for about 10 minutes. Don’t worry if the parcels break their seal—they are just as tasty!
