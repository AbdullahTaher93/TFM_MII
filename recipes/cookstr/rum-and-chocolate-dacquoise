Preheat the oven to 250°F (130°C). Draw three 7in (18cm) diameter circles on 2 pieces of parchment paper. Turn the papers upside down onto 2 baking sheets. To make the meringue, mix the granulated and brown sugars together. Beat the egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the sugars until the meringue is stiff and shiny. Using a metal icing spatula, spread the meringue evenly within the circles. Bake about 1½ hours, or until crisp and dry. Cool completely. To make the filling, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Beat the mascarpone and sugar together, then mix in the chocolate. Whip the cream just until it holds its shape and fold into the mascarpone mixture. Fold in the hazelnuts, cherries, and rum. Place a meringue round on a serving platter and spread with half of the filling. Repeat with another meringue and the filling, then the final meringue. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Sift confectioner's sugar over the dacquoise and serve.
