Lightly rub the poblano with oil and roast over a gas flame or under a broiler until blackened all over, turning occasionally. Transfer the chile to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let steam until collapsed and cool. Peel, seed, and finely chop the chile. In a medium-size bowl, combine the poblano, mango, corn, onion, lime juice, cilantro, and chives. Season with salt and pepper. Will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
