Coat a stovetop grill pan or griddle with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, thread alternating pieces of chicken and zucchini onto the skewers. Brush them with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the skewers on the hot grill pan and cook until the chicken is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes total, turning frequently. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the spicy ketchup ingredients. Set the pan over medium heat, bring to a simmer, and continue to simmer until the raisins plump up, about 5 minutes. Serve the spicy ketchup alongside the skewers for dunking.
