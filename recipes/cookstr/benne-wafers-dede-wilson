. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper and coat lightly with nonstick spray. Beat the butter in a medium-size bowl with a wooden spoon. Add brown sugar, and stir vigorously to combine, Beat in egg until combined. Add sesame seeds, flour, vanilla, and salt, and stir until combined. Drop onto cookie sheets by ¼ teaspoonfuls at least 2 inches apart. Bake until medium golden brown, about 7 minutes. They will have spread to about 1½ inches in diameter and have become crisp around the edges, although the golden brown color, will be uniform over the whole cookie. They will firm up upon cooling, however, and will still be soft in the middle even when fully cooked. Place sheets on racks and let cookies cool.
