Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Coat a 10-inch round glass or porcelain pie pan evenly with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over low heat and reserve. Using an electric mixer set at high speed, beat the eggs with the sugar and reserved melted butter until the mixture is thickened and a light lemon color, about 3 minutes. Add the flour and vanilla and mix until thoroughly blended. Set aside for 15 minutes. Arrange the cherries over the bottom of the buttered pie pan. Pour the batter evenly over the cherries. Bake for 45 minutes until golden and puffy. Serve at room temperature with the whipped cream.
