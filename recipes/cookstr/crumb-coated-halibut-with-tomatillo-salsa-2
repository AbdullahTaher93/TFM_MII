To Make the Tomatillo Salsa: Pour about an inch of water into a saucepan with a lid and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, husk the tomatillos, rinse, and cut the larger ones to be the same size as the others for even cooking. Cook the tomatillos for 5 to 7 minutes, until fork-tender. Drain, reserving some of the liquid. Place the tomatillos, jalapeno, onion, and cilantro in a blender of food processor and process until pureed, adding reserved juice as desired for consistency. To Make the Crumb-Coated Halibut: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse the fish and pat dry, then place on an aluminum foil-covered baking sheet. Top each steak with a squeeze of lemon juice from half the lemon. Mix the bread crumbs and chile together, then sprinkle on the top, bottom, and side of each filet. Drizzle the oil over the top of each. Place in the oven and bake until the fish flakes easily (approximately 8 to 10 minutes) when pierced with a fork. Cut the remaining half lemon lengthwise into quarters. Serve the fish napped with salsa and a lemon wedge.
