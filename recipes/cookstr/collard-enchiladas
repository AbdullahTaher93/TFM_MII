Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). In a saucepan, combine the water and brown rice. Bring to a boil, cover, and lower the heat to medium. Cook for 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Once the rice is done, add the cilantro and the lime juice and set aside. In a skillet, sauté the squash and beans with the garlic, onion flakes, oregano, and paprika. Combine all the sauce ingredients in a blender. Blend them until smooth and transfer to a saucepan. Heat the sauce for 5 minutes over medium-low heat. Lay the collard greens flat. Spoon the rice and bean mixture onto the collard greens. Roll them up like small burritos. Place the enchiladas side by side in a glass baking dish and cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake the enchiladas for 30 minutes. Pour the sauce over the enchiladas halfway through the baking time. Serve hot.
