Put the asparagus in a pan of boiling salted water and boil for 2-3 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Place the beans and asparagus tips in a small salad bowl and add the mint. Pour on the olive oil and add some salt and pepper. Add the cheese. Eat in a balmy garden with a few fat blowsy bumblebees nearby, but not close enough to harass you.
