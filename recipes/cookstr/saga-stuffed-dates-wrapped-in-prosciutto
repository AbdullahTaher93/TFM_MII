Slit each date lengthwise and remove the pit. Slice each date into two equal lengthwise pieces. Combine the Saga Blue and cream cheese, and season with black pepper. Use a small spreader to fill each date half with the cheese, spreading it out flush with rim of the fruit. Trim off any excess fat from each piece of prosciutto using kitchen scissors. If the slices are very long, cut them in half widthwise. Lay a stuffed date at one end of a slice of prosciutto and roll it up, enclosing it completely. Place in a single layer on a serving platter.
