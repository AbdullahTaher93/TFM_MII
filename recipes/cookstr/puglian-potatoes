Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In an enameled cast-iron pot, pour half the olive oil and spread it around to cover the bottom of the pot. Layer 1/3 of the sliced onions in the bottom of the pot, add a layer of potatoes and a layer of tomatoes, and sprinkle with some breadcrumbs, cheese, salt, and red pepper flakes. Continue layering, finishing with a layer of bread crumbs, cheese, and red pepper flakes. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil, pour in enough water to come halfway up the layered vegetables, and bake for about 1½ hours, or until the potatoes are soft. Serve drizzled with some Olio Santo for heat and spiciness.
