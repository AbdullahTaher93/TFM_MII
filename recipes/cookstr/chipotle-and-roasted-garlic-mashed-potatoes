Bring about an inch of salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Drain well, then add the butter. Cover and let stand while preparing the garlic. Slice off the root end of the garlic. With the blunt edge of a knife, squeeze the garlic from the husk; mince and set aside. Warm the milk for about 30 seconds. Mash the potatoes using a masher, slowly adding milk and mashing until the potatoes are fluffy. Fold in the minced chiles and garlic. Serve hot. 3.
