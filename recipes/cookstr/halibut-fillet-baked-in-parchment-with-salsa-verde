Make the salsa verde: Slice the crusts off the bread and discard. Place the bread on a small plate and drizzle both sides with the red wine vinegar. Soak the anchovies in a bowl of cold water for 30 minutes. Remove the bones and reserve the fillets. In a marble mortar, combine the anchovies, garlic, and capers. Pound the mixture into a paste. Add the bread and parsley and pound to a fine paste. Slowly pour in the olive oil, stirring constantly until all the oil is incorporated. Add salt to taste, if necessary. Prepare the halibut: Preheat the oven to 360 degrees. Cut 4 sheets of parchment paper into 6 12-inch squares on a work surface. Place two sprigs of rosemary in the center of each piece of parchment, then place a halibut fillet on top of the rosemary sprigs. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Bring the front and back of each piece of parchment together over the centers of each fillet. Gently fold together 3 times and then fold the ends of the paper under the packets. Place the packets in a heavy-duty baking pan and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the fish from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. To serve, unfold the parchment papers and gently slide a spatula under the fillets, lifting each one onto an individual serving plate. Spoon several tablespoons of salsa verde on top.
