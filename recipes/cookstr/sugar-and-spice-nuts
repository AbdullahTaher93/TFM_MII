Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Combine the sugar, spices, and salt in a bowl. Stir well and set aside. In a separate bowl, toss the nuts with the egg white to coat them. Then add the sugar-and-spice mixture and mix well. Spread the coated nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. You may need to use your fingers to separate the nuts as much as possible. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and use a metal spatula to scrape up the nuts and break them apart. Return the nuts to the oven for 5 minutes more to dry them thoroughly. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and shake it to break up the nuts. Let the nuts sit on the baking sheet in a cool dry place for 1 hour to cool and harden. (Stored in a tin in a cool dry place, the nuts will keep for up to 2 weeks.)
