Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut new potatoes into ¼-inch slices. Peel and chop the garlic cloves. Mix the potatoes and chopped garlic together in a roasting pan large enough to hold the bluefish fillets. Toss with half of the olive oil. Tear the basil leaves into thin strips and add to the potato-garlic mixture. Toss with the salt and pepper to taste. Put the roasting pan into the oven for about 20 minutes, baking the potatoes until they are just golden. Remove from the oven and lift out the potatoes and set aside briefly. Place the bluefish fillets in the roasting pan and drizzle with lemon juice. Pour the remaining olive oil over the fillets. Add the water and wine to the pan, surrounding the fish. Cover the fish with the potato mixture. Return the filled roasting pan to the oven and bake for about another 10 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked and the fish can be separated easily with a fork, but is still moist. . To serve, divide the fish among plates and serve with the potatoes on the side.
