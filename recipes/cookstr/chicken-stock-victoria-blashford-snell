Combine the chicken, celery, and onion in a large saucepan with 2 qts (2 liters) cold water. Bring just to a boil over high heat. Using a large spoon, skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to low and add the parsley, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and peppercorns. Partially cover the saucepan. Simmer for at least 1 and up to 3 hours. Strain the stock into a large bowl. Let stand 10 minutes, then skim the fat from the surface. Use immediately, or cool completely and refrigerate or freeze. Variation: Turkey Stock: Substitute 2 turkey wings for the chicken wings. Add the neck and giblets (but not the liver) from 1 turkey, if available.
