Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and rice and stir until both are translucent, about 7 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, spinach, and Â½ cup water. Cover, reduce the heat, and cook until the rice is soft and the liquid has been absorbed, about 12 minutes. Add more water if the liquid is absorbed before the rice is cooked. Stir in the remaining ingredients and remove from the heat. Fluff with a fork and serve. VARIATION: Rice Pilaf with Shrimp, Squid, or Snails: To make a seafood or snail pilaf, instead of the spinach use 1 cup raw small shrimp, 1 cup cleaned squid cut into rings, or 2 cups canned snails. Cook the rice as described, stirring in the tomatoes and water as described in Step 2. Stir in the shrimp during the last 3 minutes, or the squid during the last 5 minutes of cooking time. If using snails, add them to the skillet with the onion and rice.
