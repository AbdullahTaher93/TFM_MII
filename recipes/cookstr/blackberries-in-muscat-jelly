Divide the blackberries among 6 glasses; I use old-fashioned champagne saucers with a yield of about ¾ cup each. Soak the gelatin sheets in a dish of cold water for 5 minutes. Put the wine, water, sugar, and lime juice in a saucepan, put on the heat, and stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a boil and boil for 1 minute before removing the pan from the heat. Wring out the gelatin sheets and place in a cup. Whisk around ½ cup of the hot liquid into the gelatin sheets in their cup before pouring the gelatin and liquid mixture into the pan of hot liquid, whisking well to mix. Allow to cool a little. Pour the liquid over the blackberries in their glasses and refrigerate until set, 3–4 hours depending on how cold your fridge is, or overnight. Serve with some cream in a pitcher, separately.
