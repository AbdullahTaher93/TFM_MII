Put the flour in a mixing bowl and stir in the salt. Cut in the butter or margarine and cream cheese to form a soft dough. Chill if it seems too soft to roll satisfactorily. Roll out very thin. Use only half the dough at a time when making small tarts or appetizer shells, for it is rich and becomes very soft in a warm kitchen. Fit the dough into tart pans or flan rings. Bake in a preheated 375 to 400 degree oven until a very light brown. The baking time will depend on the thickness of the dough. Variation: Cottage Cheese or Pot Cheese Pastry: Use Â¾ cup finely sieved cottage or pot cheese instead of cream cheese. The pastry will not be as rich, but it is very tender and especially good for appetizers filled with hot cheese, crab, shrimp, deviled ham, or chicken livers.
