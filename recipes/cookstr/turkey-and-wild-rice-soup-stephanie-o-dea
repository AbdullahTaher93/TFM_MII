Use a 6-quart slow cooker. This is a 1½-day project. We are going to use the turkey bones to make broth. If you are using chicken broth and 2 cups of turkey, bypass this step. Put the turkey carcass into the slow cooker and cover with 8 cups of water. My carcass was from a tiny turkey, so if you need to break the bones down to fit in your slow cooker, do so. My turkey was still stuffed with a quartered onion and some apple, so I didn’t bother to add any vegetables to season the water. You may certainly add some onion, celery, or anything else you’d like to season the broth with. The more meat and skin left on the bones, the more flavorful the broth. Cover and cook on low overnight, or 8 to 10 hours. Drain the broth into a large pot (do not discard), pick off meat, and add it to the broth. Rinse out your stoneware and put in the chopped vegetables. Return the broth and meat to the stoneware and add the wild rice, sage, bouillon cube, and balsamic vinegar. Stir. Add 2 heaping handfuls of baby spinach to the mix. It will look like a lot, but will wilt down nicely while cooking. Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, or on high for 4 to 6 hours. The soup is done when the vegetables have reached the desired tenderness.
