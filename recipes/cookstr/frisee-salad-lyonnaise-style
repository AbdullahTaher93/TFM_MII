Cook the bacon in a dry skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside. Place the olive oil in a small skillet and turn the heat to medium. Cook the bread cubes, turning occasionally, until crisp and brown on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil, turn the heat to medium-low (the water should be bubbling, but just barely), and add the white vinegar. One by one, crack the eggs and slip them into the water (itâ€™s easier if you break each one into a small bowl or cup first, then use that to transfer the egg into the water). Cook for about 4 minutes, just until the whites are set. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to a cloth towel. To make them look nicer, trim the wisps of egg white with scissors. (The eggs can be poached an hour or two in advance; rewarm in simmering water for a minute before serving. They are not quite as fragile as they look.) Trim, wash, and dry the lettuce. Whisk together the remaining ingredients. (The dressing can be prepared in advance and allowed to sit, covered and refrigerated, overnight. Whisk again before serving.) Dress the lettuce and toss it with the bacon and croutons; season again if necessary. Place a portion of the salad in each of four bowls, top with a poached egg, and serve.
