Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. In a large bowl, stir together the granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt. Add the apples and toss to coat. In a large saute pan, cook the apple mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the apples have released their juices and the juices have begun to thicken. While the apples are cooking, roll out each crust separately between 2 sheets of parchment paper until it is large enough to leave a 1-inch overhang on the pie plate. Remove the parchment paper from one crust and press the crust into the pie plate. Pour the cooked apple mixture into the prepared pie plate. Remove the parchment paper from the second crust and drape the crust over the pie. Crimp the edges of the pie crusts together, then cut several vents in the top crust. Mist the top crust with just a tiny amount of water and sprinkle the top with the superfine sugar. Bake the pie for 40 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the apple mixture is bubbly; if the edges of the pie begin to brown too quickly, cover them with foil for the remainder of the baking time. Let the pie cool completely in the pan on a cooling rack before cutting it. Store the pie, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days. This pie also freezes very well after it has been baked and completely cooled. Just wrap it tightly with plastic wrap, then freeze for up to 3 months. Easily defrost this pie by removing it from the freezer and letting it sit at room temperature for 3 hours.
