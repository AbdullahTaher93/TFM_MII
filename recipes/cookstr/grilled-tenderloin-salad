Combine the soy sauce, black pepper, brown sugar, garlic, vinegar, ginger, lime zest and juice, jalapeño, and crushed red pepper in a mixing bowl. Rub approximately 1/3 cup of the soy-lime mixture over the surface of the beef tenderloin. Wrap the tenderloin in plastic and allow it to marinate for 30 minutes. Prepare the grill. Sear the tenderloin over direct medium heat for 10–15 minutes. Move to indirect medium heat and cook to medium rare (135 degrees), 20–25 minutes. Remove meat from the grill and allow to rest for 20 minutes. Combine all of the vegetables, salt, and cilantro in a mixing bowl and toss with the remaining dressing. Divide the salad onto serving dishes. Slice the beef into ¼-inch-thick slices and arrange the slices on the salad. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and serve immediately.
