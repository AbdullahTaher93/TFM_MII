Put a large pot of water onto boil for the pappardelle. In another — wide — pan, heat the oil gently with the dried chile flakes, and then add the sliced escarole, stirring to help it wilt down in the oil. Add the wine and water and partially cover the pan, letting the escarole cook, bubbling away, for about 6 minutes and let the pasta cook in its pan at the same time. Toss the drained pasta into the cooked escarole (this will be a fairly liquid mixture) and scatter with the parsley and cheese, checking the seasoning as you do so; decorate the top with the fresh red chile if you want enhanced heat and color.
