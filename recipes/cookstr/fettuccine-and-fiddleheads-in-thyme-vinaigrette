In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups (1 L) water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add fiddleheads. Bring back to a boil and cook for 2 minutes or until tender-crisp. Using a slotted spoon, remove to a colander to drain. Discard water. In a large pot of fresh boiling water, cook fettuccine for 6 to 10 minutes or just until tender. Drain. Meanwhile, in a large wok or skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and saut√© for 5 minutes or until soft. Stir in rhubarb. Cook, stirring, for another 5 minutes. Drizzle tamari, sesame oil and maple syrup over onion mixture. Stir in fiddleheads and thyme. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Toss with cooked noodles and serve immediately. Variation: Use 8 oz (250 g) each green and yellow beans, trimmed, instead of the fiddleheads and increase the water to 6 cups (1.5 L).
