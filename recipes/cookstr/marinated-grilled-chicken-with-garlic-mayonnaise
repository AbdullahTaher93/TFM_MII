Gently pound the chicken to flatten it. Mix together the marinade ingredients in a shallow bowl. Add the chicken to the marinade and turn to coat well. Marinate, skin side down, 2 hours, basting occasionally. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place skin side down on a broiler tray. Broil about 7 minutes to each side to brown the chicken, basting occasionally with the marinade. Transfer to a 400Â°F oven and continue cooking and basting skin side up about 15 minutes more. Serve with the Garlic Mayonnaise on the side.
