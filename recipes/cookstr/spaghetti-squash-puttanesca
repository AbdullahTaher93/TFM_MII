Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the spaghetti squash on the sheet and poke about 12 holes in the flesh with a long metal skewer. Bake for 50 minutes. Place a large saucepan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When hot, add the onion and cook for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil, then add the tomato paste. Press the paste against the side of the pan with a spoon before stirring it in to reduce lumps. Stir about 3 tablespoons of hot water around in the can to get the last of the tomato paste, then add to the pot. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. When the squash is done, let it cool enough to touch, then slice it lengthwise and remove the seeds. Use a fork to scrape out the flesh and separate the strands into "pasta:" Transfer to a serving bowl and top with the puttanesca sauce. Drizzle a little olive oil over all before serving.
