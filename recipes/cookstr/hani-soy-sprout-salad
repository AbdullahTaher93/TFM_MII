Wash the soybean sprouts and drain them. Bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the sprouts and soy sauce and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and let the sprouts cook, uncovered, for 1 hour, or until tender. Drain the sprouts in a colander (if you like, drain them over a bowl and save the cooking water for a vegetarian broth), and put them in a shallow bowl or on a plate. Place the dressing ingredients in a cup and use a fork or small whisk to blend them together well. Pour the dressing over the sprouts and toss gently to mix. Add the red chile, scallions, and coriander leaves and gently toss again. Serve warm or at room temperature.
