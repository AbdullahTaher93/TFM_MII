Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant but not brown, 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine and vinegar and bring to a boil, whisking to dissolve the tomato paste. Add the Tabasco sauce and remaining butter and simmer for 2 minutes. I suppose you could make this mop ahead, but why bother? It takes 5 minutes to assemble on the spot.
