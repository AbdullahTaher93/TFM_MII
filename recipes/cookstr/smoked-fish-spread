Cut the smoked fish into 1in (2.5cm) pieces. Place in a food processor and add the cheese, lemon juice, and horseradish. Pulse until smooth. Season with pepper and more horseradish if you wish. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with paprika. Good with melba toast, toasted slices of whole-grain bread, or chunks of baguette. Variation: Smoked Eel Spread: Try making the spread with smoked eel, a traditional Dutch delicacy.
