Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly butter a 9 by 9-inch ovenproof baking dish and set aside. Place the butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips in a bowl and melt in the microwave or over a pot of simmering water. Remove from the microwave and stir to blend and set aside to cool slightly. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Add eggs to the chocolate mixture. Combine the vanilla, coffee liqueur and espresso in a small bowl and stir until the espresso dissolves. Stir this mixture into the chocolate mixture. Add the chocolate mixture to the flour mixture and stir just until all dry ingredients are incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chunks. Spread the batter into the prepare dish and bake 25 to 30 minutes. Cool before slicing into desired size.
