Heat a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Add the butter to the pan, and when it has melted, add the garlic and shallots. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Cook, stirring often, until the shallots are tender, about 4 minutes. Raise the heat to high and add half of the spinach. Season it lightly with salt and pepper. Toss and stir the spinach as it cooks down. When there is enough room in the pan, add the remaining spinach. Continue to cook, stirring often, until the spinach is tender, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the spinach and stir until combined. Continue to cook the spinach until the liquid has thickened, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the yogurt and stir to coat the spinach. Season with salt and pepper to taste, if desired, and serve.
