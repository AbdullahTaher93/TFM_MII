Place the pork, salt, and peppercorns in a large pot. Pour in 10 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 3 hours. Skim the froth off the surface with a spoon. Remove from the heat, take out the pork pieces with a slotted spoon or tongs, and place in a bowl to cool. Strain the broth through a sieve and skim off the fat. Chilling the broth makes removing the fat easier. Once the pork is cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones and tear it into bite-sized pieces. Discard the bones. Measure out enough broth or pork for your chosen recipe and keep the rest refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 6 months.
