Combind the arepa flour, salt, and cheese in a large mixing bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons melted butter and most of the water. Knead the mixture with your hands to obtain a mosit, pliable dough. Add more water as necessary: The dough should be the consistency of mashed potatoes. You may not need all of the water, or you may need a little more. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts. Wet your hands and roll each piece into a ball, then flatten it to make a patty about 3 inches across and 1/3 inch thick. Continue wetting your hands to prevent the dough from sticking. Alternatively, roll out the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap or waxed paper and cut out 3-inch circles, using a cookie cutter. Heat some of the remaining melted butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Fry the arepas until crusty and golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Working in batches, as necessary, to avoid crowding the pan. Add more butter or oil if needed. Serve at once. 3.
