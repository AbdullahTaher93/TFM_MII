In a small saucepan, add the cold water and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Let stand for 5 minutes. Add the Lyleâ€™s Golden Syrup and heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 4 to 5 minutes, or just until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Pour the gelatin and syrup mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer and beat for 3 minutes on medium speed, and then for 12 minutes at medium-high speed. The mixture will become thick, fluffy, and very sticky, just like commercial marshmallow cream. Stir in the confectioners sugar, vanilla, and salt until combined, then beat on medium-high for another 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat for another minute. The longer it sits at room temperature, the stickier (more like a marshmallow) it will become. Store, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days. Or store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months. To defrost the cream, just place it in the refrigerator for several hours, and then let it sit at room temperature for another hour.
