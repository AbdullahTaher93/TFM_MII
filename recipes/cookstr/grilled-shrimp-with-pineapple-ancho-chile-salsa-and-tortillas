Peel and devein the shrimp and remove their tails. Thread the shrimp on skewers, salt and pepper them to taste, and grill over medium heat, 3 to 4 minutes per side, until they are opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and chop each shrimp into 3 or 4 pieces. Set aside. Make the salsa: Dice the pineapple, red pepper, and red onion. Add the pureed ancho chile peppers, and mix together in a medium bowl with the oregano, cumin, and lime and pineapple juices. Warm the tortillas slightly on the grill. Put the shrimp, salsa, and tortillas out on a table, along with the shredded cabbage, sour cream, and jalape√±os as garnishes, and let people make their own rolled tortillas.
