Measure the sugar and water into a small saucepan and stir together over low heat to dissolve the sugar. Whisk the egg white in a bowl until light and fluffy. Cut the apples into chunks, removing the cores and pushing the apple chunks through a juice extractor as you go. Quickly whisk together the apple puree, sugar syrup, egg white, and lemon juice. Itâ€™s okay if the egg white rises to the top; it will be incorporated as the sherbet is frozen. Freeze following the instructions for your ice cream maker.
