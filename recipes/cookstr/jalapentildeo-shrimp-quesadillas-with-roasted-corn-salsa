Roast the ears of corn under a hot broiler or on a hot charcoal grill until the kernels are slightly browned. This should take about 5 minutes, but check frequently to make sure the corn isn’t burning. After the ears are cool enough to handle, remove the browned kernels by running a knife lengthwise down the cob. In a small bowl, mix together the corn and remaining ingredients. Toss well, cover and chill. Prepare the onions and bell peppers by cutting them into strips about 1 inch in length. Carefully remove the seeds from the jalapeños and dice them. (Make sure not to touch your face, and wash your hands immediately after handling these peppers.) To cook the quesadilla filling, heat the canola oil in a large sauté pan. Add the onion and all the peppers and sauté until the peppers are soft. Add the shrimp and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, until pink. Spread ½ cup or more of the quesadilla filling on a tortilla, cover with shredded cheese and top with another tortilla. Continue assembling quesadillas until you have used all the filling and cheese. Place in a large non-stick skillet and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cover. Continue cooking for about another 4 minutes. If you prefer, you can bake these on a non-stick cookie sheet for about 6 to 8 minutes in a 450°F oven. Baked quesadillas will be less moist than fried ones. Serve, cut in wedges, with Roasted Corn Salsa.
