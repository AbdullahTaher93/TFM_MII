Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a bowl, mix the honey, spices, oil, and extracts. Stir in the oats and nuts. Mix well and spread over a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Stir and continue to bake for another 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool completely and break apart. Store in an airtight container away from heat. You may substitute the honey with agave nectar. Enjoy with low-fat soy milk, low-fat rice milk, low-fat almond milk, low-fat milk, low-fat plain yogurt, or a mix of low-fat milk and low-fat plain yogurt. Top with your favorite fruits for added nutritional values. Add 1 teaspoon freshly ground flaxseeds per serving before serving.
