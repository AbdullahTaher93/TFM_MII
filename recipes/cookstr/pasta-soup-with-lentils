Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Stir in the pancetta or bacon, onion, carrot, and celery for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are soft. Add the water, passata, rosemary, and chile flakes. Bring to the boil and simmer for about 10 minutes. Add the pasta and cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes or until the pasta is al dente. Stir the drained lentils into the soup. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until warmed through, season to taste with salt. Top with the pecorino cheese and a drizzle of olive oil and serve.
