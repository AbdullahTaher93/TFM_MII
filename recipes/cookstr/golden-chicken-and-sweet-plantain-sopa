Make the Annatto Oil: Place the annatto seeds in a dry skillet and toast over medium heat for 30 seconds. Gradually add the olive oil and slowly cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to steep about for 30 minutes. Strain and discard the seeds. Pour the oil into a bottle or jar and store tightly closed in a cool place out of the sunlight. Makes 2 Cups Heat a small skillet. When a drop of water sizzles on the bottom of the pan, add the cumin and pepper and toast about 1 minute. Let cool and combine with salt to taste. Sprinkle the mixture on both sides of the chicken. Place the chicken on a plate and drizzle with the annatto oil, turning the chicken several times to coat. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour, to allow the oil to deeply color the chicken. Meanwhile, sprinkle the plantain slices with a pinch of salt, sugar, and cayenne. Place a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the olive oil and butter. Sauté the plantains until golden on both sides. Add the leeks, onion, celery, carrots, garlic, and chiles. Stir, and cook until the vegetables are soft and lightly browned. If necessary, add a small amount of oil to the pan. Add the saffron, cilantro, and orange juice. Stir in the chicken broth. Lower the heat and simmer 10 to 12 minutes, stirring often. Pour the soup in small batches into a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Return to the pot, add the half-and-half or cream, and adjust seasoning. Set aside. Place the chicken in a nonstick skillet and sauté over medium heat about 3 minutes per side, or until just cooked through. Remove, cool slightly, and cut into bite-size pieces. Gently reheat the soup until it’s warm but not boiling and ladle into warm bowls. Garnish with the chicken and serve.
