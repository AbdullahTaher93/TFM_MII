Heat the oil in a medium skillet and add the lemon juice, thyme, basil, oregano, pepper, red pepper flakes, and salt. Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat. Dip the fish fillets, one at a time, in the oil mixture, coating both sides heavily with herbs. Place the fillets on a flat tray and freeze until very cold, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat. Arrange as many fillets as will fit in a single layer in the skillet and quickly sear and blacken both sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer the fillets to a serving platter and refrigerate for several hours. Repeat with any remaining fillets. Serve cold or at room temperature, sprinkled with the basil and garnished with the lemon wedges.
