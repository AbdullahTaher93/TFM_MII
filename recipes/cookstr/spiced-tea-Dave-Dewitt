Put 2 cups of water and the spices in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover the pot, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the milk and sugar and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the tea leaves, cover the pot, and turn off the heat. Allow the tea to steep for 2 minutes. Strain the chai into a teapot or individual cups and serve immediately.
