To marinate the chicken: Place the yogurt, tomatoes, cilantro, ginger, garlic, and green chilies in a blender and puree. Place the chicken in a bowl and toss with the marinade to coat. Set aside for at least 2 hours. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften and turn a golden shade of brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and cloves. Add the chicken with marinade and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 7 minutes, until the mixture is somewhat dry. Stir in the orzo and broth and bring to a simmer and cook for about 6 minutes. Stir in the saffron and turn off the heat. Cover and let this rest for 20 minutes (by now the mixture should be soft and pale brown). For the finish: Heat the oil and stir in the almonds and pine nuts and cook until pale golden. Stir in the mint. Add to the pilaf and serve immediately.
