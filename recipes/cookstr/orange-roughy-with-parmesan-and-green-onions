Arrange your oven rack to be 4 inches from the broiler. Preheat the broiler. Place fillets in a buttered 9 x 13-inch glass baking dish; brush the fish with the lemon juice and let sit 10 minutes. Broil the fish until it is predominantly white and flaky and no longer opaque. Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl. Spread the mixture evenly over the fillets. Broil 2 to 3 minutes longer until topping is golden. Variations: Fresh herbs (oregano, basil and thyme) may be added into the mixture for another variation of this recipe. Tilapia and other similar textured white fish may be substituted in place of roughy.
