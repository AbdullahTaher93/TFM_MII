Bring 2 2/3 cups lightly salted water to a boil in a covered mediumsize saucepan. Add the rice, stir, and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oil in an extra-deep 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Peel the carrots and, holding the knife at a 45-degree angle, cut them into ½-inch-thick slices. Add the carrots to the skillet, stirring occasionally. Peel the onion, cut it in half, and then cut the onion halves into ¼-inch-thick crescent-shaped slices. Add the onions to the skillet. Cut the broccoli florets from the stalks. (Discard the stalks.) Cut the florets into bite-size pieces, if necessary. Add the broccoli to the skillet and continue to cook while you rinse, pat dry, and slice the mushrooms, removing and discarding any tough stems. Add the mushrooms to the skillet as you slice. Drain the water chestnuts (if using) and set aside. Raise the heat to high and cook, stirring, until the broccoli and carrots are crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes more. Add the water chestnuts and Stir-Fry Sauce. Stir to mix well and cook until the sauce is slightly thick, about 1 minute. Serve at once over the hot rice.
