In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil, paprika, and cumin over low heat, stirring, until the spices are aromatic, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in the scallion whites. Cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in the lentils, stock, and garlic. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are almost done. Stir in the scallion greens, chard, cilantro, and lemon juice. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until the chard is cooked through and the lentils are soft. Season with salt, if necessary, and pepper.
