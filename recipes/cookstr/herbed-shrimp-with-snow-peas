Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the salt, and squeeze the lime into the water. Add the shrimp, cover the pot, and remove from the heat. Let the pan sit for about 3 minutes. Remove the shrimp from the water with a slotted spoon and immerse them in an ice bath to stop the cooking. Peel the shrimp, removing the tail. In a large bowl, combine the lemon zest and juice. ½ teaspoon of the salt, garlic, dill, and mustard. Stir to combine, and let the mixture sit for 3 minutes to give the salt a chance to dissolve. Whisk in the olive oil and black pepper. Add the shrimp to the marinade and toss to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours. Bring a pot with 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the remaining ½ teaspoon salt to the water, along with the snow peas. Cook for 3 minutes. Remove the snow peas from the hot water with a slotted spoon and immerse them in an ice bath to stop the cooking. Remove from the ice bath and lay them out on a towel to dry. Wrap a snow pea around the circumference of each shrimp. Secure it in place with a toothpick. Arrange the shrimp on a decorative platter and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
