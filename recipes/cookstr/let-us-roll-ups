Preparation: Put the sauce ingredients in a small bowl, stir to combine, and break up any lumps with a fork; set aside. Heat a large sauté pan or wok on medium-high heat. Cook the meat, untouched, until it looks like it is cooking underneath and juices start to be released. Add the carrot and broccoli. Start breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. Continue stirring and breaking up the lumps until the meat is thoroughly cooked. If the meat is giving off a lot of grease, drain it before adding the sauce. Turn the heat down to medium-low, give the sauce a stir, and add it to the pan. Mix well and cook for 2 minutes more, until the meat is coated and glossy, continuing to break up any large chunks of meat. Serve the meat and lettuce leaves separately on a plate, and have your child try to put the meat in the leaves with a spoon, then sprinkle with nuts and eat like a taco. Variations Mix ¼ cup cooked rice into the meat mixture to change it up. Add minced onion or garlic when you add the vegetables. This will get your kids used to new flavors without them seeing the identifiable chunks. Then the next time you cook this recipe, make the onions larger.
