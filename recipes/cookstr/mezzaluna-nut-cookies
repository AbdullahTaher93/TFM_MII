Process the nuts, flour, and salt in a food processor fitted with a steel blade until the nuts are finely ground. Set aside. Cream the butter and confectioners’ sugar in a mixer bowl. Beat in the vanilla and almond extracts. Stir in the nut mixture thoroughly. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Break off 1-inch pieces of the dough and shape by hand into 1½-inch crescents. Place on the prepared cookie sheets. Bake the cookies until very lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool a few minutes and then toss in a shallow bowl of granulated sugar to coat evenly. Store the cookies in an airtight container.
