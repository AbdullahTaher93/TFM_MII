Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet (or a small cast-iron pan) until they are ¼ inch thick. Season the chicken very lightly with salt and pepper (not too much, since the capers in the sauce add salt). On a plate, combine the Parmesan and flour; dredge the chicken pieces in the cheese mixture and shake off the excess. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter; add the olive oil. Cook the chicken breasts for 3 minutes per side, or until juices run clear when the tip of a knife is inserted into the center. Remove the chicken from the pan and keep warm. Add the mushrooms and leeks to the skillet and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic, lemon juice, chicken stock, wine, capers, and parsley. Reduce the liquid in the pan by about two thirds, until the sauce is thickened and syrupy. Add the remaining butter to the sauce, and stir until combined. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve.
