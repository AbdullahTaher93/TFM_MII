Place a wok over high heat. When it is hot, add the lard or oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the wok, then toss in the ginger and chiles. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds, to a well-blended bright red mass, then add the pork slices and stir-fry until they have all changed color, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss in the cabbage and stir-fry for about a minute. Add the salt and stir, then cover and cook for about 1 minute. Remove the lid and stir-fry a little longer, just until the cabbage is softened but not limp. Toss in the scallion ribbons and stir-fry for another 30 seconds or so. Turn out into a wide shallow bowl and serve.
