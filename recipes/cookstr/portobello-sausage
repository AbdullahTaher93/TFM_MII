In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, nama shoyu, plum paste, and apple cider vinegar. Toss in mushrooms and eggplant, and allow to marinate 15-20 minutes. Process almonds, pumpkin seeds, and coriander in food processor into small pieces; do not overprocess. Place mixture in large bowl. Process marinated mushrooms and eggplant with scallions, garlic, and parsley in food processor until chunky; add to bowl with almonds and pumpkin seeds. Stir mixture until ingredients are well combined and season with salt and pepper. Shape mixture in patties or balls and place on dehydrator screens. Dehydrate (see Notes) 8-12 hours, until crust forms on outside.
