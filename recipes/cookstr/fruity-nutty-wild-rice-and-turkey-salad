Combine the rice, Â¼ cups of water and the salt in a heavy 2-quart Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and reduce the heat so that the water simmers. Cook for 5 minutes. Stir well. Turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes. While the rice is cooking, combine the turkey, oranges, apple, cranberries, and hazelnuts in a serving bowl. In a small bowl, blend the mayonnaise and orange juice. When the rice is done, drain off any unabsorbed liquid and toss it into the salad. Stir in the dressing and add salt to taste, if needed.
