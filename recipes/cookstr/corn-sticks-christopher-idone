Generously great the corn stick mold with bacon fat and place in the oven for 5 minutes, or until smoking. Removed the mold from the oven and spoon batter into each mold until one-third full. Return the mold to the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden. Remove the cornsticks, regrease the mold with bacon fat and repeat until all of the batter is used.
