Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until nicely browned, watching closely so they don't burn. Let cool, and crush lightly with your hands. To make the dressing, whisk the vinegar, mustard, and sugar in a bowl. Gradually whisk in the oil. Season with salt and pepper. Combine the watercress, shallots, and walnuts in a large bowl. Toss with the dressing, and serve immediately. 2. To make the dressing, whisk the vinegar, mustard, and sugar in a bowl.
