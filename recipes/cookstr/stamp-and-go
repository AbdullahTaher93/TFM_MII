Cover the salt fish with cold water, and let the fish soak 4 to 12 hours. Drain the fish, then place it in a saucepan, and cover it with fresh cold water. Bring the water to a boil, and simmer the fish 15 minutes or until tender. Let it cool in the cooking water. Combine the ingredients for the key lime sauce, and chill the sauce until you're ready to serve it. Skin and flake the fish. Mix the flaked fish, green onions, peppers, and tomatoes in a bowl. Stir in the flour and baking powder, and add enough water to make a soft, sticky batter. Heat the oil to between 350° and 375°. Drop the batter by the teaspoonful into the oil. Fry the fritters, a few at a time, until they are golden brown. Drain them on paper towels, and serve them immediately with the key lime sauce for dipping.
