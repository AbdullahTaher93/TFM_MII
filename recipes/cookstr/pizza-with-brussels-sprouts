Place a baking stone in the oven, and preheat to 500°F (260°C) or higher for 1 hour. Bring 1 quart water with sea salt to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan. While the water is heating, rinse the Brussels sprouts in cold water, and remove any wilted leaves. Place the Brussels sprouts in the boiling water, and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the Brussels sprouts with a slotted spoon, and place them in a bowl of ice water for a few minutes to cool. Pour off the water. Stretch the pizza dough to a diameter of 12 inches (30 cm). Distribute the mozzarella, ricotta, and Pecorino Romano over the pizza. Distribute the pancetta and garlic over the pizza. Peel the leaves from the Brussels sprouts, and place them on the pizza. Bake the pizza on the baking stone until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling. Remove the pizza from the oven, and place it on a plate. Top with coarsely ground black pepper and a bit of olive oil, and serve.
