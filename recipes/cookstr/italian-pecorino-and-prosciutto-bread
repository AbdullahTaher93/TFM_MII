Stir the yeast into the milk in a large mixing bowl and let stand until dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes. Beat in the eggs, olive oil, and butter until well blended. Combine 3½ cups flour with the salt and pepper, add it to the yeast mixture, and stir to form a dough. Work in the cheeses and the prosciutto. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead, adding more flour if the dough is too sticky, until smooth and satiny, 7 to 10 minutes. Shape the dough into 1 round and bulbous loaf. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 1½ to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400° F. Bake the bread until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack.
