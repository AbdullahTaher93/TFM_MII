In a blender or food processor, combine two-thirds of the Stilton, and all of the honey, the garlic, the sour cream, and the vinegar. Blend until the mixture is smooth. With the machine running, slowly add the half and half. Transfer the dressing to a bowl, and add salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate the dressing until you are ready to use it. When you are ready to serve the salad, put the half rings of endive into a bowl, add the watercress, and toss. Place a large handful of the greens onto each of four large salad plates. Lay the pear slices over the salad, and drizzle about 3 tablespoons dressing over each plate. Crumble the remaining Stilton, and garnish the salad with the cheese, the walnuts or pecans, and, if you like, the red onion. Serve immediately.
