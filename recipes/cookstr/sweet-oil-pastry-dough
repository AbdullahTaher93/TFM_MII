In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar and salt. Add oil and 4 tbsp (60 mL) orange juice, stirring with a fork until flour is evenly moistened. If mixture is still too dry to work with your hands, add 1 to 2 tbsp (15 to 25 mL) more orange juice until moist clumps form. Divide dough in half. With your hands, press half of the dough evenly on the bottom and up the side of each pie plate. With the tines of a fork, score the edge of pastry. Fill and bake according to recipe directions (see Notes).
