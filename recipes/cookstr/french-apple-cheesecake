Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) Crust: In a bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs and butter. Press into bottom of cheesecake pan and freeze. Filling: In a mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment, beat cream cheese, sour cream, brown sugar and honey on medium-high speed until very smooth, for 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Mix in vanilla and lemon juice. Stir in cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Pour over frozen crust, smoothing out to sides of pan. Topping: In a bowl, using a pastry fork or two knives, cut butter into flour as if making a pie crust. Add brown sugar, cinnamon and cloves. Add apple slices and toss to coat. Arrange slices in a spiral over batter. Bake in preheated oven until apples are light brown and slightly firm in the center, 60 to 75 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours before decorating or serving. Decoration: In a small bowl, whisk confectioner’s sugar with butter and hot water. Drizzle over chilled cake. Variation Use the topping in the filling of the cheesecake instead of arranging it on top. Just blend it into the batter and bake as directed.
