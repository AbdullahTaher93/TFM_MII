Cut each eggplant in half lengthwise, then cut diagonally into Â½-inch slices. Cover the eggplants with water, add the salt, and stir to dissolve the salt. Soak the eggplants for 5 minutes, then drain well. In a small bowl, mix the oyster sauce with the sugar and sesame oil and set aside. Heat a wok or nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the vegetable oil, garlic, chili peppers, and eggplants and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water and continue stir-frying for 2 more minutes. Add the oyster sauce mixture and stir well to mix. Remove to a platter and serve hot or cold.
