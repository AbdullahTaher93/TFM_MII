In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, garam masala, cardamom, cinnamon stick, chili powder, ginger, and salt. Add the chicken, turning to coat. Let marinate for as long as you have time—if more than an hour, place the bowl in the refrigerator. Using a rubber spatula, scrape off as much of the yogurt marinade from the chicken as possible; reserve the marinade. Pat the chicken dry using paper towels, and sprinkle with the turmeric. Heat a tablespoon or so of oil in a wide pot over high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the skin is nicely browned. You may have to do this in two batches in order not to crowd the pot. 4 Remove the chicken, reduce the heat and sauté the onions and garlic for 4 to 5 minutes, until starting to soften. Add the chicken, the reserved marinade, the cashews, and tomato paste, cover, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. 5 Stir in the cream (if desired) and cook for 2 more minutes, garnish with cilantro. Variation: If you would like to make a thick sauce without adding a lot of calories, add another ½ cup of yogurt along with the marinade and chicken.
