Parboil the potatoes in salted boiling water for 8 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Transfer the potatoes to a heavy heatproof casserole. Add the broth, sour cream, and salt and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, uncovering to stir occasionally, until the potatoes are very tender. Five minutes before the potatoes are finished cooking, stir in the garlic. Toss with the dill and serve.
