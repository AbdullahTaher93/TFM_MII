Sprinkle the salt over the garlic on a chopping board and finely mince the garlic. Combine this with the vinegar and the mustard in a small bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Continue whisking until the vinaigrette thickens. Season with pepper. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.
