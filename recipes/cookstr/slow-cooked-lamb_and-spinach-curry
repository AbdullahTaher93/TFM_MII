Put the oil in a heavy-bottomed, lidded casserole dish on a medium heat. When it's hot, add the onions and fry for 10 to 12 minutes, until soft, golden, and starting to brown. Add the ginger and the garlic and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, stirring. Add the chili, cumin, and coriander, and follow with the diced lamb. When the lamb pieces have colored all over, add the plum tomatoes, pouring them into the pan with one hand and breaking them up with the other, then the tomato paste and the salt. Stir well. Fill the tomato can with half as much water (3/4 cup) and add that to the dish. Give it a final stir and bring the mixture to a boil, then cover with the lid and turn the heat down low. Simmer for around 1 1/4 hours, or until the meat is soft and tender. When you're happy with the tenderness of the meat, add the spinach to the pot in batches and cook until just wilted. Leave the lid off to reduce the sauce to your desired consistency, then take off the heat. This is especially good with a steaming bowl of caramelized onions and jeera rice.
