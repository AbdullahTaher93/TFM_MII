Combine the water, oil, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in ½ cup of the flour and the yeast. Add the remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, to make a soft dough. Knead on a lightly floured work surface for 5 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth. Shape into a ball. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand about 1 hour in a warm place until doubled in volume. Briefly knead the dough until smooth. Cut the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each into a thin oval shape, about 8in (20cm) long. Brush 2 large baking sheets with oil. Place 4 ovals onto each sheet. Cover with oiled plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for about 20 minutes until the dough has risen slightly. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Brush the tops of the ovals lightly with oil. Bake for about 10 minutes, until puffed and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm. Variation: Spiced Pitas: Before baking, sprinkle with lightly crushed coriander, cumin, or fennel seeds for a fragrant version, or add 2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds to the dough during the second kneading.
