Place the fowl and chicken or turkey parts in a large stockpot. Add 5 quarts cold water and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Adjust the heat so that the water is barely simmering. Skim off the foam and fat that rises to the surface of the broth. Once the foam stops rising, add the remaining ingredients. Cook 2 hours, regulating the heat so that the liquid bubbles gently. Let the broth cool briefly, then strain it into plastic storage containers. The broth can be used right away, or let it cool completely, then cover and store it in the refrigerator up to 3 days or in the freezer up to 3 months.
