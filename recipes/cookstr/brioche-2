Stir the warm milk and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes. Using an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, mix the flour, eggs, sugar, and fleur de sel in a large bowl to blend well; add the yeast mixture. Beat on medium speed until the dough is elastic, about 2 minutes (the dough will be sticky). With the machine running, gradually add the butter; beat until well blended. Cover the dough and refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours (this will make the dough easier to work with). Preheat the oven to 150°F. Lightly oil a 9¼ × 5 × 2¾-inch loaf pan. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 5 × 2 × 2-inch oval-shaped ball. Place the balls side by side in the prepared pan. Bake until the dough rises slightly, about 20 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 375°F and continue baking the brioche until it is dark brown on the outside and an instant-read thermometer registers 200°F when inserted into the center of the loaf, about 1 hour longer. Cool the brioche in the pan for 5 minutes. Turn the bread out and cool completely on a rack.
