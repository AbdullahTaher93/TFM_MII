In a 2-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the cream to a light simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, measure the chocolate and place it in a medium-sized, heat-resistant mixing bowl. Once the cream reaches a light simmer, pour it over the chocolate. Wait about 10 seconds for the cream to work its way into all of the crevices between the pieces of chocolate, then whisk to combine. Let the ganache cool for 5 to 10 minutes before using.
