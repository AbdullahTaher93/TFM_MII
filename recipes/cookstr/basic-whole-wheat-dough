Food processor method In a food processor with metal blade, combine flour and salt. Process for 5 seconds. Drizzle in oil. With machine running, pour in Â¾ cup (175 mL) lukewarm water in a thin steady stream for 30 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl. Gradually drizzle in more of the water in 3 or 4 additions, stopping every 20 seconds to check consistency of dough. Add just enough water until dough sticks together when pinched between thumb and forefinger. Process until dough forms a ball. Knead for 1 minute longer and turn off motor. The dough should be smooth and soft. Transfer dough to work surface and pat until perfectly smooth. Place in a bowl, cover with a damp cloth and let rest in a warm place for at least 30 minutes. (The dough can be made a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Let come to room temperature before using.) Hand method Sift flour and salt onto a large flat pizza pan. Drizzle oil on top and mix in with fingertips. Make a well in the center and add lukewarm water a little at a time while mixing the flour from the sides into the center. Use a circular motion with your fingers to incorporate all the flour. When you have added enough water to form a crumbly mixture, work it into a smooth dough. Add more water if necessary, a little at a time, kneading until dough is soft and smooth. Place in a bowl, cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes. (The dough can be made a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Let come to room temperature before using.)
