Combine the flour, nuts, and sugar in a mixing bowl. Using a fork, cut in the butter to just blend. Stir in the egg yolks, mixing with the fork just until the dough comes together. If necessary, add ice water, a few drops at a time. Form the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic film. Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until thoroughly chilled. When ready to roll out, lightly flour a clean, flat work surface. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly butter six 4-inch round fluted tart pans with a removable bottom. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Place it on the lightly floured surface and, using a rolling pin, roll out to a circle about 1/8 inch thick. Using a plain or fluted 5-inch round cutter, cut 6 dough circles. Working with one at a time, fit a pastry round into each tart shell, pressing it into the bottom and sides. Work carefully, as the dough is a bit fragile. If it breaks, just push it together with your fingertips. Even the edge of the pastry with the rim of the pan. Place the tart shells on a baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and place on wire racks to cool until ready to fill.
