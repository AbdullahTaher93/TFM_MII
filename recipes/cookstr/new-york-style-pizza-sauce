In a medium bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, including the juice from the can, the tomato paste, olive oil, basil, oregano, sugar, garlic, and salt. Taste and add more salt, if desired. Use immediately, or store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before using. COOKâ€™S NOTE One brand of chopped tomatoes that is a favorite of ours is Pomi tomatoes, made in Italy by Parmalat. This brand of tomatoes comes in a 26.5-ounce box, which keeps the tomatoes very fresh tasting and prevents them from picking up a canned flavor. Look for them in well-stocked supermarkets or in specialty stores carrying Italian foodstuffs
