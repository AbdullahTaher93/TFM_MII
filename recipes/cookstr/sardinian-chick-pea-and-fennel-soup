Rinse the chick-peas in cold water and drain. In a soup kettle over low heat, warm the oil. Add the onion, garlic, and the 2 tablespoons parsley; cover and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly colored, about 5 minutes. Remove the cover and add the fennel bulb and fronds and potato and sauté for an additional 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, salt, and pepper, and then the chick-peas and boiling water. Stir well, cover, and cook for 10 minutes over medium heat. Add the pasta and salt and continue to simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is just tender, about 10 minutes longer. Taste and correct for salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Stir in the 1 teaspoon parsley and the ¼ cup cheese. Ladle the soup into individual bowls and serve. Pass additional cheese at the table. VARIATION WITH ROSEMARY: To the tomatoes in the skillet, add 1 heaping tablespoon of tomato paste, then the salt and pepper. In a blender or with a potato masher, crush half of the chickpeas. Add them and the remaining whole chickpeas to the skillet with 7 cups of boiling stock or water. Stir in 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves, or 1 teaspoon dried rosemary. Proceed as directed in the recipe.
