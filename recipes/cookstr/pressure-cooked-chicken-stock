Wash all the chicken parts under cold water. Place in a 6- to 8-quart pressure cooker with 8 cups of water. Slowly bring to almost boiling, skimming off the scum as it rises to the surface. When water is clear and free of scum, add the remaining ingredients. Seal the cooker. Place the pressure regulator firmly on the vent pipe. When pressure regulator begins to gently rock, start timing. Cook for 30 minutes with pressure regulator, rocking- slowly and continuously, or follow the manufacturer’s directions for your cooker. Allow pressure to drop gradually with the lid in place until all the steam has left the cooker. Do not place the cooker under cold running water to reduce the pressure. Follow the manufacturer’s directions for, cooling. Cool the stock to room temperature, then strain through several layers of cheesecloth. Discard the vegetables, but reserve the chicken parts and gizzards for another use. Refrigerate the stock overnight for easy removal of excess fat.
