Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat; do not brown. Remove from the heat and let stand until the solids settle to the bottom of the pan. Skim the foam from the top and spoon the clear liquid (the clarified butter) into a measuring cup; there should be ½ cup. Discard the solids on the bottom of the pan. Heat 8 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the rice, salt, cinnamon stick, cloves, peppercorns, and cardamom; cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is almost tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain immediately; let stand in the sieve until ready to use. (Leave the spices and peppercorns in the rice.) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Add 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter to a 10-inch heavy ovenproof skillet or wide saucepan, preferably nonstick. Add the onions; cook, stirring, until golden. Add the saffron threads; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Spread the onions evenly over the bottom of the pan. Spoon the rice on top. Drizzle with the remaining clarified butter; smooth the top and press down with a spatula. Cover with a double thickness of foil, pressing down on the foil to compact the rice. Bake until the bottom is crisp and golden, 55 to 60 minutes. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Uncover the pan, place a large platter over it, and carefully invert the rice onto the platter.
