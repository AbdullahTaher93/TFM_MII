Make the panache. In a small mixing bowl, cover the green peppercorns with the boiling water and allow them to soften. Cut the papaya in half lengthwise, scoop out and discard the seeds, then peel the halves and cut them across into strips about 1/8 inch thick. Stir the lime zest, lime juice, sugar, and salt into the softened green peppercorns and their soaking liquid, then add the sliced papaya and sliced red onion and toss to coat. In a backyard barbecue, build a fire with wood or charcoal, and burn until the flames settle into white-hot coals, or preheat a gas grill. Sprinkle the tuna steaks with salt and pepper. Put the olive oil on a plate and, just before grilling, dip the seasoned steaks in the oil to lightly coat each side. Grill the fish, turning it once, as soon as it is cooked about Â¼ inch inward, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve the panache at room temperature over the hot grilled fish.
