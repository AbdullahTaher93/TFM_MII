Chop the onion. Rinse, trim, and thinly slice the mushrooms (if using shiitakes, discard the stems). Cut the turkey into ½-inch cubes. Stem the mint and coarsely chop the leaves. Heat the oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté, stirring frequently, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, cover the pan, and simmer over low heat, stirring every now and then, until the mushrooms are tender, about 3 minutes more. Add the turkey and simmer covered until just cooked or heated through, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the fresh mint, remove the pan from the heat, and let stand covered until the mint is barely wilted, about 1 minute. Give the stew a stir and season to taste with salt and pepper. Turkey Ragout: 1 can (16 ounces) white beans and 1 can (13¾ ounces) chicken broth mixed with the leftovers of this stew would make a very fine soup indeed.
