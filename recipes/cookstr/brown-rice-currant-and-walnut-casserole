Preheat the oven to 375°F. Mince the garlic. Halve or quarter the dried apricots, depending on how large they are or how big you would like the pieces to be. Heat the olive oil in a medium-size heatproof casserole over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for a few seconds until you can smell its aroma. Stir in the rice and spices, then the apricots and currants. Add the broth and bring the liquid to a boil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and bake for 35 minutes (or 20 minutes if you’re using white rice or cracked wheat). Meanwhile cut the ham into ½-inch cubes and coarsely chop the nuts. Mince the mint if using. Remove the pan from the oven and stir in the ham. Cover and bake until the rice is tender, 15 minutes or more. Just before serving, stir in the nuts and mint. Adjust the seasoning and serve hot with sour cream or yogurt on the side, if you desire. Variations: Vegetarians can substitute 2 cans chick-peas, drained, or 4 firm bean curd cakes, chopped, for the ham.
