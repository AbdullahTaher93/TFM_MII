Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and position rack near the center. Place the chicken in a 6-cup oval ceramic baking dish or a 9-by-13-inch baking pan, then sprinkle it inside and out with the salt, dried herbs, and pepper. If you like, place a few sprigs of each herb inside the cavity of the chicken. Roast for 90 minutes, basting from time to time if desired. Transfer the chicken to a carving board or a platter. Set it in a warm place and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Tilt the roasting pan over a cup to collect pan drippings, and set aside. (Fat will rise to the surface and flavorful juices will sink to the bottom.) Pour 1 cup of the chicken broth into the roasting pan. With a metal spatula, scrape up any bits clinging to the pan. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, whisk the cornstarch into the remaining cup of chicken broth and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to boil. Add the broth from the roasting pan and continue stirring until boiling and slightly thickened. Discard most of the fat from the top of the reserved pan drippings (you should have about 1 cups), then whisk the juices into the gravy. Transfer to a gravy boat. Serve the chicken hot with garlic mashed potatoes, a simple green vegetable, and the gravy.
