Make the black beans. Stir the chicken broth, sofrito, tomato sauce, alcaparrado, salt, pepper, and chili pepper into the black beans. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Continue boiling until the soup is nice and thick and has just enough liquid to cover the beans. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes so the beans soak up a little more of the liquid. Serve hot, ladled into warm bowls, and pass the toppings you have prepared.
