To Make the Brine: Combine all the ingredients and stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. Add whatever you are going to brine and refrigerate for 24 hours, or up to 1 week, depending on what you are preparing. To Cook the Pork Roast: Lift the pork roast out of the brine and rinse it. Spread the fennel fronds on the bottom of the pressure cooker. Set the roast on top. Spread the fennel slices and figs over the roast. Pour in the water and wine, lock on the lid, and bring to pressure over high heat about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium to medium-high and cook for 45 minutes, adjusting the level so the pressure doesn’t build up too high. Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes to finish cooking. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure. Let the roast rest for 10 minutes with the lid ajar. Remove the roast slice it ½ inch thick, and arrange the slices on a serving platter. Top with the fennel and figs from the pot. Remove and discard the fennel fronds, then spoon the juices over the roast and vegetables. Serve right away.
