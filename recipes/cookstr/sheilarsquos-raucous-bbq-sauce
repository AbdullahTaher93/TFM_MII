Combine all the ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Add 1 cup water, stir well, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly and the flavors have blended, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, discarding the onion and garlic. Taste, and adjust the seasonings as needed. Use immediately, or let the sauce cool to room temperature, transfer it to a covered container, and refrigerate it for up to 1 week.
