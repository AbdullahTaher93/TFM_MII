Combine the water and sugar in a medium-size saucepan. Bring to a bubbling simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, for 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally (the liquid will thicken slightly). Remove from the heat. Immediately stir in the rose water and lemon juice. Let cool slightly, then pour into a glass jar. Refrigerate for at least 5 to 6 hours or overnight until completely chilled. Serve very cold in a pitcher or drizzled over various desserts. This syrup will remain fresh in a jar in the refrigerator for months. A’TER M’ZAHER (Orange Blossom Water Syrup): Simply substitute orange blossom water for the rose water.
