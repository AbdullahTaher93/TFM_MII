Cut the steaks-along the grain, not against it-into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. Put the meat into a saucepan with the onion, cilantro, garlic, and salt, barely cover with water, and simmer until tender-about 25 minutes for skirt steak and 35 for flank. Allow the meat to cool off in the broth. Strain, reserving the broth. When the meat is cool enough to handle, remove any gristle or sinew and shred roughly. Set aside. In a heavy frying pan, heat the lard, add the onion and garlic, and fry gently without browning until translucent-about 3 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and continue cooking over high heat, stirring and turning it over from time to time to prevent sticking, until the mixture has reduced and thickened about 8 minutes. Add the shredded meat, chiles, cilantro, and broth, taste for salt, and cook over medium heat, covered, for about 5 minutes longer.
