The Process Heat oven or toaster oven to 375 degrees. Mix bread crumbs, garlic, yeast, extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper in a bowl (add Parmesan if using). Place chicken between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a kitchen mallet or heavy pan until Â¼ inch thick. Cut chicken into two-inch strips (if the chicken is thick, pound it out a bit more). Coat chicken with the breadcrumb mixture and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Cook for 10 minutes. Serve with creamy dill dipping sauce or sweet and spicy mustard.
