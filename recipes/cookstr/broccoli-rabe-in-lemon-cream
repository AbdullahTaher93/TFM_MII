Cook the broccoli rabe in abundant salted boiling water until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain. Melt the butter in a large sautÃ© pan. Add the rabe and stir well to coat. Add salt to taste and let the flavors meld over low heat for about 5 minutes. Add the cream and lemon juice. Toss gently and let warm over low heat. Serve surrounded with crisp buttered crostini.
