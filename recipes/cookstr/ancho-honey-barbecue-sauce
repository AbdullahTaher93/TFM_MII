Combine the onion, garlic, and chiles in a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan. Toast the herbs and spices together in a small skillet until very fragrant and add to the pan. Add the salt, tomatoes and water, cover and cook over medium heat 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool a bit then blend until smooth. Strain the sauce back into the rinsed pan, pressing on the solids. Add the honey, brown sugar, molasses, vinegar, and juices and bring to a simmer. Cook the sauce slowly for about 45 minutes, till thickened some, and the flavors have mellowed. Add more salt if needed, and more honey if itâ€™s too spicy. Makes about 6 cups of sauce. Extra sauce stores several weeks in the fridge, a few months in the freezer.
