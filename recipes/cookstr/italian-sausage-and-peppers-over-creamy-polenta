In a large saucepan over high heat, combine the milk and water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and add the polenta. Stir in the butter and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the polenta is cooked through, bubbles up and thickens, about 20 minutes. Stir in the cheese, season to taste with salt and pepper, and keep warm. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Fry the sausages until nicely browned on all sides and cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the sausages from the wok and set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the peppers and onions to the drippings in the wok. Cook over high heat until the onions are golden brown and the peppers are slightly blistered, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with the oregano, a pinch or two of red pepper flakes, and salt to taste. Return the sausages to the wok and toss to combine. Divide the polenta among the plates and top each portion with some of the sausage mixture
