Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a bowl, mix the seeds with the olive oil and soy sauce, stirring well. Sprinkle on the chili powder, garlic powder, and salt; stir again. Roast the seasoned seeds on a baking sheet about 10 minutes or a little longer, stirring a couple of times. The seeds are done when they smell toasty and are golden brown.
