Fill a large bowl with very warm water and line two baking sheets or jelly roll pans with plastic wrap. Dip one sheet of rice paper into the hot water and leave it in the water several seconds until it is soft and pliable. Remove to work surface (lined jelly roll pan) and cover with a damp paper towel. Repeat until all rice papers are softened. On a piece of plastic wrap or wax paper arrange a lettuce leaf in the middle of the rice paper, leaving a 1-inch border around the outside edge. Top with a heaping tablespoon of rice noodles, spreading down the center of the lettuce. Cover the noodles with about 1 tablespoon of grated carrot and sprinkle equal amounts of the three fresh herbs over this and two slices of the cooked shrimp. Fold in the two opposite sides of the rice paper and tightly roll up. Transfer to the second plastic lined jelly roll pan and cover with plastic. Continue until all 12 are finished. These may be prepared 4 hours ahead of serving. (Covering and refrigerating the finished rolls keeps them from drying out. They will also slice more easily if they have time to chill.) In a small bowl, whisk together all ingredients to make the Hoisin Sauce. Chill if making a day ahead. When ready to serve, cut each spring roll in half diagonally and arrange on a platter, cut side up. Serve with the room temperature dipping sauce or your favorite spicy peanut sauce. (I like to have both available.)
