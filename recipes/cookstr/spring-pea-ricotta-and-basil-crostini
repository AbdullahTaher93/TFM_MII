Preheat the broiler. In a small pot, bring the water and salt to a boil. Add the peas and cook for 4 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Pat dry. In a food processor, combine the peas, the ¼ cup basil, oil, cheese, and salt and pepper. Process until creamy. Taste and add more salt or pepper as needed. Cut the baguette into sixteen ¼-inch-wide slices. Place the bread slices on a baking sheet and spray or brush them on both sides with olive oil. Broil until the bread is a light golden-brown color, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn slices and repeat. (Watch carefully, as bread can burn easily.) Remove from broiler and let cool. To assemble, spread about 1 tablespoon of the pea mixture on each slice of bread. Sprinkle with remaining chopped basil. Serve immediately.
