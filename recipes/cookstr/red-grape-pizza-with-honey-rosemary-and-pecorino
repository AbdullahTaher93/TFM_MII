Preheat your oven to 400°F. Dissolve the yeast with a teaspoon of the honey in half the water and put to one side. Mix the flour with a good pinch of salt and shape into a pile on a clean work surface. Make a well in the centre and, when the yeast and honey mix has frothed up, pour it into the well and mix gradually with the flour until it’s all soaked up. Pour on the rest of the tepid water and mix in all the flour to make a nice, moist, soft dough. Place in a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for 15 minutes or so. Meanwhile, bash the rosemary in a pestle and mortar, add a little olive oil and bash again. Cut the grapes in half and put to one side. When the dough has doubled in size, place it on the work surface and knead until smooth. Cut the dough into 4 pieces, knead each piece again briefly and shape them into 4 small pizzas. Brush the pizzas with the bashed rosemary sprigs, leaving them smeared with rosemary oil, then scatter with the halved red grapes. Drizzle each pizza with a teaspoon of honey, and, finally, shave some pecorino over the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until the pizza bases are cooked and the cheese is bubbling and melted.
