Heat a 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Add butter and olive oil. Add onion and cook for 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook to just release the flavor (about 1 minute). Add chicken broth, cumin, pasilla or chili powder, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add beans and chicken, and cook for another 5 minutes or until chicken is heated through. Add tomatoes and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into warm bowls. Serve with cilantro, green onion, avocado, feta, lime wedges, and tortilla strips on the side. Let your guests enjoy creating the finishing touches. To Make the Tortilla Strips: Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat, add tortilla strips, and cook for 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel.
