Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Place the whole limes on a small baking tray and roast for 10 to 12 minutes, until the skins have softened. Set aside to cool. In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, ginger, scallions, and honey. When the limes have cooled, cut them in half and squeeze to extract as much juice as possible. Stir the lime juice into the soy mixture until well blended. Drizzle the chicken, beef, or fish with enough marinade to coat and refrigerate for a few hours. The marinade will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
