Heat a large high-sided sauté pan over high heat until it is so hot that a drop of water will bounce when it hits the surface. Throw on the chopped meat. Spread it out flat with a heavy spatula using a random chopping motion to disperse the meat evenly and break it up into small clusters. Add the onions and cook for 10 to 20 minutes, until the meat is brown all over and the onions have softened and begun to melt away. Sprinkle with the cumin, jalapeño peppers, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano, and sauté for a few more minutes. Add the marinara sauce and the coffee, and cook for about 15 minutes to burn off some of the liquid. Turn off the heat and leave the chili alone for about 20 minutes so that the fat will rise to the top. Sprinkle with a thin layer of masarepa; this helps absorb the oil. Once you can see that the fat has been absorbed, stir the masarepa into the chili. Simmer the chili over low heat for another 20 minutes (or longer if you like; you can’t cook it too much). Add water or more coffee to the chili if it gets too thick, and season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
