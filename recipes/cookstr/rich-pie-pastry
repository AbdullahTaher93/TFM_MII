Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Cut the butter into the flour using your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) until the texture resembles coarse meal with visible bits of butter. Stir the egg into the flour mixture and stir or pulse until incorporated. Pinch off a small handful of dough; if it doesn’t hold together, add ice water ½ tablespoon at a time, stirring or pulsing after each addition. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat into a disk about ½-inch thick. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.
