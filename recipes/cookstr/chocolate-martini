Pour ¼ inch of vermouth, vodka, or water into a rimmed saucer. Place ¼ inch of the ground chocolate on a second saucer slightly larger than the rim of the glass. Swirl each glass with a splash of vermouth, and pour it out. To create the chocolate rim, dip the rim of the glass in the vermouth, vodka, or water, then in the ground chocolate. For each drink, pour 2 parts chocolate liqueur to 1 part vodka into a shaker with ice. Shake and pour into the glass.
