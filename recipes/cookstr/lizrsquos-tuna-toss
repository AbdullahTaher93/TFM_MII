Bring 3 quarts lightly salted water to a boil in a covered 4Â½-quart or larger pot. When the water reaches a rapid boil, add the pasta and cook, uncovered, until just tender, following the package directions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic to the pan and cook to soften, 1 minute. Drain the tuna well, add it to the skillet, and stir to flake the tuna chunks. Add the tomatoes with their juice. Stir in the anchovy paste (if using), tomato paste, sugar, and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, 5 minutes. While the sauce is cooking, chop the parsley (if using) and add it to the skillet. If the sauce starts to stick, reduce the heat to low. Drain the pasta in a colander, then pour it back into the cooking pot (off the heat). Pour the sauce into the pot and toss to coat the pasta with the sauce. Serve at once.
