Bake the cookies according to directions and allow them to cool thoroughly on wire racks. Arrange 3 dozen of the cookies, flat side up, on a work surface. Spread each with some ice cream. Top with another cookie, making sure the flat side is facing the ice cream. Roll the ice cream edge of each sandwich in chocolate chips so that the ice cream layer is coated in chips. Wrap each in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 2 months. Remove from the freezer about 10 minutes before you plan to serve them.
