To make the sauce: Place all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine. Cover and store in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or longer to allow the flavors to meld. Use immediately, or store in a tightly sealed glass container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To make the ribs: Rinse the ribs, pat dry with paper towels, and slice them into individual pieces. Combine the ribs and sauce in a large container. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight or for at least 4 hours. Brush the grill rack generously with oil and preheat the grill to medium-low. Remove the ribs from the marinade. Reserve the marinade. Place the ribs on the rack and grill, basting frequently with the remaining marinade. Stop basting 5 minutes before the ribs are done. Discard any unused marinade. Grill the ribs until they are golden brown, tender, and no longer pink inside, 12 to 15 minutes per side. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and serve hot.
