1 Preheat the oven to 450°F and butter an 11-inch tart pan. Roll, shape, and flute the shell (do not bake). In a food processor or blender, process the almonds and cinnamon until the nuts are finely ground but not powdery. 2 In a medium-size bowl, with an electric mixer on high, cream the butter. Beat in the confectioners’ sugar, then add the eggs one at a time, beating until thick and light yellow. Beat in the almonds, then beat in the orange zest, orange juice, and rum. 3 Pour the filling into the unbaked shell. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Bake 15 minutes more or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes, then chill 15 minutes. 4 Pick out the best berry and stand it in the center of the tart, pointed end up. Cut half of the berries vertically in half. Slice the remaining berries vertically ¼ inch thick. Starting at the edge, arrange the berries, slightly on a slant, in alternating circles of sliced berries and halved berries (cut-side down) until you reach the center berry and the tart is covered with berries. 5 In a small saucepan, boil the jelly and granulated sugar over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until the glaze thickens. Drizzle the glaze over the tart and chill for 1 hour. Store any leftover tart in the refrigerator.
