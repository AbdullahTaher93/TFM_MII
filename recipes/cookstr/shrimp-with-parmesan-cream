Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook for 5 minutes until beginning to brown. Add the scallions and garlic, and cook 3 minutes more, or until the scallions are just beginning to soften. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, until they are almost completely opaque. Add the créme fraîche and bring just to a simmer. Stir in the lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Lower the heat and simmer until the shrimp are opaque throughout, about 1 minute. Transfer to a serving dish. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and garnish with spinach. Serve hot. Variation Pasta with Shrimp: Turn this into a main dish for 4 by serving it as a sauce over spaghetti.
