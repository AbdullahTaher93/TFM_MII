In the carafe of a blender, combine all ingredients. Blend for 10 seconds, or until smooth. Pour the mixture into a clean, quart-sized glass jar. Barely screw on the lid—gasses need to be able to escape. Skip this step and there’ll be broken glass to pick up later. Stash the jar in a warm (80° to 85°F would be nice) place for 24 hours. Use right away or feed it another cup of warm water mixed with a cup of flour and stash it in the refrigerator. Every time you use a cup of culture, feed the starter a cup of water and flour.
