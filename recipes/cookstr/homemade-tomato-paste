In a food processor or blender, combine the sundried tomatoes with the oil from the jar, the tomato paste, tomatoes with their juices, salt, and 2 tablespoons water. Puree until smooth. Scrape into the cazuela and set over medium-low heat. Cook slowly, stirring often, until the tomato mixture reduces to a thick jam, about 30 minutes. Scrape the tomato paste into a clean jar. Cover with Â¼ inch of olive oil and the lid and store in the refrigerator. This paste keeps well for up to 2 months.
