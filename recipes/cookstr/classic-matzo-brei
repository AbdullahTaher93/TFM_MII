Soak matzos in cold water for about 10 minutes and drain. Break them into bite size squares and place in large bowl. Beat eggs with salt and pour over matzos. Stir until matzos are coated. Melt butter in a heavy skillet. Add the matzo mixture. Cook over low heat, stirring, until the eggs are scrambled and done to your taste. Serve at once.
