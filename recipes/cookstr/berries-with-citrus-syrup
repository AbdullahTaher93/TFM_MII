Place the mixed berries in a serving dish. Bring the sugar and Â½ cup water to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to high and boil for 5 minutes, until slightly reduced. Let cool. Stir in the lemon zest and orange juice. Pour the syrup over the berries, and sprinkle with the mint leaves. Let stand for at least 10 minutes. Transfer to dessert glasses and serve.
