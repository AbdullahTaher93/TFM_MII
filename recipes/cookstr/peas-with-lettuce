Prepare ahead Step 1 can be completed several hours ahead. Refrigerate until ready to use. Put the onions in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Let stand a few minutes. Drain, peel, and trim the onions, keeping the root end intact. Melt 2 tbsp of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, cover, and cook for about 2 minutes. Add the peas and stock and bring to a boil. Skim off any foam, then add the sugar and season with salt and pepper. Lower the heat and simmer for 5â€“8 minutes or until the peas are tender. Mash the remaining butter and flour together to make a smooth paste. A little at a time, stir the butter mixture into the peas, to thicken the sauce. Stir in the shredded lettuce and mint. Adjust the seasoning and serve immediately.
