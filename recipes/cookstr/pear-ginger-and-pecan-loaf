Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Lightly butter and flour an 8½ × 4½ × 2½-inch loaf pan and tap out the excess flour. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to combine. In another bowl, whisk the sugar, pear juice, oil, and eggs until well mixed. Pour into the dry ingredients and whisk just until smooth. Fold in the pear, pecans, and ginger. Scrape into the pan and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Unmold the cake and cool completely.
