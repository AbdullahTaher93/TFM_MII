Put the oats, salt, butter, and milk in a 4-quart slow cooker. If youâ€™re using raisins or other dried fruits, add them now (see Note). Cook, covered, on the low setting for 6 to 8 hours, until the oats are soft but still a bit chewy. Serve hot, with the fixings of your choice. Oatmeal is good served like grits, with a pat of butter and salt and pepper. Or pour some cold buttermilk, cream, or milk over it. Or stir in some raisins or dried cranberries or cherries when you put the oats in the slow cooker, then top the finished oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon and serve with milk.
