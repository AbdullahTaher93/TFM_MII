Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare the tart shell. In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the rhubarb with 3/4 cup of the sugar and the crystallized ginger for 5 to 7 minutes, or until just tender. Remove from the heat, stir in the egg yolks, and pile the mixture into a partially baked tart shell. Bake for 10 minutes. In a clean, dry, glass or stainless steel bowl, whip the egg whites with the lemon juice and salt until they hold peaks. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar to the beaten egg whites and continue whipping until very firm. Pile the meringue into a large self-sealing food storage bag. Seal the bag and cut 1 inch off one of the corners, then pipe the meringue through the snipped-off corner of the bag onto the rhubarb filling in an attractive pattern. Be sure to cover the filling completely. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the meringue is delicately browned. Remove from the oven and cool completely before serving.
