Take several of the leaves at a time and stack them on top of each other, then roll them up tightly like a cigar and slice crosswise with a large sharp knife to produce very thin strips, called chiffonade. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare an ice bath. Blanch the greens in the boiling water for about 2 minutes. Drain and immerse the greens in the ice bath to stop the cooking. Drain and squeeze dry. Meanwhile, combine the chopped bacon with the olive oil in a large saute pan and heat until hot. Add the onion and saute until soft, about 10 minutes. Toss in the dried chile and crushed garlic and toss until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Add the greens and toss over high heat until wilted and glossy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the chile and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and serve.
