Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C, or gas mark 6). Process the nuts into a fine powder in the food processor, and then add the remaining ingredients except the jam. Transfer to a large bowl, and using your hands, form a dough ball. If it’s too sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon (8 g) at a time, until it’s easy to handle. Remove one-third of the dough ball and set aside. Roll our the larger dough ball to fit your pans. The dough will be a bit crumbly, but this is normal. Place into your pans and press down to even out the appearance. Spoon the raspberry filling into the crusts. Roll out the remaining dough and either use cookie cutters to cut out small shapes or use a pastry wheel to cut strips for a lattice-style top crust. Place the desired crust atop the jam. Bake for 25 to 30 minures until the jam is bubbly and the crust is golden brown. Dust with confectioners’ sugar when cool. Variations: Add 1 tablespoon (5 g) cocoa powder to the crust. Substitute hazelnurs or walnuts for the almonds. Substitute ling on berry, apricot, or fig jam for the raspberry.
