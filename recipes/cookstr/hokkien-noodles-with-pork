Put the mushrooms in a heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water, and set aside for 30 minutes to soak. Drain and cut the mushrooms into thin strips. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Mix the oyster sauce, soy sauce, and honey together in a small bowl. Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan over high heat. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 15 seconds. Add the red pepper, stir-fry for 3 minutes, then add the snow peas, and stir-fry for 1 minute, until they turn bright green. Meanwhile, add the noodles to the boiling water and cook for 1 minute. Add the pork to the wok, pour in the oyster sauce mixture and toss over the heat for 1 minute, until everything is heated. Drain the noodles, mix with the stir-fried pork and vegetables, and serve hot.
