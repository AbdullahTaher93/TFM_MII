In a small, nonstick skillet over medium heat, toast the paprika until it begins to brown around the edges and starts to smoke. Remove from heat. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and add the paprika, onion, and garlic. Cook until the onion is translucent. Add the carrot juice, wine, water, thyme, bay leaves, and dates and bring to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 10 minutes until most of the liquid absorbs and the pasta is al dente. Set aside the larger pieces of chestnut and fold the smaller pieces into the pasta. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the bay leaves and sprinkle with the large pieces of chestnut and chive. Drizzle with smoked olive oil immediately before serving.
