Slice the zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Lay them out in a single layer on a rack and let dry overnight. Preheat the broiler. Brush the zucchini slices with olive oil, add salt and pepper to taste, and put them on a baking sheet. Broil until lightly browned and then turn to brown the other side, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce the oven temperature to 350Â°F. Spoon a bit of the tomato sauce over the bottom of a 9 x 12-inch baking dish or casserole. Arrange the zucchini slices in a single layer. You may need to cut them to fit the dish. Top with a slightly overlapping layer of provolone cheese and spread a few tablespoons of tomato sauce over the cheese. Repeat the layering of zucchini, provolone cheese, and tomato sauce twice, ending with the tomato sauce. Mix the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese together in a small bowl and sprinkle over the top. Bake for 30 minutes, until it is bubbling and the top is browned. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving.
