Immerse the skewers before lighting the grill, so they have plenty of time to soak. Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill on medium-high. To assemble the skewers, thread 5 tomatoes onto each skewer, placing a basil leaf, folded in half crosswise, between the tomatoes. Arrange the skewers in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and brush the tomatoes generously on all sides with the olive oil. To create a cool zone, bank the coals to one side of the grill or turn off one of the burners. Oil the grill grate. Place the skewers directly over the medium-hot fire and grill, turning once, until light grill marks appear on both sides, about 30 seconds per side. Move the skewers to the cooler part of the grill, cover, and grill until the tomatoes are hot but the skin hasnâ€™t blistered, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the skewers to a serving platter and season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.
