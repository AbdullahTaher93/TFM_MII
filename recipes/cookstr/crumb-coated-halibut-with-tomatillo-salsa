Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Rinse the fish and pat dry, then place on an aluminum foil-covered baking sheet. Top each fillet with a squeeze of lemon juice from half the lemon. Mix the bread crumbs and chile together, then sprinkle on the top, bottom, and sides of each. Place in the oven and bake until the fish flakes easily (approximately 8 to 10 minutes) when pierced with a fork. Cut the remaining half lemon lengthwise into quarters. Serve the fish napped with the salsa and a lemon wedge. 2. Mix the bread crumbs and chile together, then sprinkle on the top, bottom, and sides of each.
