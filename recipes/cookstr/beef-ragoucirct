In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until very hot. Add half of the beef and brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes total, transfer to the slow cooker. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and brown the remaining beef. Add the onions to the skillet and brown slightly over medium-high heat. Add the tomatoes and wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the pan; pour into the cooker. Add the carrots, garlic, tapioca, and Italian herbs to the cooker. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 7 hours. Add the salt, pepper, zucchini, and mushrooms, cover, turn the cooker to HIGH, and cook for about 45 minutes, until the meat, mushrooms, and zucchini are tender. Serve in shallow bowls or on rimmed dinner plates.
