Combine the saffron and 2 tbsp of the fish stock in a small bowl. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes, until translucent. Add the tomatoes and paprika and cook for 5 minutes. Add the pasta, 2 cups of the remaining stock, and the soaked saffron. Bring to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes. Add the fish, shrimp, mussels, scallops, and peas to the frying pan. Continue cooking until the pasta is tender, adding more stock as needed to keep the mixture moist. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve directly from the pan.
