For Easy-to-Chew and Soft Diets: To make the pesto, place all of the pesto ingredients except for the water in a mini-food processor, and process until the herbs and nuts are finely ground. Add the water and process just until mixed in. Add a little more water or olive oil, if needed, to bring the pesto to a consistency that can be drizzled from a spoon or squeeze bottle. Transfer to a small squeeze bottle or other container, and chill until ready to use. To make the soup, place the olive oil, onion, and celery in a 3-quart pot. Cover and cook over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally, for several minutes or until the vegetables begin to soften. Add a little water if needed to prevent scorching. Add the garlic and cook for 15 additional seconds. Add the sweet potato and broth to the pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 10 minutes or just until the potatoes are soft. Add the jalapeno pepper to the pot, and purée the soup with a hand-held blender until smooth. Serve hot, drizzling each serving with about a tablespoon of the pesto. For Smooth/Puréed Diets: Working in batches, purée the entire pot of soup in a standing blender until smooth (see Notes). Process the pesto until smooth and, if necessary, push through a strainer to remove any coarse bits before drizzling the condiment over the soup.
