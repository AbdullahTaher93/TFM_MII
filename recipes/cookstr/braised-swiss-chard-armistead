Cut the chard stems into bite-sized pieces, and cut the leaves into 2-inch wide strips. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and then salt the water. Add the chard stems and boil for 3 minutes. Add the leaves and cook for about 1 minute longer. Drain well and press out any excess moisture. In the same pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 4 minutes. Then, add the garlic and anchovies and stir until the anchovies melt into the oil and the garlic is translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chard and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle a little cheese over the top, if desired, and allow it to melt in. Serve warm.
