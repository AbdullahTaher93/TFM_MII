Preheat the oven to 350Â°F Cut the squash and onions into wedges and place separately on aluminum foil-lined baking sheets. Scatter over the garlic and sage or rosemary and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle 4 tablespoons of the oil over the vegetables and bake them in the oven for about 30 minutes or until the squash is soft. The onions might take a little longer to cook, so just remove the pumpkin and carry on cooking the onions. Once both vegetables are cooked, set aside. This can be done in advance and the vegetables reheated later. Preheat the grill to high. Place the vegetables in a gratin dish or on a heat-proof plate. Break the feta into small cubes and sprinkle over the vegetables. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over the feta and broil until the cheese is light golden brown. Serve with toasted pita or flatbread and a little salad.
