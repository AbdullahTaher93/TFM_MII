Make an “X” in the root end of each onion. In a pot of lightly salted boiling water, blanch the onions for about 1 minute. Cool and peel. Return the onions to boiling water, reduce the heat, and simmer until tender. Drain. In a skillet, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the onions, shaking the pan to coat the onions with butter. Sprinkle with the sugar and cook until the sugar beings to caramelize. When the onions take on a caramel color, serve.
