To make the jerk paste, either pound the ingredients together using a mortar and pestle or place in a blender or food processor and process. With the motor running, slowly add enough of the oil to make a paste. Place the roast, fat side down, in a nonreactive pan. Make slashes in the pork about 1½ to 2 inches apart and almost through the roast. Rub the jerk paste over the meat, making sure to get it thoroughly into the slashes. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator overnight. Remove the roast and bring to room temperature. Prepare either the grill or smoker. If using a grill, be sure to use a pan under the pork to catch the drippings so that they don’t flare up and burn the meat. Smoke the pork for about 2 to 3 hours, turning the roast every 30 minutes to ensure even browning. Cook until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 150°F. Allow the meat to sit for 10 minutes to reabsorb all the juices and for the temperature to rise to 160°F. Then carve the meat and mound on a platter to serve. Variations: Substitute lamb chops, chicken, or turkey for the pork. Variations: Substitute lamb chops, chicken, or turkey for the pork.
