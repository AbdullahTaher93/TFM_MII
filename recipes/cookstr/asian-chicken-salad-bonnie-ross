In a 10-inch skillet, toast the almonds over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Do not burn them. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, vegetables, and sesame seeds. Toss well. In a medium-sized bowl, dissolve the miso in the warm water. Add the mayonnaise, ginger, tamari, sesame oil, sugar, salt, and pepper to the miso water and mix well with a spoon until blended. Pour over the salad and toss well. Top the salad with the almonds and serve.
