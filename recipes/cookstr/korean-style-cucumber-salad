Cut the cucumbers and onion into very fine slices (a food processor may be used for this). Sprinkle with salt, mix well, and set aside in a bowl for an hour. Drain all the accumulated liquid and discard. Add the lemon juice, cayenne pepper (Koreans like this dish very hot), sesame seeds, and sesame oil. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate. Serve cold or at room temperature.
