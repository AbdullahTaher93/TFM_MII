First, heat the olive oil in a pan. Add the scallions, chile and tomatoes and stir for a few minutes. Take off the heat and set aside. Scramble the eggs, adding the cheese at the last minute. Stir in the chiles-tomato mixture and season. In a nonstick pan, heat the tortillas one after the other, for about 30 seconds each side. Put flat on a plate and spoon on the egg mixture, with the parsley, and roll them up.
