Heat the oil in a heavy (preferably cast-iron) pot over medium heat for about 2 minutes. Add the flour and blend. Stir slowly and constantly. To make a blond roux, the color of sandpaper, it will take about 8 minutes. For a roux the color of peanut butter, cook for about 12 minutes. A dark roux one the color of chocolate, will take 15 to 18 minutes. As it cooks, the roux will thicken.
