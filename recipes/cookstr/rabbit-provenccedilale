Pour off all but 1 tbsp of the fat in the casserole. Add the pancetta and onion to the pan and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring, until the pancetta is browned and the onion softened. Add the garlic and stir for about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, rosemary, and sage, and season with salt and pepper.

Garnish with the rosemary sprigs and serve. 4. Remove the pan from the heat and let stand about 10 minutes. Garnish with the rosemary sprigs and serve.
