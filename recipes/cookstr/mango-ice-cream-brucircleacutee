Slit vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape seeds into a medium saucepan. Add vanilla pod, ½ cup (125 mL) of the milk and the cream. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Remove from heat and let stand for 15 minutes, allowing the flavor of the vanilla to infuse. Remove and discard vanilla pod. Meanwhile, in a food processor or blender, puree egg yolks, mangos, the remaining 1 cup (250 mL) milk, sugar and salt until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and whisk in the vanilla mixture. Return entire mixture to the saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Be careful not to let it boil. Strain into a clean large bowl. Let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until completely cold or overnight. Stir cream mixture. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer’s instructions. While ice cream is still a bit runny, transfer to six ½-cup (125 mL) ramekins, tapping on counter to remove any air. Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap and store in the freezer, making sure they’re flat. Just before you’re ready to serve, remove ramekins from freezer and sprinkle each with 1 tbsp (15 mL) turbinado sugar. Using a butane or propane torch (see Notes), heat the sugar until it bubbles and changes color.
