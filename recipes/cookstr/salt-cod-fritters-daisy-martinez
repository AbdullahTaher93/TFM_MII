Stir the flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add the water and stir until no lumps remain. Stir in the salt cod and cilantro. Let the batter sit while the oil heats. Pour enough oil into a large, deep skillet to fill 1 inch. Heat over medium heat until the tip of the handle of a wooden spoon gives off a lively sizzle when you dip it in the oil (about 375°F). Taste the batter and add a little more salt if you think it needs it. Scoop up a mounded tablespoon of the batter and slip it carefully into the oil. Fry as many fritters at one time as will bob around freely in the skillet. If you fry too many at one time, the temperature of the oil will drop, and you’ll have soggy, not crispy fritters. Fry until cooked through and deep golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve hot. Repeat with the remaining batter.
