Place the potatoes in salted water to cover in a large pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and place in a food processor. Pulse until almost pureed; then add the butter and cream and continue to pulse until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Use ½ cup heavy cream For celery root puree, substitute 2¾ pounds celery root (about 4) peeled and cut into 1½-inch pieces, for the sweet potatoes. Use 2/3 cut heavy cream.
