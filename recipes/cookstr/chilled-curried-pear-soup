In a large pot, melt 5 tbsp (75 mL) of the butter over medium-high heat. Add pears, onions, leeks and garlic; sauté for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and sauté for 1 minute. Sprinkle with flour and curry powder; sauté for 5 minutes or until pears are soft. Gradually whisk in stock and wine; simmer for 15 minutes, reducing heat if necessary, until soup is velvety and slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, prepare the garnish: In a small skillet, heat the remaining butter over medium-high heat. Add green onions and sauté for 2 minutes. Add honey and sesame oil; sauté for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in yogurt. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Using an immersion blender, or in a food processor or blender in batches, pureé soup until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours, or overnight. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary. Ladle into chilled bowls and top with yogurt garnish. Draw a chopstick or knife through the yogurt to create a decorative swirl.
