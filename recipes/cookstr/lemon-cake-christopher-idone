Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly butter a 10-cup Bundt or fluted tube pan. In a medium bowl combine the cake mix and instant pudding and set aside. In a large glass measuring cup, combine the lemon juice and enough cold water to make 2/3 cup of liquid. Add to the dry ingredients along with the eggs and lemon extract and mix on low speed. Pour in the oil and beat at medium speed until the mixture is smooth. Pour mixture into the prepared pan. Bake for 45 minutes or until the top is golden and the cake is springy to the touch. Prepare the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk the 1 cup confectioners’ sugar, lemon juice, zest, and lemon extract until smooth. Set aside. Cool the cake for 5 minutes. Unmold onto a plate. Using a poultry needle or toothpick, pierce 1-inch-deep holes into the top of the cake. Slowly spoon the glaze over the cake and cool completely. When ready to serve, dust with the remaining 2 tablespoons confectioner’s sugar and serve with fresh berries and Crème Anglaise.
