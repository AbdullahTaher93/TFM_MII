Preheat, the oven to 425°F. Lay a 2-foot-long piece of aluminum foil on a baking sheet, and set it aside. Cut the rib rack in half; season it generously with salt and pepper. Place the ribs on the prepared baking sheet. In a medium bowl, combine the paprika, liquid smoke, ketchup, and red wine vinegar. Pour the sauce over the meat, turning to coat it completely. Scatter the onions and garlic over the sauce. Place another piece of foil on top, and fold up the edges of the foil to make a tightly sealed package. Roast the ribs for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 275°F, and bake until the meat is tender, about 1 hour. Slicing in between the bones, cut the ribs into 4 portions, and serve.
