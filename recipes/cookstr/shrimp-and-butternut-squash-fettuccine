Cook fettucine according to package directions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat and sauté squash until nicely browned. In a sauce pan, reduce Madeira by half (takes about 5 minutes). Add shrimp to the sauté pan with squash and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the reduced Madeira, thyme and butter.
