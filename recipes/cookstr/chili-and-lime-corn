1) Heat the oil in a large nonstick Saut√© pan. Cook the garlic over low heat until golden. Stir in the jalapeno and scallions and cook briefly. Stir in the chili powder, salt, and cumin and cook for about 30 seconds, until the aroma intensifies. 2) Stir in the corn and zest. Cover and cook until the corn is warmed through and no longer tastes raw. Add 1 tablespoon water if the mixture looks too dry.
