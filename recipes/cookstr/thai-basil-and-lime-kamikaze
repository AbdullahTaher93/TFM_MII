Pick the basil leaves from the stem and set I leaf aside for garnish. Chill a martini glass. In a mixing glass, half filled with crushed ice or broken-up ice cubes, muddle the vodka, Triple Sec, and lime with a bar stick. Add the basil leaves and bruise them. Strain into the chilled martini glass, garnish with the remaining basil leaf, and serve.
