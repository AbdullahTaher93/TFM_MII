Bring the coconut milk to a bare simmer in a small saucepan over low heat. Remove from the heat and add the white chocolate. Let stand a few minutes, then stir until the chocolate melts. Pour into a bowl and let cool. Purèe the strawberries and confectioner's sugar in a food processor. Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add the strawberry purèe, whipped cream, lime zest and juice, and rum to the coconut mixture and fold together. Pour into a freezerproof container and cover. Freeze at least 6 hours, or until firm. Scoop into dessert glasses, garnish with lime wedges and fresh strawberries, and serve immediately.
