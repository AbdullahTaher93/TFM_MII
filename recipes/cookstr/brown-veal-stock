Preheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly salt the bones and arrange them in a large roasting pan in a single layer. Cook until well browned on both sides, about 1 to 1½ hours, turning halfway through. Carefully pour off the accumulated fat. Add the onions, carrots, celery; and garlic. Plop the tomato paste on top of the bones, and roast for another 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer the bones and vegetables to a large stockpot (at least 8 quarts), using tongs. Pour off the fat from the roasting pan and place it over 2 burners on your stove; turn on the heat to medium. Add 2 cups of water. Gently loosen the brown bits from the pan with a wooden spoon. When all the brown bits have been loosened, transfer the liquid to the stockpot and add another 3 quarts of water, or enough to cover the bones completely. Add the bay leaves, thyme, and peppercorns and bring to a simmer. Skim any foam that rises to the surface, and cook over the lowest simmer possible for 4 to 6 hours, longer if possible. Let cool slightly, then strain the stock through a colander into a large bowl, discarding the solids. Strain again through a fine mesh sieve (lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter if you have it) into another large bowl. Cool completely, then chill. After it’s chilled, remove the fat from the top. At this point, the stock can be returned to a saucepan and reduced by half for demi-glace, or it can be divided into small containers and refrigerated for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 6 months.
