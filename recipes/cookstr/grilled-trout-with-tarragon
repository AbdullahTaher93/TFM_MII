Using the back of a spoon, mash the garlic and salt to a paste in a shallow glass or ceramic dish. Whisk in the oil, lemon juice, chopped tarragon sprigs, and pepper. Add the fish to the marinade and turn to coat completely. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Prepare coals for grilling until covered with white ash, or preheat the broiler. Oil the grill or broiler rack. Remove the fish from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and make a few crosswise incisions in the skin to prevent it from breaking during grilling. Grill or broil the fish 2 to 3 inches away from the heat, basting lightly with the reserved marinade. After 5 minutes, turn the fish and grill until opaque throughout, 5 to 6 minutes more. Serve garnished with pomegranate seeds and tarragon sprigs.
