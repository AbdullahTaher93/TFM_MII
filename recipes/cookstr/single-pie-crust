Measure the water into a liquid measuring cup and place it in the freezer just while you are measuring and mixing the other ingredients. In a large bowl, whisk together the baking mix, salt, and xanthan gum. Then cut in the chilled shortening with a pastry cutter (do not use your hands). There should be lumps the size of peas in the dough; it is very important not to over mix the dough. Add the water a small amount at a time, tossing lightly with a fork to mix just until the dough begins to come together. Dump the dough out onto plastic wrap and wrap tightly. Press the dough into a ball, then flatten it into a disk. Double wrap the dough and let it chill for at least 30 minutes. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and roll it out between 2 sheets of parchment paper (or on a floured pastry cloth), rolling from the middle in one direction only and turning an eighth of a turn with each roll, until the dough is 1/8 inch thick and a large enough circle to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Remove the parchment paper and press the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. If the dough cracks, just press it back together with your fingers. Crimp the edges and use according to your recipeâ€™s instructions. Store the unbaked pie crust, tightly wrapped and frozen, for up to 2 months.
