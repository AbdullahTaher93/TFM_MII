Crumble the saffron threads into a small bowl, add 2 tbsp boiling water, and set aside for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the coriander and cumin. In batches, cook the chicken, stirring often, for 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add the remaining oil to the saucepan and heat. Add the onion, red pepper, and garlic and cook, stirring often, about 5 minutes, until softened. Stir in the rice. Return the chicken to the saucepan and stir in the stock, along with the saffron and its liquid, Â½ tsp salt, and the bay leaves. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer for 15 minutes. Rinse and drain the chickpeas then stir in along with the raisins, and cook about 5 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer to a warm serving platter and serve hot, sprinkled with almonds and parsley.
