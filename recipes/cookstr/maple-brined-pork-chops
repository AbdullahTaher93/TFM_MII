Make the brine: Combine the maple syrup, brown sugar, salt, mustard seeds, peppercorns, bay leaf, and thyme with 4 cups of water in a large saucepan. Heat the brine over high heat and stir until the brown sugar and salt dissolve. Remove the pan from the heat. Add 1 cup of ice water. Pour the brine into a glass or ceramic dish just large enough to hold the pork chops and refrigerate it until chilled. (The brine should be chilled so that it doesn’t raise the temperature of the chops when they are added.) Prepare the pork chops: Place the chops in the brine, making sure the meat is completely submerged. Cover the dish and refrigerate the chops for at least 24 hours or up to 48 hours. Remove the pork chops from the brine and discard the brine. Rinse the chops under cold water and dry them thoroughly with paper towels. Brush both sides of the chops with the maple syrup. Let the chops sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F. Brush the chops with olive oil. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chops until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the chops until they are firm to the touch and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted through the side into the center of one registers 145°F, 8 to 15 minutes. (Don’t let the thermometer touch the bone.) Let the chops rest for 5 minutes, then serve warm.
