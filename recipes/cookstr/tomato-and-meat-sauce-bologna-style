Drain the tomatoes, reserving their juice. Strain the captured juice to hold back the seeds. Using your fingers, push out the excess seeds from each tomato. Chop the tomatoes and set the tomatoes and juice aside. In a large, wide Dutch oven or large, deep skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with the olive oil over low heat. Stir in the onion, celery, carrot, and parsley and saute over low heat until the vegetables are quite soft but not at all browned, about 12 minutes. Keeping the heat very low, add the ground meat and prosciutto. The meat must heat very gently, only enough to color it lightly on the outside; preventing it from hardening allows it to absorb the flavors of the other ingredients and to become delicate and creamy. Stir in the salt and wine. Simmer very gently for several minutes until the alcohol evaporates and the liquid begins to be absorbed by the meat and vegetables. Now add the milk and nutmeg. (It is important to add the milk before adding the tomatoes so that it will be absorbed by the meat.) Simmer gently for 10 minutes, then add the tomatoes and juice. As soon as the sauce begins to simmer, turn the heat down as low as possible; if your burner cannot be regulated to a setting that is low enough, insert a flame tamer between the burner and the pan. Cover partially and continue to simmer, always over the lowest possible heat and stirring occasionally, for about 4 hours. When the sauce is finished, stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the pepper. Check and adjust for salt.
