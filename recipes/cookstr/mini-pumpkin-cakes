MAKE THE PUMPKIN CUPCAKES Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line mini cupcake pans with paper liners. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the eggs, sugar, pumpkin, and oil on medium-high speed until well blended. With the mixer on low, add the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda and mix just until blended. Fill the lined cupcake pans three-quarters full with the batter. Bake the cupcakes for 15 to 20 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out with a fine crumb. Remove the pans from the oven. Transfer the cupcakes to wire racks to cool. Cool completely before frosting. MAKE THE FROSTING In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter and mascarpone on low speed until smooth. Gradually add the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla and beat on high speed for 5 to 8 minutes, or until very light and fluffy. ASSEMBLE THE CUPCAKES Fill a pastry bag with the frosting. Cut off the tip of the pastry bag to make a small opening. Pipe the frosting onto the tops of the cupcakes, starting at the outer edges and circling in to the centers. Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.
