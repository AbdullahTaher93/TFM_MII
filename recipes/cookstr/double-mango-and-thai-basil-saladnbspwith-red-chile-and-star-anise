In a small bowl, mix the sliced Brazil nuts with the agave nectar, chili powder, and a generous pinch of salt, tossing to coat the nuts. Spread the nuts on a Teflex-lined dehydrator tray and dehydrate at 115Â°F for 24 to 48 hours. The longer they dehydrate, the crunchier they will be. Place the green mangoes in a medium bowl and sprinkle with about 2 teaspoons of sea salt. Toss well and let stand for 30 minutes or more. The salt will soften the mangos. In a blender, blend the flesh of one of the ripe mangoes with the red chile and enough coconut water to thin it to a smooth sauce consistency. Season with a pinch of salt and a pinch of star anise. Transfer the sauce to a squeeze bottle or separate container and set aside. Cut the flesh of the second ripe mango into thin strips and add to the bowl of green mango, along with the basil, tossing to combine. Paint each of the serving plates with the mango sauce, arrange a pile of the mango salad on each, sprinkle with the Brazil nuts, and garnish the plate with additional ground star anise.
