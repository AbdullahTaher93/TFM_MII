Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In a small bowl, stir together graham wafer crumbs, sugar, oil and cinnamon. Press onto bottom of prepared pan. Using a sieve, drain tofu. In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together drained tofu, eggs, sugar, cocoa, vanilla and salt until smooth. Pour into pan. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until firm. Let cool on a wire rack. Cut into 16 squares and garnish each piece with strawberry slice (if using).
