Heat the oil, if using, in a nonstick skillet, or one that has been sprayed with cooking spray, over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 4 minutes. Add the pepper and, if using, the mushroom slices and sauté for another 3 minutes. Lower the heat slightly. Sprinkle with the turmeric and paprika, then add the garlic. Sauté for an additional minute. Add the tofu, tossing to coat with the spices and to distribute the vegetables. Keep turning in the skillet until everything is nice and hot. Season as it suits you. Serve at once.
