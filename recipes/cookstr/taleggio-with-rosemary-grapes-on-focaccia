Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the grapes and rosemary and cook, stirring constantly, until the grapes begin to brown and one or two of the skins start to slip off, 4 to 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the grapes to a bowl. Wipe the skillet with a paper towel, but do not wash it. To assemble: Pull out some of the center of each piece of bread to create a well. Brush the outside of each piece with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Place the 4 bottom pieces on your work surface, oiled side down. Distribute the cheese evenly over the 4 pieces, followed by the grapes. Place the remaining 4 bread pieces on top, oiled side up. STOVETOP METHOD: Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Put the sandwiches in the skillet (in batches if necessary), cover, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bread has turned a shade darker and the cheese has begun to melt. Uncover, and turn the sandwiches with a spatula, pressing very firmly to compress them. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, or until the undersides are golden brown. Turn the sandwiches again, press with the spatula, and cook for 1 minute, or until the cheese has melted completely. Serve immediately. SANDWICH MAKER METHOD: Preheat the sandwich maker. Follow directions for sandwich assembly, and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions. GAS GRILL METHOD: Brush the grill rack with oil and preheat the grill to medium-high. Follow directions for sandwich assembly. Put the sandwiches on the grill and follow directions for the stovetop method.
