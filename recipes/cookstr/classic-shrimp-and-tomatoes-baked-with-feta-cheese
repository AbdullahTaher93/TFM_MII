Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. While the oven is heating, heat the oil in a large nonreactive flameproof casserole over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic and cook until slightly wilted, 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and cook until they soften, 5 minutes. Stir in the wine, Metaxa, tomato paste, 1 tablespoon of the dill, and the pepper. Cook briskly until the tomatoes are collapsing, 10 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring from time to time, until they begin to turn pink, about 2 minutes. Crumble the cheese in large chunks over the top and place the casserole in the oven. Bake until the cheese has melted, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon dill over the top and serve.
