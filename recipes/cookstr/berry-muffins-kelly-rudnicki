Preheat oven to 400Â°F, and spray a 12-cup muffin pan with dairy-free baking spray. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt with a wire whisk. In another medium bowl, combine the soy milk, vegetable oil or melted margarine, lemon zest, lemon juice, water, and vanilla with a spatula. Add the flour mixture to the soy milk mixture, and stir with a rubber spatula just until combined. Lightly fold in the berries with a rubber spatula. Divide the batter evenly among 12 prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle the tops with granulated sugar, and bake for 20 minutes, or until an inserted cake tester comes out clean.
