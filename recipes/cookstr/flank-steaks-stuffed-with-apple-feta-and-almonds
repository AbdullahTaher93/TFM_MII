Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Put the flank steak in a plastic ziplock bag with the honey and soy sauce and marinate overnight. In the morning, combine the feta cheese, garlic, green apple, and chopped almonds in a mixing bowl. Pour the flank steak and marinade into the stoneware. Remove the meat from the marinade, and put it on a cutting board. Put a handful or two of the cheese filling in the middle of the flank, and roll it up. Return the meat to the crock seam-side down. If you’d like to secure the meat with twine or skewers, go for it. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 7 hours, or on high for about 4 hours. Slice carefully, and serve. If the meat unrolls a bit, you can stick it back together with toothpicks to present nicely. Or don’t worry about it—it’s just going to get eaten anyway. If you are left with extra garlic, feta, apple, and almond mixture, it makes a great salad topping.
