Place the chicken breasts, chicken stock, thyme, marjoram, dried parsley, cumin, and chili powder in a soup pot or slow cooker. Simmer for at least 3 hours. (Don’t make the mole sauce until the chicken is cooked, because if it sits out for 3 hours, the sauce may dry out and lose flavor.) When the chicken is fully cooked and tender, cut into ¼-inch cubes. Make the mole sauce. Place all the sauce ingredients in a blender or food processor and mix until smooth. Pour the mole sauce in a sauce pot. Simmer on low heat to warm. (If cooking in a dorm room, drain the slow cooker and warm the sauce in it.) Add the chicken to the mole sauce and mix well. Serve over rice or with tortillas.
