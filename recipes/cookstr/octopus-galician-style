Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the octopus and bring back to a boil. Skim off the foam, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, and cook for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the octopus sit in the hot water for about an hour, or until tender. Drain the octopus and cut into bite-sized pieces with kitchen shears. Toss with olive oil, salt, and piment√≥n to taste, and serve.
