Preheat the oven to 350°. On a floured board, roll out half of the dough about ¼-inch thick. Fit it evenly into a 9-inch pie pan, pressing gently against the bottom and sides. In a bowl, toss the cherries with the sugar, tapioca, and lemon zest. Pour the mixture into the pie crust. Roll out the remaining dough and set the top crust in place. Trim the dough and crimp and seal the edges. Cut 3 small steam vents in the center of the pie crust.Brush the egg wash over the top. Bake the pie in the center of the oven for about 1 hour, until the crust is lightly browned. Let cool before cutting. Serve slightly warm.
