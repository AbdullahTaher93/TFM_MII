For the gazpacho vinaigrette: In a large bowl, combine all the diced vegetables and toss gently with the chopped dill. Add the sherry vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper. For the red snapper: Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Season the fillets to taste with salt and pepper. In a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until very hot and sear the fish, flesh-side down, until golden brown. Place the pan in the oven for 3 to 4 minutes, remove from the oven, and add the butter to the pan. Return to high heat on the stove top, turn the fillets, and cook until medium-rare, about 1 minute. Drain on paper towels. To serve: Toss the salad greens with Just enough sherry vinaigrette to moisten and divide among 6 plates, placing the greens off center. Place 1 red snapper fillet alongside each serving of greens. (Or, center the greens and place the fish on top.) Spoon 3 tablespoons of the gazpacho vinaigrette over or around each serving of fish. Serve immediately. Variation: Substitute Basil Vinaigrette for Sherry Vinaigrette, as a base for the gazpacho vinaigrette.
