Lightly salt the seafood and chill in the refrigerator until ready to cook. Arrange the seafood on a platter and garnish with the lemon wedges and cilantro sprigs. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the olive oil and saut√© the shallots, garlic, and ginger until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the wine, water, and salt and bring to a boil. Transfer to a fondue pot and bring the broth to a simmer. Skewer the seafood on fondue forks and cook until just no longer opaque, about 2 minutes. Dip into the sauces.
