Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly butter a shallow 2-quart baking dish, about 8 inches square or 11 × 7 inches. Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the flour and cook, stirring, over low heat for 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the milk; cook, stirring, until the milk boils and the sauce is slightly thickened. Remove from the heat. Add the salt and Tabasco sauce. Stir in the Cheddar. Taste and add more salt if needed. Spread the rice in the baking dish. Pour the cheese sauce over the top. Sprinkle with the mozzarella. Bake until the top is browned and bubbly, about 45 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting into squares and serving. Mushroom-and-Bacon Baked Rice and Cheese: Omit the Tabasco. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Add 1 slice bacon, diced, and cook, stirring, until lightly browned. Add 2 cups sliced cremini or white button mushrooms and ½ cup chopped onion. Cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble the casserole, spread half of the rice in the baking dish. Spoon the mushroom filling evenly over the top. Add the remaining rice in an even layer. Pour the cheese sauce on top. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and bake as directed.
