Heat the butter and oil in a medium sauté pan over medium heat until the butter melts. Sauté the shallots until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the wine and figs and simmer until the wine is absorbed and the figs are soft, about 8 minutes. Stir in the stock and simmer, covered, for about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest, covered, while you prepare the penne according to package directions. Drain and toss with the fig sauce. Serve the penne topped with the prosciutto, Parmesan, and a sprinkle of pistachio nuts and pink peppercorns.
