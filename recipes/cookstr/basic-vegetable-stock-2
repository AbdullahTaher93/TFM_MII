This basic stock is flavor rich with a golden hue. Include any trimmings from the vegetables youâ€™re using that are appropriate. Scrub the vegetables and chop them roughly into l-inch chunks. Heat the oil in a soup pot. Add the vegetables, yeast, garlic, and herbs and cook over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently. The more color they get, the richer the flavor of the stock. Add 2 teaspoons salt and 2 quarts cold water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Strain.
