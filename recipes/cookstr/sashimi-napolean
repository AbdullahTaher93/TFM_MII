Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, wasabi, and soy sauce until dissolved. Gradually whisk in the olive oil. Reserve. Fish: With a very sharp thin-bladed knife, very thinly slice the fish against the grain. When cutting the halibut, slice against the skin as you would smoked salmon. Reserve. Wontons: Cut the wonton skins crosswise in half, making 15 pieces. In a skillet, heat Â¼ cup of the clarified butter over moderate heat. Fry the wonton skins until golden on each side, adding more butter as needed. Remove and drain on paper towels. To assemble: Place a wonton skin on each of four plates. Layer the fish to fit the wonton skin, separating the fish with the wonton leaves and ending with a layer of fish layers (4 layers per plate, creating a Napoleon effect). Tuck a shiso leaf under the corner of each Napoleon. Drain and dry the radishes and scatter with the daikon, sprouts, and chives over the top. Sprinkle with the dressing and serve.
