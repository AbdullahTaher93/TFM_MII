For the pudding, generously butter a deep 1-quart ceramic or metal bowl. In a medium bowl, beat together the sugar, butter, milk, and egg with an electric mixer until light and frothy. Using a rubber spatula or whisk, blend in the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in the vanilla. Spread half of the blueberries in the bottom of a heatproof 2-pint bowl. Pour the batter over the berries and spread the remaining blueberries over the top. Place a folded kitchen towel or a rack in the bottom of a large saucepan. Place the bowl in the pot and add boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the bowl. Cover the pot and steam the pudding for about 1 hour, or until the pudding is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the covered kettle for 15 minutes and then unmold onto a platter or plate. Make the hard sauce. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in the vanilla and lemon juice. Set aside at room temperature until ready to serve on the warm pudding. When ready to serve, reheat the pudding in the steamer or in a microwave. Cut into wedges and serve with hard sauce on the side.
