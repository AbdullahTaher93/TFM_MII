Combine the wine, mustard seeds, Â½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, the bay leaves, and lemon half in a 4-quart pan. Add water to fill the pan three-fourths full. Heat to boiling. Add the shrimp and cook over high heat until opaque in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and cool. Combine the basil, dill, rosemary, tarragon, thyme, garlic, mustard, and lemon juice in a large bowl. Whisk in the oil and season to taste with salt, pepper, and additional red pepper flakes if desired. Stir in the red and yellow peppers and add the shrimp.
