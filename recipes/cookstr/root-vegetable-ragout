Thinly slice the onions. Peel and slice the carrots ¼ inch thick. Peel the turnips and potatoes and cut them into ¾-inch cubes. Heat the oil in a medium-size saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add the onions and sauté until they sizzle and begin to wilt, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and cook covered until the onions are soft and begin to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in the vegetables, saffron, white wine, broth, and raisins. Simmer covered over low heat until the potatoes are tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve hot.
