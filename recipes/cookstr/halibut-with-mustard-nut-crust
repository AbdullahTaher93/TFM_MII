Cream 3 tablespoons of the butter with the mustard and hazelnuts in a small bowl. Season the fish with salt and cayenne pepper and spread the butter mixture all over one side of each steak. Refrigerate for 1 hour if time allows. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Spread the remaining 1½ tablespoons butter in a shallow baking pan that will hold the fish without crowding. Place the fish in the pan, then top it with a couple of thyme sprigs. Pour the wine around the fish and scatter the olives around; strip the leaves from 4 sprigs of thyme and scatter them around as well. Bring to a boil on top of the stove, then transfer to the oven and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, undisturbed, until the fish is just about done; it should be firm and just about opaque nearly all the way through. Turn on the broiler and place the fish about 3 inches from the heat source. Broil for a minute or two, or until the crust is bubbly and light brown. Serve.
