Peel the pumpkin, remove seeds and stringy bits, and cut it in pieces. Put these in a pan with a tight-fitting lid with about ½ cup (125 ml) of water, and steam for 20–30 minutes, until soft. Then, if any water remains, cook with the lid off until the liquid disappears. Make a stiff béchamel sauce: melt the butter in a pan, add the flour, and stir vigorously for a few minutes, then add the milk gradually, stirring all the time to avoid lumps, and simmer for about 8 minutes. Mash the pumpkin to a puree with a fork. Add the rest of the ingredients (except the butter and flour for the pan) and beat. (You may blend everything together to a cream in a blender or food processor.) Taste to adjust the flavoring. This is all-important with pumpkins. They grow particularly sweet in the Veneto, and that is why you will probably need to add sugar to approximate the taste. Pour into a greased and floured, preferably nonstick, baking dish or mold (a ring mold or a round bomba will do very well) and bake at 350°F (180°C) for about 45 minutes. Turn out and serve hot.
