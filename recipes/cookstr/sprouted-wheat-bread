Place the yeast, water, honey, salt, sprouts and white flour in a dishpan or large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of the whole wheat flour, and continue to beat, adding more flour, a little at a time, until the dough is too stiff to beat. Add 1 more cup of whole wheat flour, then squeeze the mixture with your hands until the flour disappears. If it is too wet to pick up, add a little more flour. As soon as you can handle the dough, sprinkle with a bit more flour and begin to knead directly in the bowl (or on a floured board). Knead for about 10 minutes, or until the dough is easy to handle and feels springy, although somewhat sticky. Shape into a ball. Spread a little oil on the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add the ball of dough, then turn it over, oiled side up. Cover and set in a warm spot for about an hour, or until the dough doubles in bulk. Thoroughly grease (with oil or butter) two 9-x-5-inch bread pans and set aside. Punch down the risen dough, knead for a minute or so, and form into a ball. Cut in half, and pat each half into a flattened rectangle that is a little longer than the pans. Starting at one of the long sides, tightly roll up each rectangle. Pinch the seam together, turn the loaf over, and tuck the ends under neatly. Place seam-side down in the prepared pans, cover, and let rise about 30 minutes, or until the dough doubles in bulk. Place the pans in a preheated 350Â°F oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until the loaves are very brown and hollow-sounding when rapped on the bottom with your knuckle. Cool on a wire rack before serving.
