In a large bowl or in the bowl of an electric mixer, whisk together the whole wheat flour, cornmeal, and salt to evenly combine. Pour in the olive oil and Â¼ cup water and mix with the hook attachment until the dough comes together in a ball with a tacky consistency-dry, but neither too crumbly nor too stiff. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water if necessary to achieve this texture. Alternatively, the dough can be mixed with a spoon, then kneaded by hand on a surface lightly sprinkled with flour. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 3 days. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Divide the dough into 4 squares. Lightly sprinkle a flat surface with flour and roll each square out to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Use a knife to cut out crackers into 2-by-1-inch rectangles. Arrange the rectangles on baking sheets (it will be necessary to bake in batches) and bake until the crackers are crisp and the edges are dark brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Store the crackers in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
