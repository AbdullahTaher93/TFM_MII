Cook at low pressure (see Notes) for 4 minutes/all cooker types or for half the cooking time indicated on the pasta package. When the time is up, open the pressure cooker with the Normal Release method (see Notes). Sprinkle the mozzarella over the lasagna; stir, and let stand, uncovered, for 2 minutes before serving.

For example, if the pasta package says the shape needs 9 to 10 minutes of conventional boiling, it should be pressure cooked for 5 minutes at low pressure; 12 to 13 minutes would be 6 minutes at low pressure, and so on.
