Preheat your oven to 350Â°F. In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, oil and milk to form a rough damp dough. Tip out into a fluted tart pan 10 inches wide and around 2 inches deep, and press the dough patiently over the base and the sides of the pan, slightly coming up over the top if possible. Put in the freezer. Melt the syrup, butter and brown sugar over a lowish heat in a saucepan. Add the vanilla, stir, then take off the heat in a saucepan. Take the pastry-lined tart pan out of the freezer, and arrange the nuts on it. Whisk the eggs into the slightly cooled sugary syrup until it looks like a caramel mixture, then pour it over the nuts. Bake in the oven for 40 minutes, or until the filling has set and the pastry is golden.
