Heat the broth or water in a medium-large skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add the greens and sprinkle them very lightly with salt. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the greens wilt. (Check the level of broth or water after about 2 minutes, to be sure thereâ€™s enough liquid to prevent sticking or burning.) Transfer to a serving dish, and toss with the oil and cherries. Serve hot or warm, topped with the walnuts.
