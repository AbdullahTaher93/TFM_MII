Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) Press half of the dough into prepared pie plate (see Notes). Divide second piece of dough into 8 individual pieces and flatten into 3-inch (7.5 cm) circles. Set pieces aside on a piece of parchment paper. Alternatively, you can press or roll the second piece of dough into one solid circle to top pie. Place pie plate in refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes to chill while you prepare the filling. Filling: In a large bowl, gently combine apples, raspberries, sugar, flour, lemon juice and liqueur. Transfer filling to prepared bottom crust, mounding in center. Place pastry circles on top of fruit, slightly overlapping pieces to decoratively top pie. (The entire top will not be covered. You will see the fruit between circles.) Lightly lift edges of circles where they touch and brush with a dab of water to adhere together. With the point of a sharp knife, slash a few vents in top of pastry to allow steam to escape during baking. Lightly brush pastry with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Place pie plate on baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour and 20 minutes or until top is nicely browned and juices are bubbling and look thickened. If pie starts to get too brown before it’s finished baking, cover loosely with a piece of tented foil. Let cool on a wire rack for 1 hour before serving.
