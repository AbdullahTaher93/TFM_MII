If using fresh yuca, peel it. If using frozen yuca, do not thaw it. Cook the yuca in boiling salted water until tender. Do not let it get too soft, or it will become watery. Drain and mash. While the yuca is cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring a few times, until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ground beef, salt, and pepper and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon or fork, until the beef loses its pink color. Mix the beef with the yuca until well blended and shape into 8 patties, just like hamburgers. Dredge in the bread crumbs until evenly and completely covered. This recipe can be prepared to this point up to a day ahead. Just cover loosely with waxed paper and refrigerate until needed. To serve, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add enough oil to coat the bottom of the skillet and, when it is sizzling hot, add the patties 4 at a time. Fry on both sides until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Serve hot. To Serve: Serve with a tossed salad.
