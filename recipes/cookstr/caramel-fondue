In a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, melt sugar for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally at first, then constantly, until sugar is completely liquefied and browned. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and rum. In the top of a double boiler over hot (not boiling) water, combine milk, egg yolks and cornstarch mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes or until smooth. When sugar has caramelized, remove skillet from heat. Carefully stir in boiling water. (Mixture will bubble and spatter.) Immediately pour caramel into warm milk mixture in top of double boiler. Caramel will solidify again, but keep stirring over low heat for about 20 minutes until melted. Remove double boiler from heat; stir in vanilla. Transfer immediately to dessert fondue pot over candle flame. Spear a piece of fruit or cake with fondue fork and dip in fondue. Serve withâ€¦ Ladyfingers, chocolate cupcake pieces, apple wedges, nectarine wedges, marshmallows.
