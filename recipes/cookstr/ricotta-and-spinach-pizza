1) Put the oven rack on the lowest rung in the oven and preheat the oven to 450°F. If necessary, coat the pizza pan or baking sheet with nonstick spray. 2) Cook the spinach. Let cool and squeeze out as much moisture as possible, Combine: the ricotta; parsley, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. 3) Roll or stretch the dough into a 12-inch pie, or shape it to fit your pan. Place the dough on the baking sheet. Brush the dough with the olive oil. Top with the spinach, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and cheese mixture. The cheese will not spread like mozzarella, so drop small teaspoonfuls of the mixture on the pizza. Dust with the Parmesan. 4) Place the pizza on the bottom rack of the oven and reduce the temperature to 375°F. Bake for 25 minutes or longer, until the cheese is bubbly and the crust browns.
