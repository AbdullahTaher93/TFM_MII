In a small bowl, combine the chile, sugar, and salt. Cut the salmon into 2 pieces. Rinse, then pat dry with a paper towel. Rub the chile mixture evenly over the salmon. Sprinkle salt in a heavy, seasoned skillet (or an unseasoned skillet to which you have added the oil). Place over medium-high heat until hot. Saut√© the salmon for 3 to 5 minutes per side, until crisp and brown on the outside and still moist and bright pink on the inside. Serve on a pool of salsa.
