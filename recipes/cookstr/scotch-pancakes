Heat a griddle over medium heat. Place a folded clean kitchen towel on a baking sheet. Sift the flour and baking powder together into a bowl. Make a well in the center and add the milk, egg, and golden syrup. Whisk well until the batter is smooth and the consistency of thick cream. If the mixture is too thick, beat in a little more milk. To test the griddle, sprinkle a little flour on the surface; it should brown slowly. If it burns quickly, cool the pan. Carefully dust off the flour and lightly oil the griddle. Using a soup spoon, scoop out the batter, cleaning the back of the spoon on the edge of the bowl. Pour the batter from the tip of the spoon onto the hot pan to make a round shape. Repeat, leaving enough room between the pancakes for them to rise and spread. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface of the pancakes and they begin to burst. Carefully flip the pancakes with a metal spatula. Lightly press the spatula on each pancake to ensure even browning, and cook until the other sides are browned. Tuck the pancakes inside the folds of the towel to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, oiling the griddle before each batch. Serve immediately, while the pancakes are still warm.
