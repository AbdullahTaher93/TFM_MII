Halve the melons and seed them. Cut each half into 1/2-inch-wide strips and remove the rinds with a paring knife. Place the melon in a non-aluminum saucepan and add the cinnamon sticks, sugar, and lemon juice. Cover over moderate heat, stirring gently until all of the sugar melts, about 5 minutes. Add the curry powder and cook for another 5 minutes. Halve the melons and seed them. Cut each half into 1/2-inch-wide strips and remove the rinds with a paring knife.
