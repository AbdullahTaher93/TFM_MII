Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Putting them in a small roasting pan, arrange the cloves in a single layer and spoon the Chili and Garlic Oil over. Roast, stirring occasionally, until the cloves are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Watch the garlic as it browns-when it becomes too brown, it takes on a bitter taste. Cool the garlic and transfer it to a container and refrigerate, covered, until needed.
