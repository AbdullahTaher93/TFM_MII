PREHEAT THE OVEN to 425°F. Butter two 12-cup mini-muffin pans or thoroughly spray them with nonstick vegetable oil spray; set aside. IN A LARGE HEAVY SAUCEPAN, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Add the shallot and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened. Add the milk, water, and salt to the saucepan and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat and, when the liquid is simmering, gradually sprinkle the polenta over in a very slow, thin stream, whisking constantly in the same direction until no lumps remain. Reduce the heat to very low. Switch to a wooden paddle and stir every 1 or 2 minutes for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan and the grains of polenta have begun to soften. It will be quite a loose mixture. Remove from the heat and stir in the white pepper, egg yolks, Parmesan, and gorgonzola until thoroughly blended. IN A MIXING BOWL, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Stir a quarter of the whites thoroughly into the polenta mixture to lighten it, then gently fold in the remaining whites, taking care not to crush too much air out by overfolding. Spoon the mixture into a large piping bag fitted with a ½-inch plain tip. Pipe generous dollops into the muffin pans, finishing each with a point. The puffs should rise about ¼ inch above the surface of the pan. BAKE FOR 20 MINUTES, or until puffed and golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Run a small knife around the edges to release the puffs. Turn them out onto a warmed platter and serve immediately.
