Preheat oven to 350Â°F. To make the crust, stir together all ingredients and press into the bottom, and one inch up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap the bottom of the pan in aluminum foil to prevent leakage. Bake for 5 minutes. Remove and cool crust. To make the filling, beat the cream cheese and sugar in the food processor or mixer. Add the sour cream and mix well. Add the eggs one at a time and mix well. Add the Kahlua and vanilla. Pour filling into crust and bake 30 to 35 minutes. Remove cheesecake to a rack and run a knife around the edge to loosen and prevent cracking. Let stand for 5 minutes. For topping, stir the sour cream, sugar and Kahlua until smooth. Smooth gently over cheese and return to oven for 5 minutes. Let cheesecake cool completely on a rack and then refrigerate up to 24 hours. Cheesecake is always more flavorful if allowed to rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving.
