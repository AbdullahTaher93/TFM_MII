Set a sieve over a 2-cup glass measure and drain the cherries in to it. Mix the sugar with the cornstarch in a small pan and use a wire whisk to stir in 1 cup of cherry juice. Mix very well. Place the pan over moderate heat and simmer 3 minutes; stirring constantly. The sauce will thicken slightly and become lighter in color. Add the cherries and the kirsch or brandy **** Keep this mixture warm over very low heat while you spoon the ice cream into individual bowls. Bring the bowls to the table, then hold a lighted match over the pan of cherries. The liqueur will ignite. When the flame goes out use a metal serving spoon to ladle the cherries and the sauce over the ice cream.
