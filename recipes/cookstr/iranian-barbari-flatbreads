Soak the chia seeds in the 1/4 cup water for at least 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly dust with brown rice flour. In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown rice flour, tapioca flour, garbanzo bean flour, sorghum flour, almond meal, and salt. In a separate large mixing bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), dissolve the yeast in the room temperature water. Add the canola oil and Sucanat. Just as the yeast begins to foam and feed on the Sucanar, about 3 minutes, add the combined dry ingredients and the chia seeds with their soaking liquid. Mix thoroughly but just until the dough holds together. This will take just a few moments. You can do this by hand with a strong arm and a sturdy spoon, or with your stand mixer and the paddle attachment pulsed on low speed. Turn the dough out onto a work surface that has been generously dusted with brown rice flour. Divide into 2 portions. Gently place 1 portion on each sheet pan and using your clean, dry, and floured hands, press into oblong loaves with a scant Â¼-inch thickness. With the edge of your hand, make 3 ridges lengthwise on the surface of the dough. Brush the formed doughs with canola oil and sprinkle the sesame seeds on top. Bake for 25 minutes, until golden and firm. Serve warm. Or later, reheat the breads by wrapping them in aluminum foil and placing in a hot oven for 5 to 10 minutes.
