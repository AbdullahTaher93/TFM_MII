Marinate the fish. In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the chile pieces a few at a time, pressing them firmly against the hot surface with a metal spatula until they are aromatic, about 10 seconds per side. In a bowl, cover the chiles with hot tap water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes: place a plate on top to keep them submerged. Use a pair of tongs to transfer the rehydrated chiles to a food processor or blender. Add ½ cup of the soaking liquid, along with the tomato sauce, garlic, soy and Worcestershire. Blend to a smooth puree. Press through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. Taste and season highly with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. Cut ½-inch-deep diagonal slashes along the flesh side of the fish (to promote even cooking and aid in marinade penetration). Sprinkle both sides with salt. Spread or brush about 3 tablespoons of the marinade over both sides of the fish—spread some on the bones as well. (You’ll probably have marinade left over for another round of fish. It’ll keep for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator.) Grill the fish. Turn on a gas grill to medium or light a charcoal fire and let it burn until the coals are covered with white ash. Lay a grill basket over the fire. When the basket is quite hot, brush or spray it generously with oil. Spray or lightly brush the fish with oil, then lay the oiled side down on the basket: spray or brush the other side. Close the basket and lay it over the fire. Cook, turning every 3 or 4 minutes, until the fish is cooked through but still juicy—a 3-pound snapper typically takes 10 to 15 minutes. Gently and carefully open the basket and remove the fish to a platter. Serve with the red onion, lime and toasted chiles—and plenty of warm corn tortillas-for making very tasty soft tacos.
