Lightly oil a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the figs, cut-side down, for 4 minutes, or until browned. When the figs are browned, gently turn them and cook on the other side for 3â€“4 minutes. Remove the figs from the pan and place them in a shallow dish. Sprinkle with Gorgonzola, drizzle with honey, and serve immediately. Variation Savory Fig Salad: For a sweet and savory salad, delete the honey and serve the salad with thinly sliced proscuitto and ricotta.
