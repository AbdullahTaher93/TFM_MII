Whisk the mustard, honey, vinegar, and salt and pepper together in a small bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Continue whisking until the vinaigrette thickens. Refrigerate, covered, until 30 minutes before youâ€™re ready to use it. Let the vinaigrette come to room temperature before using.
