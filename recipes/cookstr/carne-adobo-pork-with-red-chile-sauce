Process all the ingredients except pork chops in a blender or food processor. Pour into a large flat-bottomed glass baking dish. Dip each pork chop into the marinade and lay to one side of the baking dish as you coat the rest. Let marinate 30 minutes at room temperature, periodically spooning chile mixture over the top and turning chops over. Then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. (The pork can be frozen for up to 3 months at this point.) In the morning, stir and coat each pork chop with chile sauce. Stir and coat again. Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Cover pan with lid or foil; bake chops, covered for the first 45 minutes. Remove cover and bake 1 to 1½ hours longer, spooning the sauce over chops every 30 minutes. Let cool. Using a sharp knife, remove bones and pull meat apart with your fingers to shred the pork. Place shredded meat back in the baking dish. Bake 30 minutes to allow the sauce to cook into meat. When done, the meat should be a bright rosy red color and very tender.
