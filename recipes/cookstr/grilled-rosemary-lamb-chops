TO MAKE THE MARINADE: In a small bowl, whisk together all the marinade ingredients. Rub the marinade on the chops, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight. TO PREPARE THE CHOPS: Prepare a fire and allow the coals to die down to a medium-hot temperature or preheat a gas grill to medium-high. Cook the chops for 6 to 7 minutes per side or until firm and resilient to the touch for medium, about 5 minutes per side for rare-pink. Make a slit into one of the chops to test for doneness to your liking, but take them off the grill while still slightly pink as they will continue to cook as they rest. Transfer them to a platter and serve with a rosemary sprig on top.
