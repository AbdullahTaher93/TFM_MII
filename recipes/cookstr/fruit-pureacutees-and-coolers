Place the fruit in a blender and process until smooth. To make a strawberry or mango cooler, place 3 tablespoons of the puree in a tall glass and top with 8 ounces of seltzer. For a sweeter drink simply add more puree. To make the nectarine cooler, top 3 tablespoon of puree with ½ cup of a range juice and ½ cup of seltzer. Stir and add some ice cubes. Finish all of the drinks with a squeeze of lemon or lime.
