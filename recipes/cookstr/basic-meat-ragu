Heat the pressure cooker base on medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter and the olive oil, and heat until the butter has melted. Add the onion, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper and sauté, stirring infrequently, until the onion has softened. Stir in the carrot and celery. Move the contents to the side in the pressure cooker. Add the beef and garlic and stir to break up. Sauté, stirring infrequently, until the beef is brown on at least one side and the juices have evaporated, for 5 minutes, or longer if there are a lot of juices. To deglaze the cooker, stir in the red wine and cook until it evaporates completely Pour in the chopped tomatoes and the tomato puree; add the water if using. Close and lock the lid of the pressure cooker. Cook at high pressure (see Notes) for 15 minutes/stovetop or 18 to 20 minutes/electric (or nonstandard stovetop). When the time is up, open the pressure cooker with the Normal Release method (see Notes). Fish out and discard the herb stems. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the sauce and stir until melted. Serve the sauce over pasta or incorporate in lasagna or a similar recipe.
