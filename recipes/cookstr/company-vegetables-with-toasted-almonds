In baking dish or platter, alternately arrange cauliflower and broccoli, with broccoli stalks toward the outside, around outer edge of dish. Mound pepper cubes in center. Add 1/3 cup (75 mL) water. Cover with lid or plastic wrap and turn back one corner to vent. Microwave on High for 6 to 9 minutes or until vegetables are tender-crisp. Let stand, covered, while preparing topping. Topping: In a small microwave-safe glass bowl, combine 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the butter and almonds. Microwave, uncovered, on High for 1 ½ to 3 minutes or until almonds are lightly toasted, stirring twice. (Can be done up to 4 hours ahead, if desired.) Just before serving, add remaining butter and garlic to toasted almonds. Microwave, uncovered, on High for 45 to 60 seconds or until fragrant. Stir in lemon juice. Carefully drain water from vegetables (a plate set on top will hold vegetables in place). Pour almond butter over top. Sprinkle with parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately. Variation: Substitute partially cooked carrots for the pepper cubes, if desired. To prepare, place 3 cups (750 mL) thinly sliced carrots and ¼ cup (50 mL) water in a casserole dish. Microwave, covered, on High for 2 to 4 minutes or until crisp. Drain and continue with recipe as directed.
