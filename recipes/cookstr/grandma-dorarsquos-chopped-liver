Immerse the livers in plenty of boiling water, cover, and boil gently until the livers are gray and firm, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain well. Chill in the refrigerator for 40 minutes. Using a sharp knife, chop the livers to a smooth paste. Using a wooden spoon, stir together half of the liver, onion, and eggs. Add the remaining liver, onion, and eggs and stir to combine completely. Add enough of the chicken fat to moisten and hold the liver together. Add the paprika. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
