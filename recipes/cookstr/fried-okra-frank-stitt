Place the okra in a bowl of ice water for 15 minutes to crisp; drain and pat dry. Combine the cornmeal, flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow pan. Transfer the okra to a large bowl and toss with the buttermilk. Lift the okra out with a slotted spoon and place in the pan of cornmeal, tossing it around to lightly coat. Transfer the okra to a rack set over a baking sheet. In a large deep cast-iron or other heavy skillet, heat Â¾ cup of the oil over high heat until almost smoking. Add just enough okra to cover the bottom of the skillet in a single layer, without crowding, lower the heat to medium, and cook until golden and crusty on the bottom, about 6 minutes. Turn and cook, tossing the okra once or twice, until well colored and crisp on all sides. With a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined sheet pan and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm in a low oven while you continue to cook the okra in batches, adding the remaining oil as needed. Dig in while the okra is warm!
