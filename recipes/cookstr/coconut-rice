Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant but not brown, about 1 minute. Add the rice and saut√© until the individual grains are shiny, about 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, water, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and cook the rice until all of the liquid is absorbed and the grains are tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the rice stand, covered, for 1 minute. Fluff with a fork and serve at once.
