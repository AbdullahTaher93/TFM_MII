Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). On the stove top, heat half the olive oil in an ovenproof saucepan, add the peas and spinach and cook, stirring all the time, for 2 minutes, until the spinach wilts. Add about ¼ c of the stock and puree in a blender or food processor. Set aside. In the same saucepan, heat the remaining olive oil, add the onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and sweat over a gentle heat until soft but not colored. Add the risotto rice and stir it around in the saucepan for a minute, then add the remaining stock and the wine. Stir and bring it up to the boil, cover with the lid and place in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is just cooked and all the liquid has been absorbed. Stir in the vegetable puree and set aside with the lid on. Bring a saucepan of water up to the boil, add a good pinch of salt and the asparagus. Boil for 2-3 minutes or until it is just tender, then drain. Serve the risotto in warm bowls with the asparagus and Parmesan arranged on top.
