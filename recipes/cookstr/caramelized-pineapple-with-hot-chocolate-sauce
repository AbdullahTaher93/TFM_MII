14 bamboo skewers soaked in cold water to stop them catching fire in the heat of the broiler or grill Preheat the broiler or grill. Cut the top and bottom off the pineapple and, working vertically, slice the skin off the fruit. Cut into quarters and then into about three pieces again lengthwise so that you have wedges of pineapple. Cut out the woody core and thread the wedges onto the soaked bamboo skewers lengthwise and arrange these in a shallow dish. Put the chocolate, broken up into pieces, into a thick-bottomed pan along with the Malibu and melt over a low heat. Then, stirring, pour in the cream, plus any juice that has gathered from the fruit. When the sauce is thick, smooth and hot, pour into a bowl with a ladle, or enough little bowls to give one per person. Lay the pineapple kebabs on a sheet of foil and either broil or grill the pineapple, thickly coating it with Demerara sugar first, until it caramelizes and scorches in the heat. Take from the broiler or grill and lay them on a large plate and let everyone take them as they want, dipping the pineapple skewers into the hot chocolate sauce as they eat.
