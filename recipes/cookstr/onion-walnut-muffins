Preheat the oven to 425Â°F and spray the muffin tins with nonstick spray. Peel the onion, cut it into quarters, and puree it fine in a food processor. Measure the puree and increase or decrease the amount to make 1 cup. Beat together the butter, eggs, and sugar and add the onion puree. Stir in the remaining ingredients in the order given and mix the batter thoroughly. Fill the muffin tins almost full. Bake the muffins 20 minutes, or until they are puffed and well browned. Serve warm.
