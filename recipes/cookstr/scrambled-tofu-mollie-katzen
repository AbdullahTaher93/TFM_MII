Cut open the box of tofu, and slide its contents into a medium-sized saucepan. Add water to cover, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes, then drain in a fine-mesh strainer. Transfer to a plate, and use a dinner knife to cut the tofu into pieces the size of large cottage cheese curds. Place an 8-inch nonstick crêpe or omelet pan over medium heat and wait several minutes. Spray it lightly with nonstick spray, and add a little olive oil or butter. Wait about 10 seconds, then swirl to coat the pan. Add the tofu pieces, salt, and a light sprinkling of pepper, and sauté over medium heat for about 8 minutes, or until the tofu is light golden brown. Transfer to a plate and serve right away. SCRAMBLED TOFU PLUS Like scrambled eggs, Scrambled Tofu can be expanded and augmented in many ways. You can add it to vegetables or dress it up with minced scallions, “veggie bacon”, guacamole, or salsa. Enjoy it on—or with—toast or wrapped in a warm flour tortilla.
