To make the soup, in a soup pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, potatoes, and broccoli, and sauté for another 5 minutes. Add milk and heavy cream, and bring to a gentle boil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat and simmer the soup for 15 minutes, until potatoes are soft. Add cheese and continue to simmer for 2 minutes. While soup is cooking, make the Pistachio-Crusted Bread. Rub cut sides of halved garlic cloves over each piece of bread. Top each piece with a handful of Parmesan cheese and pistachios. Toast until browned, either in toaster oven or under a broiler. If desired, serve bread with butter. Purée soup mixture in a blender or food processor. Serve hot with a sprinkling of walnuts and a small dollop of sour cream on top of each serving. Serve with Pistachio-Crusted Bread.
