Drain the chopped tomato in a colander, pressing down with a wooden spoon to squeeze out any excess water. In a large bowl, combine the chopped lettuce, cucumber, celery, onion, pimientos, capers, olives, and anchovies. Add the drained tomatoes. Using a sharp knife, give the mixture an extra chopping right in the bowl. Add the oil and mix thoroughly. Add the salt to taste, then the vinegar. Taste again. The salad should have a fairly lively flavor at this point. If not, carefully add a little more salt and season with the pepper.
