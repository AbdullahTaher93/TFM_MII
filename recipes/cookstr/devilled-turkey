Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan over a high heat. Add the turkey and cook, stirring often, about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer to a plate. Add the onion and stir-fry about 2 minutes, or until it is just beginning to color. Add the red and orange peppers and garlic and stir-fry about 3 minutes. Mix the orange juice, mustard, chutney, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, and chile together until well combined. Stir into the vegetables and return the turkey to the pan. Cook about 5 minutes or until piping hot and the turkey is opaque throughout. Serve hot. Variation: Devilled Chicken or Pork: Substitute strips of boneless and skinless chicken breast or pork tenderloin for the turkey.
