Roughly chop the basil leaves and place in a blender or a food processor. Add the tarragon, cilantro. fennel fronds. chives. parsley, lemon zest, oil, salt, and pepper. Process until smooth. You should have about 1 cup of pesto; it will have a somewhat loose, saucelike consistency. Place half the pesto in a large bowl, add the shrimp. and toss to coat thoroughly. Prepare a medium-hot grill. Grill the shrimp for 2 minutes; using tongs, turn and grill the other side for 2 more minutes. Transfer the cooked shrimp to a platter and drizzle with the remaining pesto. Serve warm or at room temperature skewered with toothpicks for easy handling.
