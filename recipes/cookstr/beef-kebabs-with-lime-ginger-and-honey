For the marinade, purèe the scallions, ginger, lime juice, soy sauce, honey, and oil. Place the beef pieces in a nonreactive bowl and add the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1–2 hours. For the avocado cream, process the avocado, cream cheese, scallions, and chile. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the broiler. Thread the beef cubes and cherry tomatoes onto wooden skewers. Cook the beef kebabs for about 3 minutes on each side, or until medium-rare. Season with salt and pepper and serve hot, with the avocado cream.
