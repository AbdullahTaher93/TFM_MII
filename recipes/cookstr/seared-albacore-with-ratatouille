To prepare the ratatouille, heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon each of the olive oil and vegetable oil. Add the eggplant and salt, and sauté for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the eggplant is lightly browned and soft. Transfer to a large bowl. Add another teaspoon each of the olive oil and vegetable oil, and sauté the zucchini in the same fashion. Add it to the eggplant. Repeat the process with the red pepper and onion. Stir the cooked vegetables together; add the thyme, parsley, oregano, and rosemary; and season to taste with pepper and more salt if necessary. To prepare the tuna, heat a large skillet over high heat. Season the albacore steaks with salt and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil to the skillet and, when it is hot, sear the tuna for exactly 2½ minutes on each side, for a juicy medium rare. Transfer the steaks to a platter and cover lightly with aluminum foil to keep warm. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and, when it is hot, sear the figs, cut side down, until they are brown, about 2 minutes. Flip them over, add the cherry tomatoes, and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the tomatoes are lightly charred. Transfer the figs and tomatoes to the platter with the steaks and place the skillet back over the heat to prepare the sauce. To prepare the sauce, add the wine to the warm skillet you cooked the albacore and figs in. Reduce the wine by half, about 5 minutes. Add the clam juice and balsamic vinegar and reduce to a light syrup, about 3 minutes more. Season to taste with salt and pepper as needed. To serve, on each of 4 plates, place an albacore steak with some figs and tomatoes and a heaping pile of ratatouille. Drizzle some of the pan sauce around the plate.
