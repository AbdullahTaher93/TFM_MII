Preheat the oven to 350°F. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place in a large, ovenproof sauté pan with the chicken stock and heat over medium heat just to a simmer. Place the pan in the oven and poach the salmon until the flesh is opaque, but still medium rare, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the fillets to a platter and cool to room temperature, or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve with Provençal Mustard on the side.
