METHOD Combine the cherries with the kirschwasser, sugar, and lemon and toss to combine. Set aside for at least 60 minutes to macerate. (Overnight is better.) In a ceramic or glass bowl, melt the chocolate in the microwave for 10- to 20-second increments, stirring in between, until it is completely melted. Slowly stir in the sweetened condensed milk, milk, cocoa powder, salt, and the strained juices from the macerating cherries. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until it reaches soft peak. Fold the cream gently into the chocolate base, then transfer half the mixture to a shallow freezable container. Sprinkle on half the cherries, cover with the remaining ice cream mixture, and finish by sprinkling on the remaining cherries. The ice cream will swirl itself when you scoop it. Cover with plastic wrap or waxed paper pressed directly on the surface of the ice cream, and place it in the freezer for 6 hours. Scoop and serve with a dollop of whipped cream, chocolate curls or shavings, fresh cherries, or a splash of kirschwasser.
