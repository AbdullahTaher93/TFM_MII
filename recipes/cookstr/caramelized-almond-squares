Preheat the oven to 350°F. Put the tapioca flour, rice flour, and sugar into a bowl, rub in the butter, add the vanilla extract and bind with the egg yolk. Press into the prepared pan, prick with a fork and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the oven and allow the pastry base to cool for a few minutes. Put all the ingredients for the topping except the cream, into a saucepan and cook over a low heat until the mixture is a pale straw color. Stir in the cream and cook for a few more seconds. Spread the mixture over the cooked base and return it to the oven until the topping is a deep golden color – anything from 8 to 20 minutes, depending on the length of time the original ingredients were cooked. Leave the biscuits to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before cutting into 2in squares. Remove from the tin and cool fully on a wire rack.
