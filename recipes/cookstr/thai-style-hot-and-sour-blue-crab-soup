SORT through the crab meat and remove any pieces of shell. COMBINE all the ingredients except the crab and cilantro and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt, more fish sauce (Thai dishes that taste under-salted often need fish sauce instead of salt), and/or more lime juice. The soup should have a distinct tang. Immediately before serving, bring the soup to a boil over high heat and stir in the crab meat and the cilantro. Leave the crab meat over the heat for just 1 minute more to heat through. Serve immediately in hot bowls.
