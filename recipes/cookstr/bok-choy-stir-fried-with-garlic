Trim away and discard the bottom inch or so at the base of the bok choy, along with any tired outer leaves and stalks. Quarter the bok choy lengthwise and then line up the spears. Cut crosswise into 2-inch lengths and transfer the pieces to a large bowl. Tumble to loosen up all the leaves and pieces; you should have around 6 cups. Heat a wok or a large deep skillet over high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the ginger garlic, and salt and toss well. Scatter in the bok choy and toss well until it is shiny and beginning to wilt less than 1 minute. Add the sugar and water and continue cooking, tossing now and then, until the leaves are vivid green and the stalks are tender but not limp. 1 to 2 minutes. Add a little more water if needed to prevent burning while cooking. Transfer to a serving plate and serve hot or warm.
