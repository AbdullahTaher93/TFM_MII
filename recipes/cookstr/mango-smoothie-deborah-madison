Peel the mango, then slice it right over the blender jar to catch all the juices. Once youâ€™ve cut off the big chunks of mango, just squeeze your hand over the whole thing to get off as much flesh and juice as possible. Add all the other ingredients to the blender and puree until smooth. Pour into 2 glasses and garnish with mint.
