Bring the stock to a steady boil. Season with salt and pepper. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions. Beat the eggs with the nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper. Add the parsley. Reduce the heat to low. Add the butter to the stock. Stir the simmering stock with a whisk so the stock swirls in a vortex. In a steady stream, add the eggs. Cook about 1 minute, until the egg strands look set. Do not let the stock return to a boil. Remove from the heat and let stand for 3 minutes. Serve hot.
