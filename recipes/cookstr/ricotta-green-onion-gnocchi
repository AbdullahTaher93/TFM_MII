Put the ricotta in a sieve and place over a bowl for 16 to 30 minutes to drain. Discard the liquid. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a medium bowl, combine the drained ricotta, egg, salt, pepper, green onions, and Asiago or Parmesan. Gradually add the flour, ¼ cup at a time, using your hands and blending just until the dough holds together. Remove 1 teaspoon of the dough and roll into a ball on a floured surface. Drop into the boiling water. If the piece falls apart, add more flour to the dough, 2 tablespoons at a time, until it will form a ball. Repeat the cooking test until the dough holds together and floats to the surface. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. On a generously floured board, using your hands, roll each section into a rope about 1 inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into 1-inch-long pieces and slightly indent with a fork. If you’re not using the gnocchi right away, cover them thoroughly with flour and store in the refrigerator or freezer. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water. Stir gently to prevent sticking. When the gnocchi float to the top, they are cooked. Remove with a slotted spoon to a serving bowl. Meanwhile, heat the sauce in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Top the gnocchi with the sauce.
