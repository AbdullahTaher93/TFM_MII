In a large soup pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, saffron and a pinch each of salt and pepper; cook for 5 minutes or until onion is softened. Stir in garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Do not allow garlic to brown. Stir in fish stock, wine, tomatoes and their juice. Increase heat and boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Add fish chunks; cook another 5 minutes, increasing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Add mussels and shrimp; cover and cook 2 minutes longer or until shellfish open and shrimp turns pink.(Discard any mussels or clams that do not open.) Stir in chopped parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Put a toast in the bottom of each bowl; ladle soup over and serve immediately.
