Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200°F to 220°F. Spoon the sour cream and 1 tablespoon of the horseradish into a smokeproof baking dish. Rub the onion slice with the oil. Place the sour cream and onion in the smoker side-by-side and cook for 30 to 40 minutes. The sour cream should be runny but not separated, and the onion well softened but not cooked through. While the sour cream and onion cook, fry the bacon in a small skillet. Drain the bacon. Stir the cheese into the sour cream until well combined. Chop the onion and crumble the bacon. Mix into the sour cream. Add as much of the remaining teaspoon of horseradish as desired. The smoked horseradish will mellow in flavor, and any added at the end creates a pleasantly pungent bite. Chill for at least 30 minutes for best flavor. Serve with potato chips or carrot sticks.
