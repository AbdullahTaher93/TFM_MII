FIRST Wrap the tofu slabs in paper towels or a cotton towel, and place a heavy weight such as a cast-iron skillet on top. Let stand for 30 minutes to press out the excess water, then, using a fork, mash the tofu until smooth in a large bowl. SECOND Shred the black mushroom caps by hand or mince them in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Blot the water chestnuts dry with paper towels and chop finely by hand or in the food processor. THIRD Put the tofu, black mushrooms, water chestnuts, carrots, and Seasonings in a bowl. Stir vigorously with a spoon or your hands to mix well. Add the egg yolks and 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and stir until smooth and sticky. Sprinkle in another tablespoon of cornstarch if the filling is too loose. FOURTH Place Â½ tablespoon of the filling in the center of each dumpling skin and moisten the edge with a finger dipped in water or a beaten egg. Fold over to form a half-moon shape. Press the edges together to enclose the filling and seal. Place the finished dumplings on a baking sheet that has been lightly dusted with cornstarch. FIFTH Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large pot and add a third of the dumplings. Once the water returns to a boil, cook for 3 to 4 minutes over medium-high heat. Remove from the water with a strainer and place the cooked dumplings on a serving platter. Cook the remaining dumplings in two more batches as directed. Serve with the Spicy Dipping Sauce.
