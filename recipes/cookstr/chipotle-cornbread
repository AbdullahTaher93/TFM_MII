Preheat the oven to 400°F. Spray a 10-inch cast-iron skillet with oil and dollop in the butter. Combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the eggs, milk, and puréed chipotle-adobo mix in a small bowl. Place the prepared skillet in the oven to heat up for a few minutes, allowing the butter to melt. Combine the cornmeal mixture and the egg mixture, stirring until everything is just mixed. Then pull the skillet from the oven and pour about half the melted butter from the skillet into the batter. Stir the butter in, and working quickly so the skillet remains almost smoking hot, transfer the batter into it. Put the whole shebang back in the oven and bake until it’s deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
