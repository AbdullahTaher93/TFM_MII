Preheat panini grill to high. Place rolls, cut side down, on a work surface and brush crusts with oil. Turn rolls over and spread with mustard. On bottom halves, evenly layer with chicken, spinach, blue cheese, apple and bacon. Cover with top halves and press gently to pack. Place sandwiches in grill, close the top plate and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately. Variations: If you happen to have a firm, ripe pear, use it in place of the apple. I also enjoy this sandwich with crumbled feta cheese instead of the blue cheese.
