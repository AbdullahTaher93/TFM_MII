Cut the baguette in half lengthways and lightly toast on both sides. Cut 2 tomatoes in half crosswise. Rub the tomato halves over the cut sides of the toasted baguettes, squeezing out the seeds and flesh onto the bread, and discarding the skins. Top with half the anchovy fillets. Thinly slice the remaining tomatoes. Arrange the tomatoes over the anchovies. Drizzle with olive oil on top, then sprinkle with the shallot and parsley. Season with the pepper. Top with the remaining anchovies. Cut into thick slices and serve at once.
