Place the mirin in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and reduce to 3 tablespoons. Set aside to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. When the mirin has cooled, whisk in the remaining ingredients until the salt is dissolved. Let the mixture sit for at least 2 hours to allow time for the lime zest to flavor the sauce. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve before serving.
