In a heavy skillet over high heat, melt the olive oil and butter together and quickly sear and brown the pork chops on both sides. Place in the slow cooker. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Quickly sauté the shallot in the pan and place in the slow cooker, along with the apple and turnip. Blend the apple juice with the mustard and pour into the crock. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 7 hours, until the meat is tender. Transfer the chops, apples, and turnips to a platter. Turn the cooker to HIGH and whisk in the crème fraîche. Add salt to taste and pour the sauce over the pork. Serve immediately.
