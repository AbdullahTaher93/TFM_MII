Heat the oil in a wide saucepan – big enough to take everything comfortably later – and add the onion and garlic. Cook on a high heat until golden brown. Turn the heat down, and add the can of tomatoes, ginger, chilli, salt, garam masala and a 1/3 cup chopped cilantro. Stir until the mixture becomes shiny, and then add the ground meat, breaking it up with a fork in the sauce. Add the frozen peas, stirring everything together for a few minutes, and then add the boiling water. Bring the pan to the boil and then turn it down to a very gentle simmer. Cook for about 20–30 minutes, by which time most of the water should have evaporated and the lamb will be tender and the peas cooked through. Squeeze in some lime juice to taste and sprinkle the remaining chopped cilantro over the finished dish, or into individual bowls as you serve. I love warmed thick flat breads with this – and most supermarkets sell naans or rotis now – but even without the added carb, just spooned straight into my mouth, this keema does the trick.
