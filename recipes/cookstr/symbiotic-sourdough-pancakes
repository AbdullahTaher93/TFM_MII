In a large bowl, combine the sourdough starter, flour, and milk or kefir until thoroughly mixed. Allow the mixture to sit on the counter, covered with a clean towel, for 8 hours, or preferably overnight. Punch down the dough, if it has risen, and mix in the salt, eggs, and any spices you wish to use until a batter is formed. Heat the olive or coconut oil in a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Meanwhile, fold the baking soda gently into the batter, which will begin to gently foam and rise. Let it bubble and foam a minute or two, then add the mashed banana. Pour 1/3 cup (80 ml) batter into the hot oil. When bubbles appear at the center of the pancake (about 4 minutes), flip it over and cook the remaining side for about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Repeat until all the batter is used. Serve with your favorite toppings. Yogurt, creme fraiche, maple syrup, or fermented jams and butters work well.
