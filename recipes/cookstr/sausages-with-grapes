Preheat grill or start barbecue. Grill sausages over medium-high heat until cooked through. In a skillet, heat olive oil. Add grapes and toss over medium heat until plumped and heated through, about 2 minutes.(Alternatively, pan-fry sausages in a little olive oil; remove after 15 minutes or when cooked, add grapes to pan and follow instructions above.)
