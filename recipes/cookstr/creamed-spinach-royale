Melt the butter. Add the onion and saut√© until it is translucent (3 to 5 minutes). Add the flour and nutmeg and stir to form a smooth paste. Cook for approximately 1 minute, then add the cream and Parmesan cheese, cooking for another 2 to 3 minutes, until you have a thick, cream sauce. Add the spinach to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the spinach is warmed through, then season to taste with more cheese or salt as you desire.
