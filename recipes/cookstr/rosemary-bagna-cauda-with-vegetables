In a metal fondue pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-low heat. Add the anchovies and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic softens and the anchovies dissolve into a paste, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining oil, rosemary, and chiles. Cook slowly just until the oil is warm, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the bagna cauda stand for 30 minutes. When ready to serve, reheat the bagna cauda over low heat until just warm. Transfer to a metal fondue pot and keep warm over a low flame. Serve with the dipping ingredients of your choice.
