Pour the oil into a medium saucepan. Add the garlic and red pepper. Cook over medium heat, turning the garlic once or twice until it is golden, about 5 minutes. Remove the garlic from the pan. Add the tomatoes and salt to taste. Cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce is thickened. Turn off the heat and stir in the basil. Serve hot. Can be made ahead and stored in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 2 months.
