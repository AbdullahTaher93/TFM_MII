Cook macaroni according to package directions. Drain and set aside. In a screw-top jar, combine flour with ½ cup of the nonfat milk to form a smooth paste. Set aside. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt margarine; add remaining milk, paprika, mustard, hot sauce, salt and pepper, stirring constantly. When milk is hot, gradually stir in reserved flour mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened and bubbly. Add cheddar cheese; stir until melted. Stir macaroni into cheese sauce. Transfer to a 2-quart casserole. Arrange tomato slices over top, pushing edges of each slice into macaroni. Bake, uncovered, at 350°F for 45 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.
