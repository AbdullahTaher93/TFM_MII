Off the heat, whisk the egg yolks in a non-aluminum saucepan until they become thick and lemony in color. Add the lemon juice and seasonings. Add the cold butter and place the saucepan over very low heat, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens and becomes creamy. Remove from the heat. Beat the mixture with the whisk, adding the melted butter in droplets. When the sauce begins to take on the thickness of heavy cream, start adding the butter in a steady stream. Taste for seasoning and hold, off the heat, on a warm corner of the stove.
