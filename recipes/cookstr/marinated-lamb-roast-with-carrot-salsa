Combine the marinade ingredients in a zippered plastic bag. Add the lamb and turn to coat. Chill for at least 4 and up to 24 hours. Whisk the olive oil, lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, and mint in a bowl. Add the carrots, red onion, and garlic and mix. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C). Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove the lamb from the marinade and add to the pan. Cook, turning, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a roasting pan and roast about 10 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the roast reads 130째F (55째C). Transfer to a carving board and let stand 10 minutes. Carve the lamb. Mix the sunflower seeds into the salsa and serve with the lamb.
