Put 2/3 cup of the flour and ¼ teaspoon of the salt in a mixing bowl and combine with your hands. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and mix well with your hands. Continue adding oil 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough holds together and forms a ball when you squeeze it; you should need about ¼ cup. Roll the dough into a 16-inch-long log. Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside. Put the sugar, the remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt in a mixing bowl and combine with your hands. Add the remaining oil and mix well with your hands. Add ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough holds together and forms a ball when you squeeze it; you should need about 3 tablespoons total. Roll the dough into a thick 16-inch-long log. Cut both logs into 1-inch pieces, so that you have 16 smaller pieces and 16 larger pieces. Roll a larger piece into a ball and flatten it into a ¼-inch-thick 3-inch disk. Put a smaller piece of dough in the center of the disk, fold the disk over to make a half-moon, and seal the edges tightly. Flatten the half-moon until it is ¼ inch thick, then roll out into a 1/8 inch-thick 4 × 8-inch rectangle. Starting from a short end, roll up the rectangle as you would a jelly roll, squeezing the dough firmly with each turn and then sealing the seam; you should end up with a 4-inch-long log. Cut the log in half into 2 cylinders. Turn one cylinder cut side up and flatten it into a ¼-inch-thick disk, then roll it into a 3-inch-thick 3-inch round. Repeat with the remaining dough, keeping the completed rounds covered with plastic wrap. Use immediately in Peanut Turnovers.
