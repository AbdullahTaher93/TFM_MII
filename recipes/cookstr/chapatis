Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and discard any bran left in the sieve. Make a well in the center. Add 3 tbsp cold water and mix. Stir in enough of the remaining water to make a soft dough. Knead the dough in the bowl until firm, elastic, and less sticky. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel, and let stand about 30 minutes until the dough is a little more firm and less sticky. Dust your hands with flour. Divide the dough into 8 balls. On an unfloured work surface, roll each ball into a round about 7in (18cm) in diameter. Heat an ungreased frying pan over medium-high heat until hot. One at a time, cook the chapatis for about 30 seconds on each side, until golden and speckled with brown patches. Transfer to a plate, brush with ghee, and cover with another towel to keep warm while cooking the remaining breads. Serve warm.
