Pour the peanut oil to a depth of at least 4 inches into a deep fryer or a heavy, 8-inch-deep stockpot and heat to 325°F. Make sure the pot is at least 8 inches deep to allow room for the oil to foam up without risk. Meanwhile, cut the potatoes lengthwise into ½-inch-thick slices. Then stack the slices and cut the stacks into ¼-inch-wide strips. Rinse the potato strips in a bowl of cold water, changing the water until it runs clear. Dry thoroughly with paper towels. Working in 2 batches, fry the potatoes for 2 minutes to cook them partially. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to paper towels to drain. Reheat the oil to 375°F. Again working in 2 batches, fry the potatoes until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Using the slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain briefly, then put the French fries in a large bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the Parmesan cheese, parsley, and lemon zest and toss to coat the fries evenly. Serve at once.
