Place the water in a 1-quart saucepan, and bring to boil over high heat. Stir in the couscous and cover. Remove from the heat, and allow to sit for 5 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Transfer the couscous to a large bowl, and chill for 5 minutes. Add the chickpeas, green pepper, olives, and onion to the couscous, and toss to mix. Set aside. Place the lemon juice and olive oil in a small dish, and stir to mix well. Add to the couscous mixture along with the oregano, black pepper, and feta cheese, if desired. Toss to mix well. Serve immediately, or cover and chill until ready to serve.
