To Make the Basic Pizza Crust: Sprinkle yeast over warm water in small bowl and let stand about minutes. Combine 2½ cups (303 g) flour, sugar, and salt in large bowl. Stir in yeast mixture and olive oil. Continue stirring until flour is absorbed. Stir in remaining flour until a soft dough is formed. Dough will be sticky to start with, but after kneading it becomes easer to handle. Place dough on well-floured surface and shape it into a ball. Place your fingers on top of dough ball, curled slightly, and pull dough toward you; then push it away, using palms of your hands. Turn dough ¼ turn and repeat. Knead dough 6 to 8 minutes or until it is smooth and elastic. To judge whether dough has been sufficiently kneaded, place it on work surface, pull both ends gently, and release. Dough should be elastic and spring back. Little blisters of air should be visible just under the surface. If dough is sticky, gradually add flour while kneading. Do not use more than 3 cups flour, total. Shape dough into a ball by pulling sides underneath forming a smooth top. Cover dough and let it rest while you assemble the toppings. Heat oven to 400°F (200°C) with rack in lower third. Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray and sprinkle with cornmeal. Lightly flour working surface. Divide pizza dough into 4 parts. Roll each part into an 8-inch circle. Spread ¼ cup (59 mL) pizza sauce over half of each circle. Spring ¼ cup (23 g) cheese over sauce. You can add about ½ cup (118 mL) additional “extras” to each calzone. Fold circles in half. Press edges together and pinch to seal. After I pinch the edges, I roll them and press again. Place on baking sheet and cut several slits into top of each calzone. Bake about 18 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly before serving.
