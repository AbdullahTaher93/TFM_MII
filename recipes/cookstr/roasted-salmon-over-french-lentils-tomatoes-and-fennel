Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Combine the oil, onion, fennel, tomatoes, marjoram, and thyme in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook, partially covered, stirring frequently, until the fennel is soft, about 15 minutes. Add the wine and cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes longer. Add the stock, bring to a simmer, and stir in the lentils and garlic. Cook until the lentils are tender and the mixture has thickened, about 30 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste and keep warm. Toss the salmon fillets with the olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Place the fillets on a foil-lined baking sheet and roast until the fish is medium, about 10 minutes. Spoon the lentils into large, shallow bowls and top with the roasted salmon. Serve with the lemon wedges.
