Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Whisk all the ingredients except the chicken breasts together and season with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Place the chicken breasts in a baking pan, skin side up, and brush half the amount of sauce on the skins. Bake for 20 minutes. Brush the remaining sauce on the skins and bake for 20 minutes more. To serve: with poultry shears or a very sharp knife, split the chicken breasts down the middle and serve one half of a breast per person.
