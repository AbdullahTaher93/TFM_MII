Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C) Mixer Method In a mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment, beat flour, sugar, baking powder and salt on low speed until blended, for 2 minutes. With mixer running, drop in chunks of butter, mixing until it resembles coarse crumbs. Set 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the beaten egg aside. Whisk together remaining egg, cream and vanilla. Pour over dry ingredients and, using a fork, stir just until dough starts to bind together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead in chocolate chips and pecans. Continue to knead dough just until it holds together, about 6 times. Shape into a ball and pat into a 10-inch (25 cm) circle. Place on prepared baking sheet. Using a pizza cutter, cut into 18 wedges. Do not separate wedges. Brush with reserved egg. Bake in preheated oven until light brown, 18 to 22 minutes. Serve warm. Food Processor Method In work bowl fitted with metal blade, process flour, sugar, baking powder and salt until combined, about 10 seconds. Add butter chunks around work bowl; pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 times. Set 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the beaten egg aside. With motor running, add remaining egg, cream and vanilla through feed tube and process just until mixture starts to gather. If dough is tacky, refrigerate for 5 minutes. Proceed with Step 2 above.
