1 In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, ¼ teaspoon of the salt, ½ teaspoon of the pepper, and the chopped olives. Toss to mix. Set aside. 2 In another bowl, combine the eggs with the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Beat lightly just until blended. 3 In a 12-inch skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. When it foams, add the eggs and stir until they begin to thicken, just a few seconds. Reduce the heat to low. As the eggs set along the edges, lift them with a spatula and tip the pan to let the uncooked egg run underneath. Continue to cook until the eggs are just set, 30 to 40 seconds. The timing will depend upon whether a slightly runny or a firm omelet is preferred. The bottom should be lightly golden. 4 Dot one-half of the omelet with the cheese, then add the tomato and olive mixture. Slip a spatula under the uncoated half and flip the uncovered half over the covered half. Cook until the cheese starts to melt, 30 to 40 seconds longer. Slide the omelet onto a warmed platter. 5 Cut into serving portions, garnish with whole olives, and serve immediately.
