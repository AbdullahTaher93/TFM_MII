Bring the water to a boil over high heat in a large saucepan. Add the rice and stir gently so that it doesnâ€™t stick to the bottom of the pan. Return to a boil, turn the heat down so that the water simmers Vigorously, and cook, partially covered, 8 minutes. Drain the rice, return to the pan, and let stand, covered, until ready to serve.
