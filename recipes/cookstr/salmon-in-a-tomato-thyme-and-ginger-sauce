Cut the salmon into 2-inch pieces. Rub with the turmeric and half the salt. Set aside. Heat the oil in a skillet. Add the mustard seeds and when they crackle add the curry leaves if using. Add the onion, ginger, and green Serrano chilies and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the tomatoes, the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and the thyme and cook on low heat until the tomatoes are nice and soft and pulpy. Stir in the basil and vinegar and gently add the salmon. Poach the salmon on low heat for 7 minutes. Do not overcook, it is important for the salmon to be just moist but not dried out. Garnish with the cilantro and serve over rice, if desired.
