Preheat the oven to 375° F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 13 × 9 × 2-inch gratin dish. Then, scatter the minced garlic over the bottom. Make a single layer of potato slices in the dish, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with a few tablespoons of cheese. Repeat the layers until all the potatoes are used. Whisk together the egg, milk, and cream; pour this mixture over the potatoes. Sprinkle all the remaining cheese on top. Bake until the potatoes are tender and the top is bubbling and golden brown, about 1 hour. Serve piping hot.
