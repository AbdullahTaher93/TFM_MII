Beat the whites until stiff and set aside. Put the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and let it run for 4 seconds. Add the instant espresso and process for 3 seconds, then pour the cream through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream. Transfer to a large bowl. Fold in the egg whites and turn the mixture into a 3-cup loaf pan. Put into the freezer. Stir the mixture every hour for about 3 hours, or until solid. When ready to serve, invert onto a plate. Cut into slices and serve with sweet biscuits.
