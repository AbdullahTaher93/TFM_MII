In a small saucepan, combine the chiles, garlic cloves, sugar, salt, and white vinegar. Cover and heat gently, as if to steep, on very low heat for 30 minutes. Combine 1?4 cup hot water and the xanthan gum in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add the xanthan mixture to the chile mixture. Return to the heat and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Boil 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a blender (removing the center piece of the lid, and covering the opening with a towel—so you don’t injure yourself or those anywhere near you) or food processor (using a towel to cover the opening is also likely a wise idea) and blend until silky smooth, adding a touch more hot water if necessary. Store in an airtight container, chilled. It rarely lasts longer than a few days in my fridge, but it will stay fresh-tasting for a week to ten days as long as you keep it sealed well.
