Preheat the oven to 400°F. Spread the beef bones and calf’s foot in a baking pan just large enough to hold the meat in a single layer. Bake until the meats are very brown, 1½ hours. Turn the pieces occasionally and drain the rendered fat as necessary. Heat the oil in a large pot. Add the onions, leeks, carrots, and parsnips and cook over high heat, stirring often, until well browned, about 25 minutes. Add the browned bones and calf’s foot to the vegetables, along with the remaining ingredients. Pour 1 cup water into the pan in which the meats were browned and set over high heat. Stir and scrape up any caramelized particles from the bottom and sides. Pour the liquid into the pot. Add additional water to cover the ingredients by 2 inches, and set the pot over medium heat. When the stock reaches a boil, skim, reduce the heat so the liquid simmers, partially cover, and simmer for 4 hours. Skim occasionally. Strain out and discard the solids. Refrigerate the stock, or chill and then freeze. Before using the refrigerated stock or freezing chilled stock, remove any fat that has solidified on top.
