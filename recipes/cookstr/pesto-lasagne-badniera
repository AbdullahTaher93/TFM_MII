To make the pesto, place the garlic and pine nuts in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Add the basil leaves, salt, and pepper and blend thoroughly to a paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. With the machine running, slowly pour the olive oil through the feed tube and process until well blended. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the Parmesan. To prepare the lasagna, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package directions. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Crumble the firm tofu into a large bowl. Add the soft tofu and pesto, and mix until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon a layer of the pasta sauce into the bottom of a 9 × 13-inch baking dish. Top with a layer of noodles. Spread half of the tofu mixture evenly over the noodles. Repeat with another layer of noodles, sauce, and the remaining tofu mixture. Finish with a final layer of noodles and sauce, and top with the mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Uncover and bake for 10 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting. Garnish with parsley and serve.
