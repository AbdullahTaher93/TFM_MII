To Make the Green Goddess Dipping Sauce: Place the herbs, salt, garlic, lemon juice, anchovy paste, and mustard in a blender; puree until smooth. With the blender on low, slowly add the olive oil. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl, and stir in the sour cream until well combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. To Make the Roasted Poblano and Crab Hush Puppies: On an open flame of a gas burner, on a barbecue, or on a baking sheet under the broiler, roast the pepper until charred on that side. Rotate until charred all over. Transfer with tongs to a brown paper bag and close. Let the pepper steam for 5 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel, seed, stem, and finely chop. Meanwhile, combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, pepper, baking powder, and baking soda and mix well. In a separate bowl combine the eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, poblano pepper, green onion, and crab (or shrimp). Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until combined. Do not overmix. Over medium heat, place your ebelskiver pan on the burner and allow to warm up. Add 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil to each well. Once hot, add heaping tablespoons of the batter to each well. Cook until they are golden and release easily, about 4 minutes, then flip with a skewer or fork. Cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, then plop all of them out onto a platter. Your guests will gobble them up as quickly as you make them. Continue until you have used up all the batter. Serve with Green Goddess Dipping Sauce. You can also freeze the cooked hush puppies and thaw when needed, then reheat in the ebelskiver pan.
