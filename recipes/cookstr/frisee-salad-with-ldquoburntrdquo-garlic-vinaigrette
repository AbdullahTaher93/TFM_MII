Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook until warmed through but not browned, about 1 minute per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chorizo to a plate lined with a paper towel. heat the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until deep-brown but not burnt, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and, using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to another plate lined with a paper towel. Stir the vinegar into the skillet (stand back, as the oil might splatter) and season the dressing with salt and pepper to taste. Place the fris√©e and chorizo in a mixing bowl and lightly season them with salt and pepper. Add the dressing, toss to coat evenly, and transfer the salad to a large serving platter. Scatter the garlic over the salad and serve at once.
