Place the bread slices over a charcoal fire or under a heated broiler until they’re dark golden brown on both sides. (Work in batches; see Cook’s Note below.) Cut the tomatoes in half crosswise and, using half a tomato for each slice of toast, rub the tomato into the toast (on one side only). As you rub, let the tomato collapse into a thin red layer of flesh and seeds and juice, completely covering the surface of each slice. Discard any remaining tomato pulp, or reserve for another use. Drizzle each slice with a bit of olive oil, sprinkle with a few grains of salt, and serve.
