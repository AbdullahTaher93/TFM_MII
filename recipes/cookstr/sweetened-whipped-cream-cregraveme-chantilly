Freeze the mixer bowl and whip for 5 minutes. Place whipping cream in the chilled mixer bowl and attach the whip and mixer bowl to the mixer. Set to speed 6 and beat until cream begins to thicken. Increase to speed 8 and beat in sugar and vanilla until cream is your desired texture: either softly billowing or firm enough to pipe in a pastry bag. (It takes about 20 seconds to beat from soft to firm, so watch carefully.) Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Use as a garnish.
