To make the chicken: In a large mug, combine the oil, onion, celery, carrot, and thyme. Microwave for 1 to 2 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Add the chicken, salt, pepper, parsley, and enough water to cover. Microwave for another 1 to 2 minutes until heated through. To make the dumpling: In a second mug, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter and cut it in with a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add in the milk and stir just until combined. Dollop the dough into the chicken soup mug, and microwave for 30 to 60 seconds until risen and firm.
