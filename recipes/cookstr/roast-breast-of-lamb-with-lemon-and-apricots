Preheat the oven to 400°F. First, make the stuffing. Melt the butter in a small pan, add the shallots and garlic, and cook gently until soft but not colored. Mix the bread crumbs with the apricots, lemon zest, thyme, shallot mixture, and plenty of salt and pepper. Stir in enough egg to bind the mixture lightly. Lay the breasts of lamb flat on a board and season well. Divide the stuffing between them and spread it evenly, leaving a little space at the edges and at each end. Roll the breasts up tightly, starting at a pointed end, and tie each one in 3 or 4 places with string. Place the two lamb rolls side by side in a roasting pan. Put into the oven and cook for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn the temperature down to 300°F. Lift the lamb rolls out onto a board. Scatter the fennel, onions, and lemon wedges in the roasting pan, turn in the oily pan juices, and season with salt and pepper. Place the lamb rolls on top and return to the oven. Cook for about 1½ hours, turning the fennel, onions, and lemons occasionally, until both meat and vegetables are tender. Check from time to time and sprinkle the vegetables with a little white wine or water if they appear a little dry. If everything seems to be browning too quickly, cover the whole dish with foil. Transfer the lamb to a warm serving plate and let rest in a warm place for about 15 minutes. Cut the lamb into thick slices and arrange on warm plates with the roasted vegetables and lemons. Spoon over any juices from the roasting pan (they’ll be fatty, but tasty). Serve with rice or couscous.
