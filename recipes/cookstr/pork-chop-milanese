Clean the mushrooms with a damp paper towel and cut off the tip of the stems. Slice the mushrooms very thin and put in a bowl. Add the herbs, tomatoes, lemon juice, and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set the salad aside. Sprinkle each pork chop on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour, shaking off the excess. Dip each chop into the eggwash, letting any excess drip off, then dredge in the bread crumbs. Pour enough canola or peanut oil into a large skillet to measure ½ inch. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot. (To test the temperature, drop a piece of bread into the oil. When it sizzles, remove it—the oil is hot enough to use.) Lay the pork chops in the pan one at a time and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 2½ minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Add the arugula or mixed lettuce to the mushroom salad and toss. Arrange each pork chop on a dinner plate and top with a generous helping of the salad. If using, shave the truffle into thin slices. Scatter the truffle slices over each plate and serve.
