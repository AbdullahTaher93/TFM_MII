Combine the cumin, coriander, and peppercorns in a small frying pan and toast over medium heat until the seeds begin to brown and become fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Grind to a powder in a spice grinder and set aside. Whisk the yogurt in a bowl until smooth and lightened. Add the cucumber, onion, tomato, chiles, and mint and stir to mix well. Stir in the ground spices and the cayenne. Chill well. Stir in the salt just before serving and sprinkle with the chopped cilantro.
