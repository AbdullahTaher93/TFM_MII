In a blender or food processor, combine the nuts, 2 tablespoons cilantro, the oil, garlic, soy sauce, sugar, red pepper flakes, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons water. Blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. Season the pork all over with salt and pepper. Smear on enough cashew mixture to coat the pieces thoroughly (use about half of the mixture), and reserve the remaining cashew sauce. Let the pork marinate at room temperature while you preheat the broiler. Or refrigerate for up to 12 hours before cooking. Preheat the broiler. Thread the pork and pineapple chunks onto metal skewers, alternating the two. Broil the skewers, turning once, until the pork is singed in parts and the center is cooked through, about 12 minutes. Sprinkle the pork skewers with the remaining 4 tablespoons cilantro and serve with lemon wedges and the remaining cashew sauce.
