Preheat your oven to 400°. Arrange the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet or a cast-iron skillet. Toast in the oven for about 6 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant, giving them a stir halfway through. Remove and set aside. Combine the diced apples, the brown sugar, and the cornstarch in a medium bowl. Toss to coat evenly. Now add the salt, the lemon zest, and the lemon juice. Toss again. Using a paper towel, rub an 11 x 7-inch baking dish with a tablespoon of butter. Pour in the apple mixture. Roast the apples at 400° for 30 minutes or until tender, folding every few minutes. Remove the apples from the oven and preheat the broiler. Combine 1 tablespoon of the butter and the honey in a small saucepan. Melt and stir until incorporated. (Or microwave on HIGH 1 minute until the butter melts and the mixture bubbles.) Brush the bread on all sides with the honey butter. Place the sugar in a shallow dish. Dredge the buttered bread in sugar. Place the bread slices on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Broil 3 minutes, turn, and broil 2 minutes more, until evenly toasted and glistening. To serve, smear a tablespoon of crème fraîche on each piece of toast. Top with roasted apples and walnuts. Tell them it took you forever, and that it's too long a recipe to even discuss.
