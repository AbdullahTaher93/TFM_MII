Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Oil a baking dish just large enough to hold the peppers upright. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. In a large skillet, cook the garlic in the oil over medium heat for 1 minute until softened. Stir in the tomatoes and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the anchovies, capers, olives, and salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile, cut the tops off the peppers and set them aside. With a small sharp knife, remove and discard the seeds and the white membranes from the insides. Add the pasta to the boiling water, stir, and cook, stirring frequently, until al dente. Drain well, then stir the pasta into the tomato sauce. Fill each pepper about three-quarters full with the pasta mixture. Place the tops on them and arrange them in the baking dish. Pour the water around them. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the peppers are tender when pierced with a fork. Serve warm.
