Grill the chile over very hot coals or in a flame on top of the stove until blackened, about 10 minutes. Place in a paper bag and let steam for 10 to 15 minutes. Peel off the charred skin using your fingers or a sharp paring knife. Remove the seeds and coarsely chop the chile. Set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the blossoms, zucchini, corn, and peppers. Lower the heat to medium-high and sauté several minutes until the vegetables are soft, then add the chicken stock. Cook several minutes more over medium-high heat until all the liquid is absorbed. Let cool to warm. To assemble the quesadilla, spread ½ cup of filling on one half side of a tortilla, keeping the filling within ¼ inch from the edge. Sprinkle with some of the cheese. Fold the other half over to dose. Lightly brush the folded tortilla with a little oil. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Place quesadillas on a lightly oiled grill or grilling rack and cook, covered, over medium heat, about 45 seconds per side, just until the cheese has melted and the tortilla is lightly browned. To serve, cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges with a sharp knife or pizza cutter. Accompany with Guacamole and Pico de Gallo or your favorite spicy salsa.
