Preheat oven to 350Â°F. For glaze, in a small saucepan combine the soy sauce and ginger. Bring to a simmer. Stir in the honey until combined. Remove saucepan from heat. Drizzle oil in an ovenproof nonstick skillet Large enough to hold all the salmon, and swirl it around until the oil coats the entire surface. Heat over high heat until hot. Reduce heat to medium. Add the salmon fillets to the hot skillet. Cook until the fish turns pink and opaque halfway up from the bottom. (The bottom of the fillets should be browning.) Remove skillet from heat. Turn fillets over and brush with glaze. Transfer skillet to oven. Bake until firm, about 5 minutes.
