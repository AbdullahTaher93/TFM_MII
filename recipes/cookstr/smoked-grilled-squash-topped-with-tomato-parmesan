Heat grill or grill pan over medium-high heat; grill squash until grill marks form, about 1 minute per side. Combine the tomatoes, cheese, oil, onion, basil, chives, salt and ground red pepper in a small bowl; spoon mixture onto grilled squash. Place squash on a rack in a stove-top smoker; smoke over low heat until squash is just tender, about 10 minutes.
