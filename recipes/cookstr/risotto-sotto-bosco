Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, porcinis, and herbs and cook, stirring occasionally, until just softened and beginning to turn golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and cook until it turns opaque and starts to make a faint popping sound, just a minute or two. Add the white wine to the pot and cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Add a pinch of salt and 1 cup of the boiling water and cook, stirring continuously, until the water has nearly evaporated. Repeat the process with a second cup of the boiling water, and when that has nearly evaporated, add a third cup. You will know when to add more water when the surface of the rice is coated with small bubbles-it’s not unlike knowing when to flip a pancake. Cook, stirring, until this last addition of water has nearly evaporated. Test the rice by tasting it-it should be just cooked through, but still have a bit of a bite. If it’s too undercooked, add ¼ cup of water. Depending on the cooking temperature and the type and age of the rice, it may or may not need it. Trust your instincts. When the rice is just cooked through, about 20 minutes of cooking altogether, turn off the heat and vigorously mix in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter along with the cheese. Fold in the berries, and season the risotto to taste with salt. Serve immediately, with an extra dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano on each portion. On Tending to Your Pots In order to be a good cook, it helps to be observant, patient, and in charge. To tend to the pots and ovens, don’t be afraid to lean over, to stir whatever’s in there, to spread it out and see what’s happening. Most beginning cooks tend to be intimidated by everything happening on the stove-it helps to remember you are in charge of the food and not the other way around.
