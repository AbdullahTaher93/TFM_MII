Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a small saucepan, heat the oil, cayenne, and cumin until just warm. In a large bowl, mix the nuts and the spicy oil, tossing until the nuts are evenly coated. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and salt. Add it to the nuts and toss to mix well. Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and bake them for 18 to 20 minutes, until golden brown, stirring them once or twice. Remove the nuts from the oven and allow them to cool to room temperature. Store the nuts in a resealable plastic bag or a plastic container with a tight lid; they’ll keep for 2 to 3 weeks.
