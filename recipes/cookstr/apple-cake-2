Place an oven rack in position C (second position from the top) and preheat the oven to 275°F. Prepare the Bundt pan (see Notes) and set aside. Assemble the ingredients via the Creaming Method, folding in the apples and pecans last. The Creaming Method: Scale or measure all ingredients. Fats should be pliable but solid (no sign of melting). If kitchen temp is over 70°F, chill the mixing bowl. Combine all Dry Goods (except sugar) by pulsing in food processor. In a small bowl, beat eggs together along with any extracts. Using a stand mixer, with the paddle attachment, on medium speed, mix the fat(s) alone for a minute to spread them around the bowl. Add sugar(s) slowly and beat until mixture lightens noticeably in texture and increases slightly in volume. Reduce the speed to “stir” and add the eggs very slowly, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Work in the Dry Goods in three installments alternating with any additional liquids, such as milk. Always start with the dry ingredients and finish with the wet for a smoother batter. Stir in any bits and/or pieces (chocolate chips, nuts, etc.). Pour the batter into the Bundt pan and bake until the internal temperature reaches 212°F, about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Cool in pan for 15 minutes, then remove to rack to cool completely. Wrapped tightly, this will keep for 5 days.
