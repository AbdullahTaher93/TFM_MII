Place the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Place the salmon in a lightly oiled flameproof roasting pan that is large enough for the fish to be flat. Rub the top side of the salmon with the remaining oil, herbs, salt, and pepper. Roast the salmon for 8 minutes. Place the ramps on both sides of the salmon and turn them to coat lightly with oil. Continue roasting until the thickest part of the salmon is springy to the touch, about 8 minutes more. (The thinner tail end will be flaky and fully cooked, the thicker end will be cooked to medium.) Using 2 large spatulas, transfer the salmon and ramps to a serving platter, placing the ramps on top of the salmon. Cover with aluminum foil. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the pan drippings. Add the mushrooms to the pan. Return to the oven for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. Remove and place on the stove top. Add the greens, tomato, and wine and cook over medium heat. Stir until the greens are wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the enoki. Surround the salmon with the mushroom mix. To serve, arrange some of the greens on each plate and top them with the salmon and ramps.
