Put all ingredients except the salt in a large (about 8-quart) stockpot. Bring to a boil over medium heat, skimming any foam that rises to the surface. Adjust the heat to a strong simmer and cook, partially covered, 1 hour. Skim the foam that rises to the surface once or twice as the stock cooks. Strain the stock through a fine sieve and cool to room temperature. The stock can be refrigerated up to 4 days or frozen up to 3 months.
