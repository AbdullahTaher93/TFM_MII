Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Cake: In a medium bowl, mix together flour, coconut, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. In a large bowl, beat together sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla. Beat in pineapple with juice and carrots. Add flour mixture, beating just until smooth. Stir in chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan, smoothing top. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until a tester inserted into center comes out clean. Let cool in pan or transfer to a rack to let cool completely (see Notes). Cream Cheese Icing: While cake is cooling, in a bowl and using electric mixer, beat together cream cheese and butter until smooth and fluffy. Add confectioner’s sugar and vanilla, beating until smooth. Spread over cool cake and refrigerate until ready to serve. Variation: Decorate the cream cheese icing with shaved chocolate (use a vegetable peeler and a chunk of semisweet chocolate).
