Two days before serving, cut all the veggies (except the ginger) to a matchstick size or julienne. The goal is ¼ × ¼ by 2-inches. (Be careful when you seed and chop the hot pepper, and keep your hands away from your face the oil from it can burn your eyes.) In a large bowl, sprinkle the veggies with the salt and toss to coat them thoroughly. Place the salted veggies in a colander or large strainer and let them stand and drain at room temperature for about 3 hours. Rinse the veggies, and place in a large glass container. Add the sugar, ginger, and the vinegar. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 2 days before using. Stir thoroughly after the first day.
