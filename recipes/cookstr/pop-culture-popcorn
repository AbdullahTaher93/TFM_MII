Select one of the flavoring mixtures and have all the ingredients for it assembled before you begin to pop the corn. Then, to pop the corn, combine the unpopped kernels and the oil in a heavy 4-quart saucepan. If you will be using a savory flavoring, use olive oil, and if you will be using the chocolate and orange zest flavoring, use vegetable oil. Place the pan over medium-high heat and when the kernels start to pop, cover tightly and continue to cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until all the kernels pop, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the popcorn into a large bowl, and then make the flavoring.
