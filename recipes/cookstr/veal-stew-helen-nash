Preheat broiler and line a broiler pan with foil. Place peppers, skin side up on the broiler pan. Broil close to the heat source (4 inches, approx) until skin is blistered and charred, (6-7 minutes). Wrap the peppers in the existing foil and cool. The heat will loosen the skin. Peel the peppers and cut into 1 inch cubes. Set aside. Preheat oven to 375 F. In a large heavy skillet heat the oil over medium heat. Pat veal pieces dry and dredge lightly in flour, shaking off any excess. Saute several pieces of meat at a time, over medium heat until browned. As the pieces brown, transfer them to a 4-quart heavy bottomed saucepan with a tight fitting cover, or Dutch oven. Then, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Add remaining ingredients to pan. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, remove from heat and place in oven. Cook for 1 hour, or until meat is soft, but not falling apart. Adjust seasoning.
