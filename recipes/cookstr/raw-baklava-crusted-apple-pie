To Make the Syrup: Mix everything together in a large bowl or mason jar. Ideally you should make this the night before, but let it sit for at least 4 hours before serving so the flavors have time to get to know each other. To Make the Crust: Whiz together the nuts, cinnamon, cloves, salt, and agave in a food processor. (If you have one, a mini food processor is ideal for this task.) Chunks of nuts should be visible—don’t over process. Add the lemon juice, ½ tablespoon at a time, and whiz until the nut mixture sticks together. Press evenly into tart pans. Slice the apples as thinly as possible, just before preparing the tarts (a mandoline is ideal for this job), and sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent browning. Arrange the slices in concentric circles atop the raw crusts. Pile about 1 teaspoon of the fruit garnish in the center. Drizzle with the prepared syrup and dust with extra cinnamon. Serve immediately. Variations: Substitute a ripe pear or an Asian pear for the apple.
