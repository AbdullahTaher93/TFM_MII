Place a large wok or skillet over medium heat and wait about 30 seconds. Add 1 teaspoon oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the beaten eggs, and slowly tip the pan in all directions, allowing the eggs to spread into a thin layer. Keep tilting until the eggs have reached their limit and are cooked through. Use a spatula to transfer the cooked eggs to a plate, then cut the eggs into small pieces or strips with a dinner knife. Wipe the wok or skillet clean with a paper towel and return it to high heat. Wait another 30 seconds, then add 2 tablespoons oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the broccoli, onion, carrots, and salt, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the tofu or chicken, zucchini or summer squash, and more or less garlic, depending on your taste. Turn the heat down to medium, and stir-fry another 3 minutes or so, until the vegetables are all “tender-crisp.” Fork in the rice a little at a time, as you keep the mixture moving over medium heat. When all the rice is in, dump in the peas and scallions, and shake in about 20 good shakes of soy sauce, as you stir and cook for just a minute longer. Stir in the almonds. Serve hot, and pass shakers of condiments.
