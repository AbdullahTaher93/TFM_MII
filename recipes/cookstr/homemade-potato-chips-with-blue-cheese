Peel the potatoes and slice them into thin ¼-inch slices, using a mandoline or sharp knife. Soak the potatoes in water for 5 minutes. Drain them and thoroughly pat them dry. Pour enough oil into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan to reach halfway up the sides (don’t go any higher up the sides than that, because the oil will bubble up considerably as you put in the potatoes). Heat the oil until a deep-frying thermometer registers 375°F. Carefully slip about 15 potato slices into the oil and fry, moving the slices with tongs or a slotted spoon, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the chips to paper towels to drain, and season immediately with salt. Don’t overseason, as the blue cheese will be very salty as well. Repeat until all the potato slices are fried. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place a layer of chips in a baking dish and sprinkle with some of the blue cheese. Place another layer of chips on top and add some more cheese. Continue until you have used up all the chips and cheese. Put into the oven and bake until the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.
