Preheat oven to 350° F (180° C) In a bowl with a fork, mash feta with mozzarella until well crumbled and mixed together. Set aside. In a small nonstick saucepan, combine red onions, red peppers, 1 tsp (5 mL) olive oil and the cayenne pepper. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, for 4 minutes or until softened but not browned. Remove from heat; stir into cheese mixture. Stir in mint and eggs until well mixed. Cover bowl and refrigerate at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours. On a dry surface, layer 3 sheets of phyllo on top of one another, lightly brushing with olive oil between layers. Brush top surface with oil. Cut the layered phyllo into quarters. Carefully lift each quarter and gently fit into the middle of an oiled muffin cup, fluting the edges that rise off the cup to resemble a nest. Repeat layering-cutting-nest-building procedure with remaining 3 phyllo sheets to produce a total of 8 nests. Spoon one-eighth of cheese mixture (about 3 tbsp [45 mL]) into each nest. Bake undisturbed for 20 minutes or until phyllo is golden brown and the cheese filling has set. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Unmold from the muffin tin (they’ll slip off easily). Serve 2 nests per person.
