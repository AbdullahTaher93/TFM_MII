Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F. Grease a 12-by-17-inch baking sheet (half sheet pan) with the butter. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain it, reserving about ½ cup of the pasta water. Combine the cream and ¾ cup of the Parmigiano in a large bowl. Add the pasta and enough of the reserved pasta water to loosen the consistency slightly. Season with salt and pepper, and toss to thoroughly combine. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, spreading the pasta out evenly. Scatter the remaining ¾ cup Parmigiano over the top. Bake until golden and crisp around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes (use the convection mode if that is an option). Let the gratin cool for 5 to 10 minutes to set up, then cut into 8 to 12 rectangles.
