Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet over high heat. As the butter begins to brown, add the chicken breasts (in 2 batches if necessary) and brown on both sides, turning once. Remove to a warm plate, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and set aside to keep warm. Add the mushrooms to the same skillet and saut√© until the mushroom juice evaporates and the mushrooms are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the Madeira and reduce by half, about 3 minutes, then add the chicken broth. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer the mushrooms for 5 minutes. Remove the lid, raise the heat to high, add the leeks, and stir in the cream. Cook, stirring, until the sauce is slightly thick, about 2 more minutes. Add the chicken to rewarm, then sprinkle with bacon and serve. Serve with simple steamed Basic White Rice
