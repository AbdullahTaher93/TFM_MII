Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Season the quail inside and out with the nutmeg, salt, and pepper, then tuck a couple of sage leaves into the cavity. Wrap a strip of pancetta around each bird, tucking the ends underneath. Place the apples in a large roasting pan, and toss with the butter and sugar. Arrange the quail on the apples. Roast for 25–30 minutes, turning occasionally, until both the quail and apples have turned golden brown. Transfer the quail and apples to a serving platter. Stir the Calvados into the roasting pan and stir over high heat until it boils. Cook for 30 seconds, then pour over the quail and apples. Serve at once.
