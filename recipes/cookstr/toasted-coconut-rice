Place the coconut in a dry medium saucepan and set the pan over medium heat. Cook until the coconut is golden brown and toasted, 3 to 5 minutes, shaking the pan frequently to prevent burning. Add the rice and coconut milk. Increase the heat to medium high, bring to a simmer, cover, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
