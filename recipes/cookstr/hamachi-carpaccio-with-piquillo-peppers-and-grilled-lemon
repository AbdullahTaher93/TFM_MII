Set a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot (or heat a countertop grill). Cut the lemon into ½-inch slices. Pour the olive oil into a shallow bowl and dip the lemon slices in it to coat both sides. Cook the lemon slices in the hot skillet for about 30 seconds, or until lightly charred on both sides. Remove and set aside. In a nonreactive bowl, mix the lemon juice, orange zest, tomatoes, peppers, basil, chives, and mint. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Slice the hamachi ½ inch thick and arrange on 4 plates. Spoon the tomato-pepper mixture over the hamachi and let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. Season to taste lightly with salt and pepper and garnish each plate with charred lemon slices.
