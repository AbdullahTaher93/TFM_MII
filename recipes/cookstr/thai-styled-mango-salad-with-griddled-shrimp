Slide 5 shrimp on to each skewer. For the marinade, mix together the ingredients. Drizzle half of this mixture over the shrimp. Pit the mango and cut it into thin strips. Mix these with the other half of the marinade, and the bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro, pepper, spring onions and a sprinkle of sea salt. Heat a large frying pan and toast the sesame seeds in the dry pan until golden. Remove and set aside. Fry the shrimp over a high heat for 2 minutes until cooked through. Sprinkle the sesame seeds and drizzle the olive oil over the salad then serve.
