Preheat the oven to 350°F, and position the rack in the middle of the oven. Line 1 large or 2 smaller baking sheets with parchment paper. Sliver the garlic as thinly as possible. Cut the tomatoes in half. Cut larger ones in quarters. Arrange the tomatoes, cut side up, on the baking sheet, leaving plenty of space in between. Drizzle each tomato with oil and rub with your fingers to coat well. Sprinkle with the garlic, herbs, and salt. Reduce the oven to 300°F and bake for 2 to 2½ hours, until the tomatoes are shriveled and beginning to brown. Let cool, and transfer to an airtight container or jar if not using right away.
