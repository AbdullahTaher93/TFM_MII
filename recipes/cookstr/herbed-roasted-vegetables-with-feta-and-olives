Position the oven racks so that they are evenly spaced. Preheat the oven to convection bake at 475Â°F. Cover two rimmed baking sheets with foil and coat with nonstick spray. If preparing the vegetables ahead of time, put the potatoes in water to cover with 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Combine all the remaining vegetables in a large bowl with the olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs. (Drain the potatoes well and add to the vegetables at this point if they are prepared more than an hour in advance.) Divide the vegetables between the prepared pans. Spread the vegetables in an even layer. Roast on the center or lower oven rack for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring once, or until the vegetables are browned on the edges and can be pierced easily with a fork. Sprinkle with the feta and roast for 5 more minutes or just until the feta is soft. Remove from the oven and top with the olives and chopped basil.
