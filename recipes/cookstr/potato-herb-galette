Prepare ahead The galette can be made up to 4 hours in advance. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grate the potatoes. Mix the potatoes, onion, egg, herbs, flour, and nutmeg together and season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a 10in (25cm) nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add the potato mixture, spreading it to make a thick potato pancake. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the underside is browned. Place a baking tray on top of the pan and flip the galette over. Slide it back into the pan to brown the other side. Bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.
