Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the chicken breasts, smooth side up, on a work surface with the thickest portion to your right. Butterfly the breast by cutting through the thick side toward the tapered side so that you can open the breast like a book. Sprinkle the butterflied chicken breasts inside and out with ½ tablespoon of the thyme leaves, a pinch of salt, and a grinding of pepper. In a small bowl combine the remaining ½ tablespoon thyme, the figs, the goat cheese, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the garlic, ½ teaspoon salt, and a grinding of black pepper, to combine. Spoon the stuffing onto one side of each chicken breast, dividing it evenly. Close the chicken over the stuffing. Wrap a slice of pancetta around each chicken breast. Hold the breast closed and the pancetta in place with a toothpick or a small metal skewer. Oil a large (about 13 × 9-inch) shallow flameproof baking pan with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Place the chicken breasts in the pan and roast in the oven for 10 minutes. Turn and roast the other side until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven; transfer the chicken to a serving platter and cover with foil. Add the wine to the pan and heat to a boil over high heat, scraping up the browned and reducing the wine to a syrup, about 5 minutes. Drizzle the wine over the chicken, and serve.
