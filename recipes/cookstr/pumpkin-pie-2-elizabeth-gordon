Preheat the oven to 375°F. Roll out the chilled crust between 2 sheets of parchment paper until it is large enough to fit into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Remove the parchment paper and press the crust into the pie plate. Crimp the edges and prick the crust all over with a fork. Lightly grease a sheet of aluminum foil with canola oil, then press it down over the crust. Place pie weights on top of the foil. Bake the crust for 25 minutes, or until it is golden brown. Remove the crust from the oven and then remove the pie weights and foil. Allow the crust to cool completely. Place the pumpkin puree, oil, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, allspice, ginger, and black pepper in the pitcher of a high-speed blender. Blend on high for 1 minute, scrape down the sides of the pitcher, then blend again for another minute. Pour the “custard” batter into the cooled crust, then let it chill for 3 hours, or until set, before serving. Because of the low melting point of the coconut oil, be sure to keep the pie refrigerated until just before serving and right after cutting it. Store the pie, covered and refrigerated, for up to 2 days.
