Sprinkle the sugar evenly in a heavy 9-inch skillet. Cook, without stirring, over medium high heat, swirling the pan from time to time, until the sugar has dissolved and turned a dark golden brown. Add the heavy cream all at once; it will sputter and begin to boil rapidly. Cook over medium heat, stirring gently, until the hardened sugar dissolves in the hot cream and the cream begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Stir in the orange zest. Pour the sauce into a measuring cup and allow it to cool slightly. Add the vanilla. Serve the sauce warm or at room temperature. (The sauce can be made ahead and reheated to soften.) Arrange 4 fig halves in a circle, cut side up, on each of four large dessert plates. Place 4 orange sections between the figs. Place a rounded teaspoon of mascarpone on the center of each fig half. Drizzle about Â¼ cup of the caramel sauce in ribbons over each serving of figs and oranges. Serve at once.
