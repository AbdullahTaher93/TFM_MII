Let’s optimistically presume you’re doing this, first off, with actual fruit. So, cut the peaches into quarters, and taking each quarter, in turn, hold over the mouth of the blender and peel off the skin (this is because you’ll lose juice as you do it). Drop the skinned fruit into the blender canister and purée. If the purée is too tart, add confectioners’ sugar to taste and purée again. (One of the virtues of the bought pulp, is that it isn’t made with underripe fruit.) Leave this hamster-colored pulp in the fridge to chill. Your only remaining job is to pour the bottle of also chilled Prosecco into a large pitcher, then pour in the white peach purée and stir together.
