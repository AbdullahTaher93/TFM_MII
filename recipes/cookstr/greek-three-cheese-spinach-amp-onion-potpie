Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish. Layout the phyllo pastry sheets and stack them. Use plastic wrap to roll up and tightly rewrap any leftover phyllo and refrigerate it for up to 1 week. Using the bottom of the baking dish as a guide, use kitchen scissors to cut 6 pieces of phyllo that are 1 inch larger all around than the baking dish. Immediately cover the cut sheets of phyllo completely with a damp dish towel. Set aside while you make the filling. Make the filling: In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat for about 1 minute. Add the onions and cook until they soften, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Set aside. Rest a strainer over a medium bowl, put the spinach in the strainer, and use a large spoon to press firmly on the spinach to press out the liquid. Discard the liquid. In a large bowl and using a large spoon, stir the onions, drained spinach, ricotta, feta, Jack cheese, eggs, dill, parsley, salt, and pepper together to combine them. Spread half of the filling in the baking dish. Place 2 pieces of the phyllo pastry on top of the filling in the dish. Brush the pastry lightly with melted butter. Top with one more piece of phyllo. Tuck any overhanging edges under to form a smooth edge that neatly covers the filling. Spread the remaining filling over the phyllo. Top with 2 more pieces of phyllo and brush them lightly with butter. Top with the remaining phyllo sheet and brush it with butter. Use a sharp knife to mark 12 squares by cutting through the top layers of pastry. Bake until the topping is golden and the filling is bubbling gently, about 45 minutes. Use a sharp knife to cut through the marked squares and a spatula with a wide blade to remove and serve the squares.
