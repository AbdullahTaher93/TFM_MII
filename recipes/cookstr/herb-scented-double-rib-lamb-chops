Line a large 17 × 13-inch shallow baking sheet with aluminum foil shiny side up, and place the baking sheet on the rack in the upper third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°E, preferably for 30 minutes or longer. Turn on your exhaust fan. Pour about ½ cup of the oil into a bowl and stir in half the minced herbs and lots of black pepper. Use a pastry brush to apply an even layer of the seasoned oil to all sides of the lamb chops, then season again very generously with pepper. Sprinkle the chops generously, on one side only, with salt. Place one or two large well-seasoned cast-iron skillets, or a large stove-top grill pan, on the stove over high heat. (Or straddle an extra-large grill pan over two burners.) As a last resort, use one or two heavy-bottomed nonstick skillets. When very hot, lay the chops in the pan salted side down in a single layer without crowding. Brown on the first side for 3 full minutes. Sprinkle the unsalted side with salt, then use tongs to turn the chops and brown them for another 3 minutes. Since double-rib chops will have a wide, thin layer of top fat, after browning them on both sides, stand the chops on this fatty side to brown and crisp it. If doing this in batches, remove each batch of chops to a tray so you can sear the rest. When all the chops are seared, transfer them to the preheated baking sheet and sprinkle them with the remaining minced herbs and a bit more salt. Roast the double chops until done to your liking: 7 to 9 minutes for medium-rare, 6 minutes for thinner loin chops. Serve hot.
