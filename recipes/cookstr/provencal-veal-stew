Prep: Finely chop garlic. Cut potatoes into ¾-inch cubes. Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season veal with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper. In batches, add veal and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 6 minutes. Transfer veal to plate. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil and heat. Add garlic and stir until garlic gives off its aroma, about 1 minute. Return veal and juices on plate to pot. Sprinkle with flour and herbes de Provence and mix well. Stir in wine and 2½ cups water, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pot. Cover tightly. Bake for 1 hour. Add potatoes, pushing into cooking liquid, cover again, and bake for 15 minutes more. Add baby carrots, submerging into cooking liquid, and bake covered until veal and potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot. Variations for Provencal Veal Stew: Use lamb neck instead of the veal for a nice change. Add 1 cup frozen baby onions, thawed, to the pot with the baby carrots.
