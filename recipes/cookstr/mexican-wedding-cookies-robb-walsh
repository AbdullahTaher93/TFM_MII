Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease two baking sheets. Beat together the butter and the ½ cup of confectioners’ sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer, at medium speed, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla, salt, and pecans and beat until combined. Remove the mixing bowl from the mixer and mix in the flour, using a wooden spoon. Do not overmix. Form the dough into crescent shapes and place on the baking sheets. Bake for 12 minutes or until the edges and bottoms are golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile, put the I cup of confectioners’ sugar in a large bowl. When the cookies are cool enough to handle, put a few at a time in the bowl and shake to coat with the sugar. Remove and continue until all the cookies are coated. Then sift confectioners’ sugar over each to give them a second sugar coating.
