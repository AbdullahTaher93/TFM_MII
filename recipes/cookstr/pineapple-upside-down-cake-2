Preheat oven to 350°F. Melt the butter and pour into the bottom of a 9½-inch spring form pan. (Place the pan on a piece of aluminum foil to catch any butter that leaks through.) Press the brown sugar evenly over the butter and sprinkle with the rum. Arrange 7 of the pineapple slices over the brown sugar. Fill in the spaces with the pecan halves. Set aside. Cream the margarine and granulated sugar in a mixer bowl. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Beat in the vanilla. Sift the flour, ginger, baking soda, and salt together. Beat into the butter mixture alternately with the reserved pineapple juice. Pour the cake batter over the pineapple slices in the spring form pan. Bake until the center of the cake springs back when gently touched, 40 to 45 minutes. While the cake is still hot, remove the side of the pan. Invert the cake onto a platter and remove the pan bottom. Serve the cake warm or at room temperature. Top with dollops of whipped cream.
