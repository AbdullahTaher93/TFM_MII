In a food processor, process 2 cups of the walnuts and 2 cups of the pecans until they just begin to release their oils. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Repeat with the remaining 2 cups of walnuts and 2 cups of pecans. Add the chocolate sauce, raisins, coconut, maple powder, coconut butter/oil, and salt, and mix until thoroughly combined. Transfer the mixture to a parchment-lined sheet pan and spread into an even layer. Place in the refrigerator to chill and set. In a high-speed blender, blend the coconut meat, agave nectar, vanilla, and salt until very smooth and shiny. With the blender running, add the coconut butter/oil and continue blending until fully emulsified. Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Stir 2 cups shredded coconut into the mixture and spread it in an even layer onto the chilled fudge base. Sprinkle the remaining 2 cups of shredded coconut over the blended layer. If using additional chocolate oil, drizzle it over the top of the coconut. (The chocolate drizzle adds more chocolate flavor, but it melts easily once the bars are out of the refrigerator, so feel free to leave it out.] Place the pan in the refrigerator to chill and set, about 30 minutes or more. Cut into 64 bars, cutting lengthwise into 4 pieces and crosswise into 16 pieces (or cut into any size you wish] Store the finished bars in the refrigerator.
