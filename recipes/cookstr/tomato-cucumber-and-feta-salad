In a small sauté pan, sauté the garlic in the 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the garlic is caramelized and slightly crunchy. Set aside and Let cool to room temperature. Arrange the sliced vegetables on individual plates or a platter. Top with the olives and the crumbled feta. Whisk together the vinegar, 1 cup olive oil, and oregano. Season each salad with salt and pepper, drizzle with the dressing, and top with the sautéed garlic.
