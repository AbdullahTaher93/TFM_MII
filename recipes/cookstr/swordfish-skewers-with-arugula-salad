Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and chili powder in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the swordfish pieces and stir gently. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning the fish cubes over once. When ready to cook, preheat the broiler and position the broiler rack 4in (10cm) from the heat. Oil 8 long metal skewers. Thread the fish and peppers on to the skewers. Broil the skewers for 5â€“8 minutes, brushing with the marinade and turning occasionally, until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily. (Alternatively, cook the skewers on an outdoor grill.) Meanwhile, to make the arugula salad, whisk the oil, vinegar, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Add the arugula and toss. Put any remaining marinade in a small pan and boil rapidly for a minute. Serve the fish with the marinade spooned over it, accompanied by salad.
