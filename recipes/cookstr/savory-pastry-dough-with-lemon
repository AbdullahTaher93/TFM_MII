If making by hand: Using 2 table knives or a pastry cutter, combine the flour, butter, and salt in a large bowl, cutting the mixture together until it resembles small peas. Work in the eggs until the pieces of dough begin to adhere. Sprinkle the lemon juice over the dough and work only until the dough comes together. If using a food processor: Combine the flour, butter, and salt in the work bowl of the food processor and pulse briefly until combined. Add the eggs and the lemon juice and pulse just until a ball of dough begins to form, less than 10 seconds. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently pat the dough into a disk. Do not knead or overmix. Wrap the disk tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. Variation: To make Savory Pastry Dough with White Wine, substitute 4 to 5 tablespoons dry white wine for the lemon juice.
