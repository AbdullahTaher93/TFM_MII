For the duck breasts: Preheat the oven to 400°F. With a sharp knife, cut the flesh side of the duck breasts in a shallow crosshatch pattern. Season with salt and pepper. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat until the pan begins to smoke and sear the duck, fat-side down, 2 minutes. Pour off the grease and place the pan in the oven until the duck is medium-rare, 10 to 12 minutes. Turn and cook the other side 1 minute. Remove from the pan and pour off the grease. The duck breasts will retain their heat while you prepare the sauce. For the green peppercorn sauce: Place the pan the duck was roasted in over high heat and add the port and wine to the duck juices (be careful--they may ignite). Add the peppercorns and any juices that have accumulated around the cooked duck breasts and scrape the bottom of the pan, bringing up the browned bits and incorporating them into the juices. Boil for 2 minutes, then add the veal stock and boil gently 5 to 6 minutes. Swirl in the butter and season with salt and pepper. To serve: Cut each duck breast on the bias into 8 to 10 slices and arrange on individual plates. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the sauce, or to taste, over the duck and serve immediately. Variations: Veal stock makes the richest sauce, but, if necessary, substitute Duck Stock, Vegetable Stock, or Chicken Stock.
