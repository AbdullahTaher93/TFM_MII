In a saucepan, cover split peas with water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until peas are tender. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, in a large skillet or wok, heat oil over medium heat. Add cinnamon, cumin and fennel seeds. Toast, stirring, for 1 minute or until seeds turn brown. Add turmeric, ginger, cauliflower and stock. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Stir in peas and heat through. Sprinkle green onions over top. Serve immediately. Variation: Use mung beans in place of the dried split green peas.
