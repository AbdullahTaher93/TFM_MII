Arrange the fish pieces in a shallow, lightly greased baking dish, preferably earthenware. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the garlic and salt in a mortar and mash to a paste (or put the garlic through a garlic press, then mix in the salt). Transfer to a processor, add the egg yolks and lemon juice, and beat a few seconds. With the motor running, drizzle in the oil until a mayonnaise is formed. Spoon some allioli over the fish (save the rest for some other purpose), place in a 450Â°F oven, and bake 10 minutes to each inch of thickness.
