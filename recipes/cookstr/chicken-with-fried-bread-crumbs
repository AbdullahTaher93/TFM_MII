Put the chicken into a large pan with the onion, 1 garlic clove, the peppercorns, and salt, cover with cold water, and bring to a simmer. Continue simmering for about 15 minutes, add the carrots, and cook for 10 more minutes. Add the zucchini and continue cooking over low heat until the chicken is just tender and the vegetables still a little al dente, about 10 minutes. Strain, reserving the stock. Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole and gently fry the onion and remaining garlic until translucent. Blend the tomatoes to a fairly smooth sauce and add to the onion with Â½ cup (125 ml) of the reserved stock. Let the sauce reduce over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and vegetables, the raisins; almonds, chorizo, chiles, and chile juice and cook slowly for 8 minutes more, stirring the mixture from time to time to avoid sticking. The sauce by then should be reduced. Heat the oil in a skillet, add the bread crumbs, and fry them, stirring them all the time until they are an even gold color, about 8 minutes. Then sprinkle the bread crumbs over the chicken and vegetables and serve immediately.
