Place the eggs in a large pot of cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for 12 minutes. Set in the sink under cold running water. Crack the shells while the water is still cooling the eggs. When cool, remove the shells. Cut the eggs lengthwise in half. Remove the yolks to a separate bowl and discard 4 cooked whites. Mix the yolks with the remaining ingredients. When ready to serve, fill a pastry bag with the yolk mixture and pipe it into the egg whites. Set on a platter and serve.
