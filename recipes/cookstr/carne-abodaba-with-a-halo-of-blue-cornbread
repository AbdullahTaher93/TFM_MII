Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine caribe, water, salt garlic, oregano, and cumin in a food processor or blender and process until well blended. Pour a little of the chile purée into a 9 × 13-inch baking pan, and then add a layer of pork chops. Add more purée, the remaining chops, and then remaining purée. Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 30 minutes longer, or until sauce is thickened and meat is fork-tender. Meanwhile, prepare cornbread. First, generously butter a 9-inch ring mold. Line bottom only of mold with waxed paper. Butter paper. In a large bowl, stir together cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, beat eggs, and then beat in melted butter and sour cream. Combine egg mixture with dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Gently fold in corn. Pour 1/3 of batter into prepared ring mold, and then alternate slices of Jack and Cheddar cheese on top of batter. Pour on remaining 2/3 of batter and bake about 45 minutes, or until bread is golden brown on top and a wooden pick inserted in center (not down through cheese) comes out clean. Cool in mold on a cooling rack for 10 minutes. When pork is tender, remove from oven. Remove and discard bones from chops and cut meat into ½-inch-thick strips. Return meat strips to sauce in a baking pan. To serve, gently run a dull knife around edges of cooked cornbread, and then invert onto a platter. Lift off mold and peel off paper. Spoon 2/3 of pork mixture into center of ring, and the spoon remaining 1/3 around ring. Garnish pork mixture with chopped onion.
