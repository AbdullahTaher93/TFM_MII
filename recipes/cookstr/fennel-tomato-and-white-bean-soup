REMOVE the fuzzy green tops from the fennel, chop coarsely, and reserve. Remove and discard the stalk or save it for broth. CHOP the fennel bulb by first cutting it in half (lengthwise from top to bottom) and then slicing each half. Chop the slices into Â¼-inch chunks. Combine the fennel, onion, garlic, broth, and bouquet garni in a 4-quart pot. Simmer gently for 15 minutes, until the vegetables soften slightly, then add the tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes more. STIR in the beans and their cooking liquid, the parsley, and reserved fennel leaves. SUGGESTIONS AND VARIATIONS SUGGESTIONS AND VARIATIONS
