In a food processor, pulse the olives, garlic, pine nuts, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil until just smooth enough to spread, hut stop before it becomes a paste. Itâ€™s OK if some of the pine nuts remain whole and some of the chunks of olives are bigger. If the mixture is too stiff, add a second tablespoon of olive oil. Covered and refrigerated, Olivada will keep for at least a week. It is best served at room temperature.
