Put the herbs/greens, lemon juice, salt, garlic, cheese, and nuts in a food processor. Pulse the processor a few times to get everything a little mashed down, then run the processor and drizzle in the oil, starting with about 1?2 cup. Stop, scrape down the sides with a spatula, and taste. Salt? Check. Lemon juice? Check. Consistency? Check.
