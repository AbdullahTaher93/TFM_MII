Chicken pieces may be skinned or left as they are. Flatten breast quarters so they will fry evenly. Sprinkle all pieces with lemon juice and let stand at room temperature I hour. Pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with a little salt and dredge well with flour. Dip into beaten egg until all sides are well coated. Dredge thoroughly with breadcrumbs. Let stand at room temperature with breading 20 minutes before frying them. Heat lard in large skillet. Melted fat should be about 2" deep. Sauté, turning once so that pieces become golden brown on both sides. Once chicken is brown, lower heat and fry 8 to 10 minutes on each side. Total frying time should be about 25 minutes. Arrange chicken in open baking pan. Pour a little melted butter over each piece and bake in 350°F oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until breading is very dry and crusty.
