Drain the broth from the seitan (you’ll likely get ¾ to 1 cup) into a soup pot or large, steep-sided stir-fry pan. Cut the seitan into bite-sized chunks and set aside. Add the broccoli, green beans, carrots, and garlic. Bring to a rapid simmer, then lower the heat. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the broccoli and green beans are bright green. Cook the noodles according to package directions until al dente, then drain and cut into shorter lengths. Set aside until needed. Meanwhile, add the broth with shiitake mushrooms, seitan, white mushrooms, and baby corn to the stew. Bring to a rapid simmer, then lower the heat, Cook over medium-high heat, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender-crisp, about 8 to 10 minutes. Put the cornstarch in a small bowl or mixing cup and stir in just enough of the liquid from the soup pot to smoothly dissolve it. Slowly pour into the soup pot and simmer just until the broth has thickened up. Stir in the soy sauce and noodles, and serve at once.
