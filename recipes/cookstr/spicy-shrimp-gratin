Toss the shrimp, lime juice, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl and let stand for about 15 minutes. Position the broiler rack about 8 inches from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes, until softened. Add the chiles and garlic and cook about 5 minutes more, until tender. Spread in a large, ovenproof serving dish. Drain the shrimp and arrange over the onions. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in the cream sprinkle with the Gruy√©re. Broil about 5 minutes, or until the shrimp turn opaque and the cheese is golden brown. Serve immediately.
