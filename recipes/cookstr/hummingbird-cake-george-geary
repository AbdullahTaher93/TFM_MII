Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C) In a bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and nutmeg. Set aside. In a mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment, beat oil and sugar until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until light, about 2 minutes. Add bananas, pineapple, pecans and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture in three additions just until blended. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes before transferring to rack to cool completely. For best results for decorating, wrap cake layers in plastic wrap and freeze for 1 to 2 days. Decorate with any of the icings(see Notes) or one of your favorites.
