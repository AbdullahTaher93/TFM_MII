To make the tomato sauce, heat the oil in a shallow casserole and sauté the onion and garlic until the onion is wilted. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, water, parsley, salt, pepper, sugar, and wine. Cover and simmer 15 minutes. (If this tomato sauce is to be used in other recipes, continue to simmer 1 more hour, then purée and strain.)
