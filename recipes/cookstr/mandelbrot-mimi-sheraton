Beat the eggs with the sugar and salt until very white and the mixture ribbons when a little of the batter is allowed to drip back into the bowl. With a whisk or beater, blend in the butter until the mixture is free of lumps. Add the orange juice and orange and lemon rinds. Sift 3 cups of flour with the baking powder and add to the mixture. The dough should be soft and workable but not sticky. Add the remaining flour if needed. Fold in the seasonings and nuts and mix well. Let the dough chill in the mixing bowl for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a jelly-roll pan. Divide the dough in half and shape each batch into a round about 2 inches in diameter. Place on the jelly-roll pan, which should hold both rolls. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown on top. The rolls will be flat on the bottom and curved on top. As soon as the mandelbrot is baked, carefully remove it from the pan and cut into Â½-inch zweiback-like slices. Put the slices, cut side down, on the same baking sheet without regreasing it Put back into the oven for 5 minutes. Turn and bake to toast the second side for 5 minutes longer. Cool on a rack. When thoroughly cool, store in an airtight container. These can be retoasted to restore crispness.
