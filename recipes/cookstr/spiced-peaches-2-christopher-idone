In large nonreactive kettle, combine the peaches and remaining ingredients with enough cold water to barely cover. Cover with a round of waxed paper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the peaches can be easily pierced with a sharp paring knife, about 15 minutes. Transfer the peaches to a shallow dish, leaving the syrup in the saucepan. When the peaches are cool enough to handle, peel them and return the peels to the saucepan. Raise the heat to medium and cook the syrup until it is reduced by half. Divide the peaches into 2 (1-quart) canning jars. Strain the hot syrup, then ladle over the peaches. Divide the spices equally and discard the peels and lemon slices. Cover with the lids to seal and cool to room temperature. When cooled, tighten the lids and store the peaches in the refrigerator. (The peaches will keep for 4 to 5 weeks.)
