Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9 × 14-inch casserole. Remove the sun-dried tomatoes from the oil and finely chop them. Save the remaining oil. Put the garlic, herbs, salt, and 3 tablespoons of the oil from the tomatoes in a blender or food processor. Blend until just pureed. Lay the fish in the prepared pan. Spread the herb mixture over the fish. Sprinkle on the chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Bake for 12-15 minutes on the middle rack of the oven, until the fish begins to flake.
