Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Cake: In a bowl, stir together flour, baking powder and baking soda; set aside. In a food processor or blender, purée buttermilk, honey, oil and bananas until smooth; stir into flour mixture just until mixed. In another bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until a tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan on wire rack. Frosting: In a food processor, purée ricotta, honey, lemon zest, lemon juice and cornstarch until smooth. Transfer to a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until steaming hot. Remove from heat. Chill. Spread cold frosting over cooled cake. Sprinkle with walnuts and strips of lemon zest.
