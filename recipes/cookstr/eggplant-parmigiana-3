In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and gently fry the garlic, shallots, and oregano, being careful not to let the oil get too hot or the garlic will be bitter. Cook for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring continuously. Add the sugar and season with salt and pepper. Place half the tomato sauce in the bottom of the slow cooker, and layer the eggplant slices on top, sprinkling fresh basil and Parmesan cheese between the layers, and staggering the slices to fit the slow cooker. Finish with the rest of the tomato sauce and give the pot a shake to distribute the sauce through the layers. Cover and cook on low for 4 hours. Just before serving, heat the remaining tablespoon olive oil in the skillet, and fry the breadcrumbs until crisp. Serve each portion sprinkled with the breadcrumbs and freshly chopped basil.
