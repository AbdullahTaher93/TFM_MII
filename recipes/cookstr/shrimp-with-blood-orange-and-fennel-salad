Cut the shrimp in half lengthwise, keeping the shell and tail intact. Using a sharp knife, cut off both the top and bottom of the blood oranges. Remove the skin and the pith (the white part) from the outside of each orange. Carefully cut in between the segments to remove the flesh of the orange without any membranes. Work over a bowl to collect the juices. Place all of the segments in a strainer set over the bowl to collect the juices. In a large bowl combine the shrimp, rosemary, garlic, hot pepper sauce, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss well, cover with plastic, and let stand for 1 hour on the counter or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. Put the fennel, celery, celery leaves, and parsley in another large bowl. Cover with 4 cups of ice water, stir in 1 tablespoon salt, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes but no longer than 24 hours. This will keep the fennel and celery crisp and prevent them from turning brown. To make the blood orange vinaigrette: Combine the collected blood orange juice, about 3 tablespoons, with the raspberry vinegar. Whisking constantly, slowly add 3 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Preheat the broiler or grill to its highest setting. When ready to assemble the salad, remove the fennel, celery, celery leaves, and parsley from the ice water and pat dry. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and grill, shell side down, until cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. If broiling, place the shrimp shell upside down on a sizzle platter or baking sheet on a rack 5 inches from the heat. Move the pan every few minutes until the shrimp are ready, 5 to 10 minutes, depending how hot the broiler is. Toss the fennel mixture with the orange segments and the blood orange vinaigrette. Arrange the salad on individual plates, distribute the shrimp evenly on top, and serve.
