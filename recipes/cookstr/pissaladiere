To make the dough, stir the flour, yeast, brown sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the center and add the water and oil. Stir to make a soft dough, adding more water if needed. Knead on a floured work surface for about 8 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Place in an oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for about 1 hour, until doubled. For the topping, heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole over low heat. Add the onions, garlic, herbs, thyme, and bay leaf. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, adding a little water if the onions begin to stick, for about 45 minutes, until very tender. Drain in a sieve, discarding the thyme and bay leaf. Let cool. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly oil a 13 × 9in (33 × 23cm) rimmed baking sheet. Knead the dough briefly on a floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle to fit the baking sheet, and transfer to the pan. Prick all over with a fork. Spread the onions over the dough. Drain the anchovies, reserving 3 tbsp oil. Arrange the anchovy fillets in a crisscross pattern over the onions, and garnish with the olives. Drizzle with the reserved anchovy oil, and sprinkle with pepper. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the crust is brown. Let cool slightly. Cut into serving pieces and serve warm, or cool completely.
