Wash the Swiss chard, kale, and spinach under running water. Dry on paper towels. Coarsely shred and set aside. Fry the salt pork in a 4- or 6-quart heavy soup pot for 5 minutes over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, onion, and thyme. Sauté over medium-high heat until the pork is browned and crisp and the garlic and onion are soft and translucent, but not browned. Drain off and reserve any fat that may be left on the bottom of the pot. Add the Swiss chard, kale, spinach, scallions, and ham to the pot and lightly sauté 2 or 3 minutes. Pour in the broth, bring to almost a boil, lower the heat, and gently simmer, partially covered, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, reheat the reserved fat in a nonstick skillet. It might be necessary to add a little extra vegetable oil. Sauté the okra and peppers, just until the okra is lightly browned and the peppers become aromatic. Scrape into the simmering soup, then add the crabmeat and coconut milk. Simmer 10 minutes, or until the okra is soft and the crab is heated through. Season with salt to taste and serve in a heated tureen or soup bowls, with Tabasco on the side if desired. If you prefer, add boiled rice to the tureen or ½ cup of rice to each bowl before adding the soup.
