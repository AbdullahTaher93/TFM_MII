To make the cajeta, place the unopened can of milk in a heavy saucepan and cover completely with water. Over very low heat, bring the water to a bare quiver and simmer very gently 3 hours, adding more water as necessary to keep the can covered. Wearing an oven mitt, turn the can over and cook for 2½ hours more. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate overnight. To make the crepes, in blender, combine the milk, egg, egg yolks, flour, granulated sugar, butter, vanilla, cloves, cinnamon and salt. Blend until smooth. Chill 1 hour. Heat a small nonstick skillet or omelet pan over medium high heat. Pour in about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the batter, swirling the pan to coat evenly. Cook until small bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook on the second side until golden. Slide onto a plate and make the remaining crepes in the same way, stacking them on the plate as you go. To serve, preheat the oven to 250°F. Open the can of cooked condensed milk and stir well with a fork, blending to an even, thick consistency. Spread about 1 tablespoon of the cajeta evenly over the surface of 1 crepe. Scatter some of the toasted pecans over the top and roll into a cylinder. Repeat with the remaining crepes, and reheat in the oven for a few minutes. Arrange 4 crepes on each plate. Sprinkle with confectioners’ sugar, scatter the raspberries over the top, and serve.
