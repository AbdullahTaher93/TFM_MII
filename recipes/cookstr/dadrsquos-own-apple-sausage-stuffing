Core and coarsely chop the apples and set aside. Place a large frying pan on medium-high heat and let it get hot, about 45 seconds. Add the sausage meat and cook, stirring constantly, until browned, about 4-5 minutes. Transfer the meat to a colander, let the fat drain off, then transfer it to a large bowl. Wipe out the frying pan with a paper towel, return it to high heat, and add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the diced onions, chopped apples, and fennel, if using. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 12 minutes. Add the marsala or sherry and the bouillon cube and cook until the bouillon is dissolved and the liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the sausage. 4. Add the diced bread, parsley, thyme, and salt and pepper to the bowl, and stir gently to combine.
