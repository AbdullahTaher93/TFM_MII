In a bowl, whisk the cocoa into the milk until well blended. The mixture will be thick. In a saucepan, using a whisk or an electric hand-held mixer, whip the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla until thick, pale yellow, and creamy. The mixture should form a ribbon when you lift the whisk. Whisk in the cocoa mixture. Set the saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture visibly thickens, coats the spoon, and registers about 180°F (82°C) on an instant-read thermometer, Do not allow it to boil or it may curdle. Transfer immediately to a bowl and let cool for 15 minutes, then whisk in the cream. Refrigerate until cold. Stir in the red pepper and taste. The pepper’s heat comes on slowly, so wait a moment before you decide to add more. Freeze in an ice cream freezer according to the manufacturer’s directions.
