Soak the beans overnight in cold water to cover. Drain and place in a Dutch oven with the garlic, onion, bay leaves, and water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer, covered until tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain and discard the garlic, onion, and bay leaves. Toss with the olive oil, lemon juice, and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve at room temperature.
