In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Whisk in the oil in a slow, steady stream until emulsified and smooth. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the rice, fennel, onion, chickpeas, and roasted red peppers. Add the dressing and toss well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving. Line a platter with salad greens and top with the rice salad. Garnish with the black olives and serve.
