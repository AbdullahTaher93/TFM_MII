Light the grill 30 to 40 minutes before you’re ready to cook. Snap the ends off the asparagus to remove the tough woody portion. Toss the asparagus on a baking sheet with the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and some pepper. Stir the mustard and crème fraîche together in a small bowl, and set aside. When the coals are broken down, red, and glowing, drape the prosciutto over a platter. Grill the asparagus 2 to 3 minutes, until slightly charred and tender. Arrange the asparagus on the prosciutto and drizzle the mustard crème fraîche over the top.
