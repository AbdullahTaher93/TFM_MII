Special Equipment: Large stainless-steel saucepan Large nonmetallic bowl 7–8 × 1 lb (450g) dry, warm sterilized jars Put a small plate in the refrigerator to chill before you begin. Hull the strawberries, weighing them occasionally to determine when you have 4lb (1.8kg) hulled berries. Halve the berries, put them in the nonmetallic bowl, and lightly crush with a large fork. Put the crushed berries, accumulated juices, and the lemon juice in a large pan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5–10 minutes, stirring, or until the berries are soft. Add the sugar and stir over a low heat until it completely dissolves. Increase the heat and boil rapidly for 15 minutes, without stirring, or until the jam reaches the setting point. Remove the pan from the heat and test for a set. With the pan still off the heat, use a large metal spoon to skim the surface. Let the jam cool slightly so that a thin skin forms and the berries are evenly distributed throughout. Pour the jam into the prepared jars to within 1/8 in (3mm) of the tops and seal. Let the jam cool, then label and date the jars. Store in a cool, dark place until ready to use, then refrigerate after opening.
