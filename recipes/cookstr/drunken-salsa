Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add the chiles and garlic, and dry-roast, shaking the pan occasionally, until the chiles become fragrant and the garlic is soft. Allow the vegetables to cool. Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles and place in a bowl. Cover the chiles with very hot water and allow them to steep for 15 minutes to soften. Drain and discard the water. Put the chiles, garlic, and orange juice in a blender or food processor and process to a smooth paste. With the motor running, slowly add the pulque until itâ€™s incorporated into the salsa. Season to taste with the salt. Pour the salsa into a serving bowl, stir in the onion, and garnish with the cheese.
