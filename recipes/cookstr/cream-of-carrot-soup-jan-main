In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic, covered, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add bay leaf, carrots and chicken stock. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until carrots are very tender. Discard bay leaf. In a blender or food processor, pur√©e soup in batches. Stir in milk, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Variation: Cream of Butternut Squash Soup: Substitute 4 cups (1 L) cubed peeled butternut squash (fresh or frozen) for the carrots.
