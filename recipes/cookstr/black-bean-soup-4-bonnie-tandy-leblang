Cut ham steak into Â½-inch pieces; reserve bone. Heat the oil over medium heat in a heavy, 4-quart saucepan. Add the ham pieces and the bone, onion, and garlic and saute, stirring constantly, until the onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Add the water, carrots, beans, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook 15 to 20 minutes or until the carrots are just tender. Add the spinach. Return to boiling over high heat; cook 3 to 5 minutes or until spinach has wilted. Remove ham bone before serving. Vegetarian Variation: Omit the ham steak.
