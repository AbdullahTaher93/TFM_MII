Put the caramel ingredients in a saucepan (preferably Teflon-coated) over medium heat with 1/3 cup water and simmer for about 12 minutes, until bubbles on the surface reach a light amber color. If the sugar begins to crystallize on the side of the saucepan, brush it with a wet pastry brush. Swirl the caramel as needed, but do not stir. When the caramel turns light brown, quickly pour it into six l-cup ramekins, being careful not to get any on your skin. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Fill an 18 by 12 by 2-inch cake pan with an inch of water and place it in the oven. To make the custard, whisk the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl until well blended, or whisk in an electric mixer at low speed. Heat the milk and light cream to 160°F in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and slowly pour into the egg mixture, whisking continuously for 1 minute. Pour the whisked mixture into another bowl through a strainer. Add equal amounts of the strained mixture to each of the six caramel-coated ramekins. Place the ramekins in the water-filled cake pan, cover with a sheet of aluminum foil, and bake for 35 minutes or until a paring knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove the ramekins from the oven and allow to cool. Flan may be served at room temperature or refrigerated. To serve, run a paring knife along the edge of the cup, then place a plate on top of the ramekin and invert. Flan may be served at room temperature or refrigerated.
