Toss the rabbit pieces in the flour and salt and pepper. Place a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat, add the butter, and melt. Once the butter has melted, add the rabbit and brown on all sides, about 15 minutes. Add the onions, potatoes, broth, wine, and half of the herbs. Cover and bring to a simmer. Cook the rabbit for 25 minutes, then uncover and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, sprinkle on the remaining herbs, and serve immediately.
