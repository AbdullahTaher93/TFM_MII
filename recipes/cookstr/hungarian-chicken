In a large skillet fry the salt pork over medium-high heat until lightly browned and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the onions and bell pepper to the salt pork and saut√© until the onion is soft and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the paprika and tomato paste. When the mixture is bright red, stir in the chicken broth and celery leaves. Add the chicken to the skillet, cover, and simmer slowly over medium-low heat, basting the meat occasionally with the vegetable mixture. After 30 minutes, turn the chicken pieces over, cover again, and simmer until the chicken is very tender, about 45 minutes more. Using a large slotted spoon, remove the chicken from the skillet and keep warm. Whisk together the flour and sour cream until smooth, then slowly whisk it into the pan juices and vegetables. Heat through but do not boil, stirring constantly. Season to taste with salt. Return the chicken to the skillet and coat with the sauce. Serve over wide egg noodles, rice, or spaetzle.
