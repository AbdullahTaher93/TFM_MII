Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until hot. Reduce the heat to medium; add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Stir in the chicken broth and orzo; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has been absorbed and the orzo is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the artichoke hearts, olives, dill, lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the artichokes are heated through, about 1 minute.
