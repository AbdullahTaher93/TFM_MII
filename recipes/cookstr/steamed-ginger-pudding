Butter a 6-cup heatproof bowl. Pour in the golden syrup and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Add enough cold water to come about 1in (2.5cm) up the sides of a large saucepan, and bring to a boil. Sift the flour, ginger, baking powder, and salt together. Cream the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the zest, then add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in half the flour mixture, then the milk, then the remaining flour. Transfer the batter to the prepared bowl. Cover with a double layer of parchment paper then a piece of aluminum foil, crimping the foil securely. Lower the bowl into the saucepan of water. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer for 1Â½ hours, or until a toothpick inserted in the pudding comes out clean, adding more boiling water to the pot if needed. Remove the bowl from the water. Let stand 5 minutes, then remove the foil and paper. Invert and unmold the pudding onto a serving plate. Serve hot, with additional warmed syrup passed on the side to drizzle over each serving.
