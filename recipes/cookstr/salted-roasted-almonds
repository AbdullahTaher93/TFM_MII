Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread the almonds on a baking sheet. Sprinkle them with a little water and toss on the sheet. (The water will help the salt and paprika cling to the nuts.) Sprinkle the nuts with the salt and the paprika, tossing to ensure that they are all evenly coated. Spread out the nuts in an even layer. Place in the oven and roast the almonds, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and serve warm or cooled to room temperature. Variation Spiced Nuts Any of your favorite nuts can be used. Try cashews, skinned hazelnuts, or Brazils. Paprika comes in sweet, hot, and smoked varieties, so use whichever you prefer.
