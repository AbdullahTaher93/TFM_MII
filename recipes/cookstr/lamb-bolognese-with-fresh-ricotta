Heat ¼ cup of the olive oil in a large sauté pan over high heat. Add the carrots, celery, onions, and garlic and sauté until the vegetables brown. In a separate large sauté pan over high heat, heat the remaining ¼ cup olive oil. Add the ground lamb, breaking up the meat into medium-size pieces as you brown it. (Leave the pieces of lamb in one spot in the pan, and when browned, flip each piece over and brown the opposite side.) Add the salt and pepper, 1 teaspoon of the rosemary, the oregano, parsley, basil, and bay leaves and mix well to combine. Combine the lamb with the sautéed vegetables. Add the red wine and cook until the liquid has reduced by half. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 30 minutes, breaking them up as they cook. Add 1/3 cup of the Romano cheese. Transfer the cooked pasta in a medium bowl or on a deep serving platter, and cover with the sauce. Garnish with dollops of the ricotta, the remaining 1 tablespoon Romano cheese, and remaining ½ teaspoon rosemary.
