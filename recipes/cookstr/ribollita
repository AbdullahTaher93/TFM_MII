Coarsely chop the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic and place the vegetables in a 4-quart slow cooker. Add the beans, stock, bay leaf, and rosemary and cook, covered, on the low setting for 5 hours, until the beans are tender but still hold their shape. Thoroughly wash the escarole and chop the leaves crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips; add the escarole to the cooker, along with the bread, tomatoes, and parsley, and stir gently to push the greens down into the liquid. Cover the cooker and continue to cook on the high setting for 30 minutes, or until the greens are tender. Season to taste with salt and plenty of pepper. Remove and discard the rosemary stem and bay leaf and serve the soup in deep bowls, drizzled with the oil.
