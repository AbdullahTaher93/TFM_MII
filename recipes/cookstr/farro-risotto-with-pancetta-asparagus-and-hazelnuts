Cut off the asparagus tips. Slice the stems about Â¼ inch thick. Set the tips and stems aside. Heat the oil in a heavy 4-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Stir in the pancetta and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set on paper towels to drain. Add the shallots to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Stir in the farro, reduce the heat slightly, and stir to coat. Continue cooking until the farro is lightly toasted and starts to pop, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the wine and cook until it evaporates, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1 cup of the broth and boil, uncovered, over medium-high heat until the farro has absorbed most of the liquid, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 cups broth in a second pot. When it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low. Gradually stir the remaining broth into the farro, a cup at a time, adding more as the mixture becomes dry. Stir frequently during this phase, which should take 10 to 15 minutes. When you add the last cup of broth, add the asparagus and salt to taste. Raise the heat to high. Cook, stirring almost constantly, for 3 minutes. Add the radicchio and continue cooking and stirring until the liquid thickens and the asparagus and farro are tender, about 5 minutes longer. Turn off the heat. Stir in the crisped pancetta, hazelnuts, Parmesan, and pepper to taste. Serve extra Parmesan in a small bowl at the table.
