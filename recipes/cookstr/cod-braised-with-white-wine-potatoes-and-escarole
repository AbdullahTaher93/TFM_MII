Soak the salt cod for 1 hour in cold water to cover, changing the water at least 2 times before using. Drain. In a soup pot, combine the salt cod, the 8 cups water, wine, the 1 cup olive oil, the onion, potatoes, garlic, and thyme. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 15 minutes. Add the leeks and escarole. Continue to simmer until all of the ingredients are tender, about 40 minutes. Taste the stew and season with salt, if necessary. Set aside. Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saut√© the cod fillets until golden brown on the bottom, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn the fish and add the salt cod stew. When the liquid comes to a simmer, cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer until the fresh cod is opaque throughout, 2 to 3 minutes. There should be plenty of broth; if too much of the liquid has evaporated, add a splash of water. Ladle the stew into warmed shallow bowls and float a cod fillet in each bowl. Sprinkle with black pepper and add a squeeze of lemon juice, if you like. Serve with a wedge of toasted bread to soak up the broth.
