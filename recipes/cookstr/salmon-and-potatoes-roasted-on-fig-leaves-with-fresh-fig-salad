Place ½ cup water in a 10-inch nonstick skillet. Arrange a layer of potato slices, slightly overlapping, on the bottom of the pan; sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of the thyme, a pinch of salt, and a grinding of black pepper; drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Repeat with the remaining potatoes, ½ teaspoon thyme, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until sizzling. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the potatoes are very tender, about 15 minutes. Uncover and let stand off the heat until slightly cooled. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 500°F. Lightly oil a large rimmed sheet pan. Arrange the fig leaves on the pan. If using smaller leaves, place 2 leaves, stem ends overlapping, together. Set pan aside. Prepare the fig salad: Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the figs into ½-inch-thick wedges. Cut each wedge across into 3 or more ½-inch pieces. Place them in a medium bowl. Add the red onion, lime juice, lime zest, a sprinkling of salt, and a grinding of black pepper; drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Gently fold to combine. Set aside at room temperature until ready to serve. Just before serving, carefully arrange a portion of the potatoes in a thick layer in the center of each fig leave—Top each layer of potatoes with a salmon fillet. (If not using fig leaves, spread the potatoes in a shallow baking dish and place the salmon on top.) Sprinkle the salmon with salt, a grinding of black pepper, and the remaining thyme leaves. Roast until the salmon is cooked through and the fig leaves are crisp and curled on the edges, 12 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the salmon. Slide a wide spatula under each fig leaf and transfer the leaf, salmon, and potatoes to a dinner plate. Carefully arrange a spoonful of the fig salad on top of each piece of salmon. Garnish each serving with a sprig of fresh thyme.
