Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Beat the flour, butter, sugar, eggs, baking powder, vanilla and almond extracts, in a bowl for 3 minutes, until pale and fluffy. Stir in the raspberries and almonds. Divide among the muffin cups. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until golden. Cool for 10 minutes; transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely. Melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Drizzle over the cupcakes. Top with grated white chocolate and a raspberry.
