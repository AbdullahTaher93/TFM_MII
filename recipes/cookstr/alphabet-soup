In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, combine beef, onion, and garlic and saut√©, breaking up meat with a spoon, until meat is browned and onion and garlic are tender, about 5 minutes, adding a little oil if needed. Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato juice, broth, water, seasonings, carrots, celery, and zucchini. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, 20 minutes. Add peas and pasta and cook until pasta is tender, about 10 minutes longer. Serve in bowls.
