Season both sides of scallops with salt and black pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add scallops and cook 1 to 2 minutes per side, until golden brown. In a small bowl, whisk together apricot preserves, lime juice and soy sauce. Add mixture to scallops and bring to a simmer. Simmer 2 to 3 minutes until scallops are opaque and cooked through and sauce reduces and thickens.
