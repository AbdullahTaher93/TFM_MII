Beat on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, or until the batter is blended and smooth. Fill the lined cupcake pans two-thirds full with the batter. Bake the cupcakes for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out with a fine crumb. Remove the pans from the oven. Carefully remove the cupcakes from the pans and transfer to wire racks to cool. Cool completely before filling.
