Make the potatoes: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the potatoes on a sheet pan and roast dry until easily pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly until easy to handle. Cut each potato in half. Trim a slice from the bottom of each half so the halves can stand up on their own. Chop the scraps and place in a medium bowl. Working over the same medium bowl, use a 1?2 teaspoon to scoop out most of the inside of each potato half and place the insides in the bowl of scraps. Place the shells, cup side up, back on the sheet pan. Finely chop the bacon and add it to the bowl of potato scraps. Mix in the cheese, butter, and sour cream until combined. HOLD IT? You can keep the hulled potato shells and potato mixture, covered and refrigerated, for up to 6 hours. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the potato mixture in a pastry bag with a large tip or zip-top bag with the corner cut off, and fill each potato shell on the sheet pan, like a little deviled egg. Bake until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. If desired, top with more cheese, and bake 5 minutes more, until melted. If you like, stick a potato chip in each one and top with chives. PLATE IT! Plate these guys on a long serving vessel. If you are really crazy, make them the centerpiece in the rauchbier soup and pour the soup around. BREAK IT: A touch of balsamic vinegar will add a fruity and zippy note. It may seem weird on paper, but salt and vinegar chips are the best chips.
