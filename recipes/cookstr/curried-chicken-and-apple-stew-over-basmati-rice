Pour the oil into a large skillet and heat over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until it browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they also brown slightly all over, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the coconut sauce, apple, cinnamon stick, and Â¼ cup of water. Let simmer, uncovered, until the chicken cooks through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream, if using, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook until the liquid thickens a bit, 2 minutes longer. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick. Serve the stew garnished with the almonds and flaked coconut, if desired.
