In a large bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sherry, oil, water, garlic, sugar, and ginger. Add chicken and turn to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator, for 3 to 4 hours or up to overnight, turning several times. Bring to room temperature before grilling. Preheat grill. Remove chicken from marinade. In a small saucepan, boil marinade for 1 minute. Grill chicken over medium heat, turning often and basting with marinade, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. Serve with rice, sprinkled with green onions.
