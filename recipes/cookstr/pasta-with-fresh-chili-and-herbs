Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, then drain. Meanwhile, put the olive oil, garlic, chili, and anchovies in a small saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden. Remove from the heat. Add the oil mixture to the drained pasta with the parsley, oregano, basil, and lemon juice. Toss to combine. Season to taste and serve with shaved Parmesan.
