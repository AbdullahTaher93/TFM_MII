Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) Trim tough ends from asparagus and discard (or freeze for vegetable stock). In a large saucepan, bring 6 cups (1.5 L) water to a boil over high heat. Drop asparagus into the water. Reduce heat and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes or just until tender. Drain and let cool. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, thyme and oil. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Spoon about one-quarter of the cheese mixture into center of a tortilla. Spread to within ½ inch (1 cm) of the edges. Divide asparagus into 4 portions. Lay one portion in the center of tortilla. Fold in bottom and one side and roll the tortilla around the asparagus allowing the tips to extend out the top of burrito. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Place burritos seam side down on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until heated through. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat tomato sauce over medium heat. Transfer burritos to serving plates and spoon about ½ cup (125 mL) of the sauce over top each. Garnish with thyme springs, if using, and serve immediately.
