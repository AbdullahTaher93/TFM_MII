Wash chicken. Pat dry with paper towels. Rub chicken thighs on both sides with pepper. In a bowl combine the cilantro, soy sauce, sugar, chili powder, and garlic. Rub garlic mixture over the chicken thighs. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add chicken pieces, skin side down. Cook until the skin is brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken over. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 4 or 5 minutes more or until chicken thighs are cooked through. Transfer chicken to a cutting board, skin side up. Cut each thigh into 3 strips. Serve chicken strips over brown rice if you like, sprinkle with herbs and serve with lime wedges. If desired, you can make a nice sauce by pouring off the excess fat from the skillet and adding Â¼ cup water. Boil over medium heat. Scrape up the browned bits with a wooden spoon. Let it bubble and thicken. Spoon over chicken.
