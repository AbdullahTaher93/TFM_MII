In a stainless steel or enameled soup pot, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat, then saut√© the sliced onion until tender and just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the basil, oregano, and thyme, and when the herbs are sizzling hot, pour the wine over them. Stir in the garlic and chile flakes and boil until the wine has evaporated and the mixture is beginning to sizzle again. Meanwhile, put the saffron threads and a cup of the fish stock in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the fish stock is just beginning to boil. Add the saffron mixture, the remaining 3 cups fish stock, and the tomatoes to the pot. (At this point, the base can be chilled until serving time.) Roll the leaves of Swiss chard lengthwise into a cigar-shaped bundle and cut across the bundle to make thin ribbons of greens. Place the pot containing the stew base over high heat and add all of the seafood and chard. Cover and cook until the oyster and mussel shells have opened and the fish has turned opaque, about 15 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to distribute the seafood evenly among 6 large serving bowls. Ladle the stew over the seafood. Garnish each serving with a wedge of lemon and a sprig of fresh basil, and serve at once.
