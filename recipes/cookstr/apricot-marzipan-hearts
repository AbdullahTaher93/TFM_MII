Combine butter and sugar in large bowl; beat until fluffy with electric mixer. Beat in egg until smooth. Beat in marzipan paste. Stir in flour until incorporated. Stir in almonds, apricots and lemon zest. Chill dough at least 30 minutes. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out dough to about 1/8-inch thickness on lightly floured board (dough will be very sticky). Cut into shapes with a floured heart-shaped or other cookie cutter. Place hearts on parchment-lined cookie sheets. Bake until lightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Transfer to wire racks to cool. Spread a thin layer of jam on one cookie; top with another cookie. Repeat with remaining cookies. Sift confectionersâ€™ sugar over tops.
