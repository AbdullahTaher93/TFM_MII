Combine all the ingredients except the tomato paste and bay leaf in a medium-size bowl and mix well. Pat the mixture into a 1-quart loaf pan or souffle dish. Spread the tomato paste over the top and set the bay leaf in the center. Place the loaf pan on a trivet in the pressure cooker. Pour in 2 cups water. Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure. Let cool for 20 minutes, then serve.
