Slice through the center of each piece of baguette horizontally. TO ASSEMBLE THE SANDWICHES: Smear 2–3 tablespoons of butter over the bottom half of each baguette piece. If you’re using scallion oil, spoon 1–2 tablespoons of it over and place about 6 slices of rumpled prosciutto on top. Put the top half of the baguette over the ham, and squeeze the sandwich together with your fingers to compress it before taking the first bite. For the Scallion Oil: In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, or with a mortar and pestle, process or pulverize the scallions and parsely until finely chopped. Add the olive oil and process or pulverize another few seconds to combine.
