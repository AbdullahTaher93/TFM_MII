Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Grease and line a deep 9-inch cake pan. Melt 1/2 stick of the butter in a small pan and stir in 1/2 cup of the sugar and 1/2 cup of the marmalade. Heat and stir until syrupy and then pour it into the cake pan. Beat the remaining butter and sugar together, then beat in the eggs. Chop the ginger and the dates. Mix the spices into the flour and fold into the wet ingredients along with the candied ginger and dates. Fold in the remaining marmalade. Pour the cake mixture into the cake pan and spread it out over the marmalade syrup. Bake for one hour and fifteen minutes, until just set. Allow to sit for 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving dish.
