Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly butter a 2-quart soufflé dish. Mash the cheeses together in the bowl of an electric mixer. Using the whisk attachment, add the 4 egg yolks and whip at high speed until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and wash and wipe the mixer bowl. Mix in the scallion, spinach, and dill. Season with salt and pepper to taste and the nutmeg. Beat the 8 egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer at high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold the whites into the spinach-cheese mixture and pour the mixture into the soufflé dish. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the soufflé puffs up in the dish and acquires a light golden color. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.
