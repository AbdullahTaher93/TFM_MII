Trim the fennel bulbs, discarding any brown exterior leaves and tough stems. Cut the bulbs in half lengthwise, then cut the halves into quarters. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet (or two medium skillets) over medium heat. Add the fennel and cook until it starts to brown, about 7 minutes, shaking the pan so it doesnâ€™t stick and burn. Turn the fennel so it browns and caramelizes on all sides. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine, season generously with salt and pepper, and lower the heat to medium-low. Cover and continue to cook for a half hour or longer, until the fennel is tender when pierced with a fork. If the liquid starts to evaporate, add a little more wine or water. Turn the mixture onto a serving platter and scatter a few of the wispy fennel greens over the top.
