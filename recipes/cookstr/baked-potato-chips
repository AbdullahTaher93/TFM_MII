Position the racks in the center and top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Spray the paper with oil. Peel the potatoes placing them in a bowl with cold water to cover. Remove 1 potato from the water and pat dry. Using a mandoline or plastic vegetable slicer, cut the potato into paper-thin rounds, less than 1/16 inch thick, cutting only enough slices at a time to spread in single layers on the baking sheets. Arrange the slices on the sheets and spray slices with oil. Bake until the chips are evenly golden brown, about 20 minutes (the chips on the center rack may take a few extra minutes). Slide the sheets of parchment onto a work surface and cool the chips on the parchment. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Store uncovered, or use within 6 hours. Just before serving, sprinkle with salt.
