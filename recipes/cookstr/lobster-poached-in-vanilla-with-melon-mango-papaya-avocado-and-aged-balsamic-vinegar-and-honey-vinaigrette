For the Lobsters: Fill a large pot with water. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla beans into the water; add the beans. Bring the water to a boil. Working with 1 lobster at a time, submerge the lobsters headfirst into the boiling water, and cook until the shells are bright red and the meat is opaque, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the lobsters to a large bowl; cool. Remove the meat from the tails and claws. Cover and refrigerate until cold. For the Salad: Whisk the vinegar, lemon juice, and honey in a large bowl to blend. Gradually add the oil, whisking until the vinaigrette is well blended. Season to taste with fleur de sel and pepper. Using a melon baller, scoop out, the flesh of each fruit to form small balls. To Finish and Serve: Cut the lobster tails lengthwise in half. Toss the lobster tails and claw meat in a large bowl with enough vinaigrette to coat. Arrange 2 claw meat pieces in the center of each of 4 large plates. Arrange 2 lobster halves around the claw meat pieces. Toss the mixed baby greens in the same large bowl with enough vinaigrette to coat (about 2 tablespoons). Mound the greens atop the lobster pieces, dividing equally. Toss all the fruit with 1 tablespoon vinaigrette. Arrange the fruit around the greens and serve immediately.
