Heat the butter and oil in a heavy skillet. Dip the chops in flour, then in the beaten egg, and finally roll in the breadcrumbs. Press the crumbs in well. Brown the chops on one side rather slowly over medium heat. Turn carefully and brown on the other side. Season well with salt and pepper. Turn once again. The total cooking will take 15 to 20 minutes. Test with a skewer. When the chops seem quite tender and are nicely browned, transfer them to a hot platter. Remove all but 2 tablespoons fat from the pan. Combine with the flour and brown and blend well over medium to medium high heat. Stir in the Tabasco and milk and stir till thickened. Add the parsley and dill and simmer 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream. Heat through but do not let it boil. Serve the sauce with the chops. Also serve potatoes and green beans.
