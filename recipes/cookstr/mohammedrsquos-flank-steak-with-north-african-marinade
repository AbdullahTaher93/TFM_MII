In a small bowl, combine the marinade ingredients and mix well. Pierce the steaks all over on both sides with a sharp fork. Place in a large zip-top plastic bag. Pour the marinade over, seal the bag, and squish everything to coat the meat well. Let marinate in the refrigerator overnight, turning the bag occasionally. Let it come to room temperature before cooking. Light a charcoal fire or preheat your gas grill on high. Oil the grill’s cooking surface. Let the coals bum down to a medium-hot fire or adjust the gas grill burners to medium-high. Pat the steaks dry, place it on the grill, and cook 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare or to your desired degree of doneness. Remove to a platter, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes, then cut across the grain into ¼-inch-thick slices. Serve immediately.
