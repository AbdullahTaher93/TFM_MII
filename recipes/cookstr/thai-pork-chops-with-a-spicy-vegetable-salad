Place the pork chops in a bowl. Sprinkle them generously with salt and pepper. Combine the lime juice, olive oil, and fish sauce in a spouted measuring cup, and pour the marinade over the chops. Toss to coat them well. Marinate, loosely covered, at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours; or cover and refrigerate for 6 hours, turning the chops occasionally. Shortly before serving time, prepare the Spicy Vegetable Salad: Whisk the lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar together in a small bowl. Set it aside. In a large bowl, toss together the tomato, cucumber, scallions, celery leaves, shallots, and jalape√±o. Set this aside. Preheat a barbecue grill to high. Remove the chops from the marinade. Oil the grill rack well, and arrange the chops on it. Grill, basting often with the marinade, for 7 minutes per side. Arrange the chops on an oval serving platter. Toss the reserved dressing and the salad together, and spoon over the pork chops. Serve immediately.
