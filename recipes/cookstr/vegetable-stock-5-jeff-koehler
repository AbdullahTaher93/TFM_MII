In a stockpot, Dutch oven, or another large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Cook the onion, leek, and carrots until they begin to brown and release their juices, about 5 minutes. Add the turnip, celery, potato, parsley, peppercorns, salt, and water. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Strain and reserve the stock, discarding the solids.
