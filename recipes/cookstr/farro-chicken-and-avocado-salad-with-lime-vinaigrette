Make the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, lime juice, jalapeno, and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set it aside. Bring 1 quart of salted water to a boil in a pot set over high heat. Add the farro and cook until it is tender but still toothsome, about 30 minutes. Strain the farro, transfer it to a bowl, toss it with the oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Put the chicken and stock in a pot, season with salt and pepper, and slowly bring the stock to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until the chicken is just cooked, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain, reserving the stock for another use, and set the chicken aside. Thickly slice the chicken crosswise; add the avocado, bell pepper, lettuce, onion, and cilantro leaves to the bowl with the farro. Add the chicken and the vinaigrette. Toss, and transfer the salad to a large serving bowl. Garnish with the cilantro sprigs and serve.
