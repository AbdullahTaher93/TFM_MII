Cover the rice sticks with the hot tap water in a large bowl; soak until the noodles are barely tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the noodles and keep them close to the stove. In a measuring cup or small mixing bowl, whisk together the ingredients for the sauce and keep it near the stove. Make the omelet. In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the salt. Preheat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Put the oil in the pan and swirl the pan to coat it with the oil. Sauté the garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute, then pour in the eggs. When the eggs begin to set, stir gently with a heatproof silicone or wooden spatula until they are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Add the drained noodles to the eggs and toss with a heatproof silicone or wooden spatula until the noodles and eggs are evenly distributed. Pour the sauce mixture over the noodles and eggs, increase the heat to high, and cook, tossing constantly, until the noodles are evenly coated. Add the bean sprouts, half the peanuts, and half the green onions. Continue to cook, tossing constantly, until the sprouts are heated through and the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and sprinkle with the remaining peanuts and green onions and the cilantro. Serve hot, passing the lime wedges separately.
