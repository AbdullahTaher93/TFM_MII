Place the potatoes in a pot and cover them by 1 to 2 inches/2.5 to 5 cm with cold water, salt the water and place the pot over high heat. Bring the water to a boil and cook until the potatoes are done, 15 to 20 minutes. Test the potatoes for doneness by inserting a sharp, thin-bladed knife into them. Drain the potatoes and allow them to cool. Peel the potatoes using a paring knife and transfer them to a large bowl. Crush them with a masher, being careful not to overwork them. Lightly flour a work surface and mound the potatoes in the center of it. Sprinkle the flour over the potatoes and gently knead them together. Make a well in the center of the potato-flour mound. Crack the egg into a small bowl, beat it, and pour it into the well. Use a fork to work the egg into the potato-flour mound. As soon as it is incorporated, begin using your hands to knead the dough until it is no longer sticky. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Roll out each portion of dough, one by one, into a rope-like length Â½ inch/1 cm in diameter. Re-flour the work surface periodically to keep the dough from sticking. Cut each rope into 1-inch/2.5-cm pieces and roll each piece into a small ball. If you would like to create a ridged surface to catch sauces, roll each gnocchi off the back of a fork, pressing gently so the tines make an impression. Cook the gnocchi in boiling salted water until they rise to the surface, about 5 minutes.
