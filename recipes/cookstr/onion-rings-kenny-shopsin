Preheat a deep fryer or a large potful of peanut oil over high heat to 375Â°F. Pour the stock or water into a small bowl for dipping the onion rings and pour the flour into a similar-sized bowl for dredging. Separate the sliced onions into individual rings. Dip the rings into the stock or water and then drop them into the flour. Toss the rings around so they are coated on all sides, then shake off any excess flour. Drop the rings into the deep fryer and cook until they are golden brown and crunchy. Remove the rings from the fryer, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
