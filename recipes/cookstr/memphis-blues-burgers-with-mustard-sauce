FOR THE BURGERS: Preheat a flat-top grill pan to high. Place the sliced onion on the grill, and cook until lightly charred and tender, about 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef, grated onion, salt, and pepper. Make eight small burgers equal in size, about 3 inches across. Cook the burgers on the flat-top for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Serve on the split rolls with grilled onions, tomatoes, pickles, and Mustard Sauce. FOR THE MUSTARD SAUCE: Stir all the ingredients together in a small mixing bowl.
