Preheat oven to 400°F. Trim chicken and pound between two sheets of plastic wrap to an even ¼-inch thickness. Whisk eggs with water in a shallow dish or pie plate. Place flour in another dish and combine macadamia nuts and Panko in a third dish. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off excess. Then coat with egg mixture and finally with breadcrumbs. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add two chicken breasts and cook 2 minutes per side to brown the nuts-do not burn. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and repeat with remaining chicken breasts. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Serve topped with a spoonful of chutney. To make the chutney combine all ingredients with ½ teaspoon salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and then lower the heat and simmer until mixture has a jamlike consistency and fruit and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until ready to serve.
