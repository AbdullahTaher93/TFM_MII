Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the fruit and cinnamon stick. Cook gently, stirring often, until the fruit has completely softened. Stir in the sugar and heat for a couple of minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the lemon juice. Serve warm with a spoonful of yogurt or a drizzle of honey.
