Bring a gallon of water to a boil in a large pot and add all of the shrimp ingredients except the shrimp. Boil the water for 15 minutes, then add the shrimp. Remove the pot from the heat immediately and allow the shrimp to steep for 4 minutes, or until the shell separates easily from the meat. Drain the shrimp in a colander and set aside until cool enough to handle. Peel and devein the shrimp. To make the red rémoulade sauce: Combine all the ingredients except the olive oil and green onions in a bowl. Add the oil a little at a time, stirring constantly, until all oil is absorbed. Taste the sauce and add more chili sauce or Creole mustard if needed. Stir in the green onions. To make the white rémoulade sauce: Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and stir to blend. Place the shrimp on a leaf of lettuce, sliced avocados, sliced tomatoes, or Belgian endive leaves. Drizzle half the shrimp with one sauce, half with the other. The sauces can also be served in pools for dipping.
