Cut each roll in half and pull out most of the soft crumbs. Rub the insides of the rolls with the cut sides of the garlic. Mix the oil and vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle over the cut surfaces of the rolls. Mix together the tuna, green pepper, scallions, cucumber, green beans, and olives. Divide the tuna mixture among the bottom halves of the rolls. Top each with equal amounts of the sliced egg and tomatoes, then 3 anchovy fillets and 2 basil leaves. Cover with the top of the rolls. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
