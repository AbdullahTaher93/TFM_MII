Combine all of the ingredients in a large, heavy saucepan, preferably low and wide. Place over medium heat and cook until the tomatoes begin to split and break down. Lower the heat and cook slowly, stirring often until the jam thickens—one and a half to two hours. To test the jam for the proper consistency, take a spoonful off the heat and let cool on a small plate—look for a golden, jam-like thickness that is still pourable. Let cool, ladle into jars and refrigerate.
