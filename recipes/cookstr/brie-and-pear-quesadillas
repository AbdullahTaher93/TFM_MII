Layout tortillas on the work surface (as many at a time as your space will allow). Slice 4 eighth-inch wedges of Brie for each tortilla and lay across one half of tortilla. Press four to five thin slices of pear into the Brie. Sprinkle about one hefty tablespoon minced jalapeños over the pears and fold the tortilla in half, pressing the halves together firmly. The filled quesadillas can be stacked, slightly overlapping, wrapped well, and refrigerated for 24 hours before proceeding. Heat a griddle or skillet over medium high heat. Spray lightly with cooking oil. Lay quesadillas in the skillet, without crowding (quesadillas should not touch), and cook until crisp and lightly browned, flipping once, about three minutes per side. Repeat for remainder of quesadillas, placing them on warm sheet pans in a single layer as they are finished. Alternatively, the quesadillas can be sprayed directly with the cooking oil, laid on sheet pans in a single layer, then baked in a preheated oven at 350° until crisp. Cut each quesadilla into five wedges and serve warm. Quesadillas can be browned and crisped, then held for up to an hour, uncut. Reheat quickly in a hot oven, cut into wedges and serve.
