In a small bowl, place Â¼ cup water and the unflavored gelatin and stir well to mix. In a saucepan, place the milk and 1 tablespoon sugar and heat to hot, but not boiling. Pour the gelatin mixture over and stir until the gelatin dissolves. Stir in the almond extract and remove from the heat. Pour the mixture into a 9-inch square glass pan. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 4 hours or longer. Rinse the raspberries with cold water and drain very well. In a blender or food processor, place the raspberries and the remaining 4 tablespoons sugar and blend until smooth. Strain through a colander to remove the seeds. Pour the sauce on a serving plate and place in the refrigerator to chill. Before serving, cut the gelatin into 1-inch diamond-shaped pieces and place on top of the raspberry sauce. Garnish with mint leaves and serve.
