Working over a bowl to catch the juices, cut the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces and drop them into the bowl. Then squeeze the cut tomatoes a handful at a time to soften them and squeeze out even more juice. Add the minced scallion or chives and sesame oil and stir to mix. Add the salt and stir, then taste and adjust the oil and salt if you wish.
