Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Butter a shallow baking dish. In a small saucepan, over low heat, melt the butter, then blend in the flour and cook for about 2 minutes. Beat in the milk, then the cream, and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Remove from the heat. Stir in the cheese and cook until melted, then add the tomatoes, sugar, cayenne, and white pepper. Taste for salt, and add to taste, starting with about Â½ teaspoon. Stir in the macaroni. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake until the surface browns, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve hot.
