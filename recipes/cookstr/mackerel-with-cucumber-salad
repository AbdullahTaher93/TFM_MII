To make the salad, run a vegetable peeler down the length of the cucumber to shave it into long thin strips, discarding the seeds. Combine the cucumber, shallot, dill, and green pepper. Whisk the lemon juice and mustard in a small bowl, and whisk in the oil. Pour over the vegetables, season with salt and pepper, and toss. Position the broiler rack 6in (15cm) from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Cut two or three slashes into the skin of each side of the fish. Season with salt and pepper. Broil, turning once, for about 8 minutes, until the flesh is opaque when pierced with the tip of a knife. Serve hot with the cucumber salad.
