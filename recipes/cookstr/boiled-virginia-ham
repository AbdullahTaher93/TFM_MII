Preferably soak overnight in water to cover, then discard the soaking water. Cook in enough cold water to fully cover. If the ham is being cooked without soaking, the water should be changed midway through cooking. Discard first cooking water and start over with fresh hot water to cover. Bring the ham to a near simmer, then adjust the burner to hold the cooking to what we always called a mull—just a quiet bubble. Never let boil; as the meat cooks through the heat will have to be adjusted to keep it below the boil. Keep the water above the ham by adding hot water as it is cooked away. Cook for at least 6 hours, at which time the bone begins to protrude at the top of the ham. Test the ham for tenderness by piercing with an ice pick or a skewer. If the ham seems too hard, leave to cool in the cooking liquid for 2 hours. Remove to a rack to drain and set for 15 minutes. Slice with a sharp, wide-bladed knife. It is easier to slice with the skin on while still warm. Trim some of the skin off the slices and some fat—but not all; ham fat is flavorsome and goes well with the lean in a boiled dinner.
