Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Prick the eggplant once with a knife. Place it on a baking sheet in the oven and roast until the skin is wrinkled and the eggplant has collapsed, about 1 hour. Remove and set aside until cool enough to handle. Slit the eggplant open lengthwise and scrape the pulp from the skin. Finely chop the pulp and transfer it to a medium-size bowl. Add the oil, salt, and vinegar to the eggplant, and stir until thoroughly blended. Leave in the bowl, or transfer to a platter and shape into a loaf. Cover the salad and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. To serve, garnish with the lemon slices or herb sprigs, and accompany with bread.
