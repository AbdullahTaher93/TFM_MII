Combine all the ingredients except the coconut butter/oil in a blender. With the blender running, add the coconut butter/oil and continue blending to emulsify. Store the syrup in a covered container in the refrigerator. Before serving, place it in the dehydrator to warm the sauce so that it’s liquid enough to pour. If you don’t have a dehydrator, you can also place the container in a warm water bath to liquefy it. (If the room is warm, simply let the sauce sit at room temperature.)
