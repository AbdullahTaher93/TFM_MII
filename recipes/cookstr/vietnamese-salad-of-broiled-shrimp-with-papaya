Position a broiler rack 4in (10cm) from the source of heat. Preheat the broiler. Line the rack with aluminum foil and lightly oil. Spread the shrimp on the foil and brush with oil. Broil for 2â€“3 minutes, turning once, until the shrimp turn opaque. Meanwhile, whisk the fish sauce, lime juice, vinegar, sugar, chile, garlic, and 6 tbsp cold water together in a bowl until the sugar dissolves. Add the shrimp to the bowl and stir. Let stand until cooled. Add the papaya, cucumber, and chopped mint, and toss together. Transfer the salad to a serving platter, and arrange the shrimp on top. Garnish with the mint sprigs and serve at once.
