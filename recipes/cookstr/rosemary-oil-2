In a small saucepan, heat the rosemary and oil on low heat until the aroma is released, 3 to 4 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for a minute or two, then transfer to a heat-proof glass container and let cool completely. Allow the rosemary to steep in the oil at room temperature for 2 hours, then cover tightly and refrigerate for 2 days. Before using, bring the oil back to room temperature and strain through a sieve, discarding the rosemary leaves. The oil can be stored refrigerated in a tightly covered container for up to 2 weeks.
