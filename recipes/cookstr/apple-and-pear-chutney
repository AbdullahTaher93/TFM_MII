In batches, pulse the apples, pears, golden raisins, raisins, onion, lemon, ginger, garlic, and chile in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a large saucepan and add the vinegar, brown sugar, mustard, and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes, until the juices are syrupy. Have ready five hot, sterilized, 1qt (1 liter) glass canning jars and lids. Using tongs or oven mitts, transfer the jars to a baking sheet. Carefully fill the hot jars with the hot chutney, then cover with the lids. Let stand to cool completely. Wipe the jars clean. Store in a cool dark place for at least a few weeks before opening.
