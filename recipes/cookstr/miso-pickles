In a medium mixing bowl, stir the mirin and garlic into the miso to combine. Add the daikon to the bowl and, using a rubber spatula, fold it into the miso mixture, taking care to coat each piece of daikon completely Note that the pickle may seem pasty and dry; depending on your miso. Fear not; it will release liquid as it cures. Transfer the pickle to a clean wide-mouthed pint jar with a well-fitting lid, using your hands to help press the pickle into the jar. Label and date the jar, and allow it to sit at room temperature for 24 hours, then move it to the refrigerator for 4 days. Your pickle will now be ready to eat. Some people prefer to rinse off the clinging miso brine before eating, whereas I like its sharp saltiness all around. Be sure to try it both ways. Kept refrigerated, this pickle will last (and, in fact, get better) for up to 3 months.
