Cook the cauliflower in boiling water with 1 teaspoon salt until just tender, about 6 minutes. Drain the cauliflower, reserving the cooking water. In a large skillet, saute the garlic and onion in the olive oil until onion is soft. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook, covered, for about 6 minutes. Uncover the skillet, add the crushed tomatoes, remaining salt, and pepper, and continue to cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes. Add the cauliflower, basil, and cheese. Stir, then cover and keep warm. Bring the reserved cauliflower water to a boil, add the spaghetti, and cook until al dente, tender but not mushy. Drain the spaghetti well, then add it to the sauce, mixing well to distribute the ingredients. Serve immediately. Variation: Add Â½ cup pitted and chopped oil-cured olives to the sauce.
