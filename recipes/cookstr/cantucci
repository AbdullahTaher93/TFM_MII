Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and butter one large baking sheet. Whisk the eggs and yolks together in a bowl. Transfer 2 tbsp of the mixture to a small bowl and set aside. Combine the flour, almonds, sugar, baking powder, and orange zest in a large bowl and stir together. Make a well in the center, add the beaten egg mixture, and stir to form a stiff dough. Gather the dough into a ball, then cut in half. On a lightly floured surface, shape each portion into a log about 2in (5cm) wide and 1in (2.5cm) tall. Place the logs well apart on the baking sheet. Flatten them slightly and brush the tops with some of the reserved egg mixture. Bake for 20 minutes or until logs are lightly browned and feel set when pressed in the center. Remove from the oven and increase the temperature to 400°F (200°C). Cool the logs for 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. With a serrated knife held on a slight diagonal, cut into ½ in (1cm) pieces. Return the slices to the baking sheet, flat sides down, and continue baking for 8 minutes more, or until crisp and golden. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
