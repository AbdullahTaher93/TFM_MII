Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Season the partridges all over with salt and pepper. Melt the butter in a large, flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. One at a time, add the partridges and cook, turning often, about 10 minutes, until browned. Transfer to a plate. Add the oil to the pan and heat. Add the pancetta, onions, and garlic. Cook over medium heat for about 4 minutes, or until the bacon begins to brown. Add the cabbage, apples, apple juice, vinegar, juniper berries, and orange zest and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the jelly. Place the partridges in the casserole and cover. Transfer to the oven for 25–30 minutes, until the partridge juices are clear, not pink, when the meat is pierced with a fork. Let stand, uncovered, for 10 minutes before serving.
