Prepare the orzo: Bring the broth to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the orzo, reduce the heat, and simmer, uncovered, until just tender, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain, and return the orzo to the pan. Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine. Cover to keep warm. Prepare the shrimp: Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise, and remove and discard the seeds and core. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook, shaking the pan, until wilted, 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, prosciutto, and peas. Cook, shaking the pan, until the tomatoes are softened, 5 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high and add the shrimp. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the basil and cook, shaking the pan and turning the shrimp, until the shrimp are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve the shrimp over the orzo in shallow bowls.
