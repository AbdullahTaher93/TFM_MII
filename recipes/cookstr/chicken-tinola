In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the onions, ginger, and garlic and saut√© until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and fish sauce and cook, stirring, until the chicken is well coated with oil, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 8 cups of water, raise the heat, and bring to boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, adding the papaya when the chicken is almost tender, 30 to 40 minutes total. Stir in the sili and malunggay leaves, if using. Cook until heated through and wilted if fresh. Season with fish sauce, to taste.
