For the sauce, in a medium saucepan mix the berries, sugar, and lemon juice. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil. Remove from the heat. The sauce will thicken as it stands. For the pancakes, preheat the oven to 200Â°F. Mix the flour, wheat germ, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Mix the buttermilk, oil, and egg yolks in a large measuring cup. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks, using an electric mixer. Mix the yolk mixture into the dry ingredients just until moistened, then fold in the whites. Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat until hot. Lightly grease the skillet with spray vegetable oil or butter, and then drop 1/3-cup portions of batter on the skillet, spreading them a bit if thick. Drop fruit onto the pancakes, and press it down. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until bubbly, turn, and cook for a couple minutes more. Transfer to an oven-safe platter and hold in the oven until all of the pancakes are done. Serve the pancakes topped with yogurt and the blueberry sauce.
