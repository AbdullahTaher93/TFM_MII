Sauté the onions and garlic in the oil in a deep saucepan with a heavy bottom. When the onions are just translucent, add the peppers, eggplant, and zucchini, and mix together well. Reduce the heat, cover the pan tightly, and simmer for 10 minutes, shaking the pan or tossing the vegetables 2 or 3 times so they cook evenly. Add the tomatoes and the seasonings and continue simmering for another 10 or 12 minutes. Uncover the pan and allow the mixture to cook down and the liquid to reduce, stirring frequently. The vegetables should be somewhat intact, well mixed and blended but not mushy and liquid. Taste and correct the seasoning. VARIATIONS Ratatouille with Sliced Mushrooms: Add ½ pound sliced mushrooms to the ratatouille 5 minutes before the end of the cooking time. Ratatouille with Sliced Fennel: Add 1 large bulb of fennel, thinly sliced, with the eggplant, peppers, and zucchini. Ratatouille with Leeks: Add 2 sliced leeks with the eggplant. Ratatouille with Poached Eggs and Cheese: Serve the ratatouille in small individual ramekins or baking dishes topped with a poached egg and covered with shredded Gruyere cheese. Run under the broiler or place in a 450° oven just long enough to melt the cheese. Serve as a first course for dinner or a luncheon main dish. Spicy Ratatouille: In place of 1 cup fresh or canned tomatoes, use 1 cup Mexican canned tomatoes and hot green chilies.
