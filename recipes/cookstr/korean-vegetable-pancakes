. In a large bowl, mix the white flour, rice flour, and salt together. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the eggs and the water. Make a well in the flour mixture, and, slowly, stirring with a whisk, add the liquids to the flour. Continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth. The consistency should be thinner than regular pancake batter but thicker than heavy cream. Combine the cut scallions, carrots, and peppers in a bowl. Set the bowl aside. Place a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the sesame seeds. Let them sit until they just start to brown, then begin shaking the pan now and then until they are uniformly toasted. Combine all of the dipping sauce ingredients in a bowl, and stir. Set the bowl aside. Over medium heat, heat a griddle or a heavy skillet at least 12 inches in diameter. Pour on 1 tablespoon of the oil, then scatter a handful of the vegetables into the oil, over a roughly 8-inch circular area. Immediately ladle about 2/3 cup of the batter over the vegetables, to form a large pancake. Let the pancake cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is browned on the bottom side, then flip the pancake (I use two spatulas for this), and cook it for 2 minutes on the other side. Transfer the pancake to a plate. Continue to make the 5 remaining pancakes as in step 5, using about 1 tablespoon oil for each pancake. If youâ€™d like, hold the cooked pancakes in a warm oven until all are made. Serve each pancake with a small bowl of the dipping sauce.
