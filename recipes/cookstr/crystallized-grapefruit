Peel the grapefruits and cut the peel into long ¼ inch julienne. Place the peels in a medium saucepan and add cold water to cover. Boil for 10 minutes and drain. Repeat this process two more times with fresh water. In a saucepan, mix 2 cups water with 1½ cups of sugar. Add the grapefruit peels and bring to a boil. Boil until peels become translucent and the liquid becomes a thick syrup, about 45 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the peels to a sheet of waxed paper, allow to set for 7 minutes. Transfer the peels to another sheet of waxed paper and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of sugar. Roll the peels in the sugar and let stand for 2 hours. Serve 2 to 3 strips of peel per person and store the remainder in an airtight jar.
