To make the crust: In a food processor, combine the flour, salt, and butter, and process just until the mixture has a coarse, grainy texture. Add the vinegar and sugar and process to blend. Add the ice water and process just until a rough ball begins to form. Remove, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 4 hours. Unwrap and let stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes to become pliable. Preheat an oven to 350° F. On a floured work surface, divide the dough into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Roll the larger piece into a circle ¼ inch thick and about 12 inches in diameter. Loosely drape the circle over the rolling pin and transfer to a 9-inch pie pan. Press the dough into the pan, leaving at least a ½-inch overhang. Refrigerate while making the filling. To make the filling: In a large bowl, combine the apples, quinces, raisins, lemon zest, and juice. Sprinkle with the sugars, flour, cloves, and nutmeg; stir to mix well. Spoon the filling into the chilled pie crust, heaping it higher in the center. Scatter bits of butter over the top. Roll the remaining dough out into an 11-inch circle. Drape the circle over the rolling pin and place it on top of the pie, Tuck the edges of the upper crust under those of the lower, pinching them together to seal them. Make three or four 1-inch slashes in the upper crust to allow steam to escape. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into wedges.
