In a bowl, squash all the tomatoes, using your other hand to stop the seeds spitting at you. Mix in the olives, garlic, vinegar, rip in the herbs and pour in the olive oil. Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Then cook your pasta in salted boiling water. When the pasta is ready (al dente), drain and quickly toss in with your tomatoes. Call your guests around the table, then taste the juice at the bottom and season to taste. Serve right away.
