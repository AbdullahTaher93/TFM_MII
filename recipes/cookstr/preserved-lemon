Wash and dry a 1-quart glass jar with a tightly fitting lid. Pour a layer of sea salt over the bottom and set aside. Trim off 1 inch from one end of each lemon. Quarter each lemon lengthwise but not all the way; leave each intact at its uncut end. Hold 1 of the lemons over a mixing bowl, spread it open, and fill it up with sea salt. Place in the jar and repeat with another lemon. Press firmly on the lemons as you add them to the jar. Pour salt into the jar to fill the spaces between the lemons. Repeat, making three layers of lemons and salt (using the salt collected in the bowl), sprinkling each layer with about 1 teaspoon of salt. Seal the jar. Refrigerate at least 2 weeks before using. The lemons are best after 3 months and will keep up to a year. To use a preserved lemon, cut through the attached end. Use a paring knife to cut away all lemon flesh and pith from the yellow zest. Discard all but the zest. Use as directed in the recipes or blanch the zest briefly, dice or julienne, and add to salads, stews, or grain dishes.
