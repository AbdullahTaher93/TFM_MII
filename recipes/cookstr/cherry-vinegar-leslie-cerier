Place the cherries in a clean pint jar. Add 1 cup of the vinegar, leaving a few inches of space at the top of the jar for the cherries to expand. Put the cap on the jar, and add a label that includes the jar’s contents, date prepared, and approximate date the vinegar will be ready (2 to 6 weeks from the preparation date). Store in a kitchen cabinet or another cool, dark place. The next day, add the remaining vinegar. Give the jar a daily shake for the first few days. If needed, add more vinegar to keep the cherries covered. After 2 weeks, check the flavor. If a stronger flavor is desired, let it continue to steep. Continue to check the flavor once a week until the desired strength is reached. When the vinegar is ready, pour it through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a bowl, wide mouth jar, or measuring cup. Before discarding the strained cherries, either squeeze them through the cheesecloth or press them against the strainer with the back of a spoon to get every last drop of Vinegar. Transfer the vinegar to a clear bottle or jar, and label it with the type of vinegar and date. Store in a cool, dark place, where it will keep for at least a year. For A Change: • Use white wine or balsamic vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. • Cut up a vanilla bean and add it to the jar. • Instead of dried cherries, use 2 cups fresh pitted cherries, wild black cherries, raspberries, or other berry variety.
