Roasted Garlic Roasted Garlic Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cut off the top ¼ inch of the garlic head to reveal the cloves. Drizzle a little olive oil over and season lightly with salt and pepper. Wrap loosely in aluminum foil and roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until the garlic is very soft when squeezed. You can also open up the foil for the last 10 minutes to allow the garlic to caramelize a bit, which adds another interesting flavor note. Cool and store roasted garlic in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 3 weeks or freeze it if you have a bumper crop from your garden. Toasted Garlic Toasted Garlic
