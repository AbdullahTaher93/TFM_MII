Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and brown sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, then the milk, beating until combined. (The milk will not quite combine with the butter or the mixture will look a little separated, but this is fine.) In a separate bowl, combine the oats, wheat germ, cereal, pastry flour, almonds, cinnamon, baking powder, and baking soda. Add the chocolate chips and cranberries. Add oat mixture to the milk mixture, and mix on the lowest speed until thoroughly combined. Use a tablespoon measure or small ice cream scoop to scoop the dough onto lightly oiled baking sheets, leaving 2 inches between each scoop. Press a chocolate kiss into the center of each cookie. Bake for 14 minutes, or until lightly browned.
