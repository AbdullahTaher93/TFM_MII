Cut the pork tenderloin crosswise into Â½-inch slices. Sprinkle with the salt and white pepper. Flatten the pork by pressing down with your knife or hand and dust with 2 tablespoons cornstarch. To make the sauce, in a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, chicken broth, and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the Thai peppers and garlic. Combine the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and stir into the vinegar mixture until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup and soy sauce. Set aside. Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat and add the vegetable oil. Panfry both sides of the pork until brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Add the sauce and cook about 1 minute. Arrange the pork in 2 rows on a platter, overlapping each piece slightly. Garnish with the tomato slices around the edge of the platter and place the cilantro leaves in the center.
