Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F. Wrap each beet separately in aluminum foil. Place on a baking sheet and bake until the beets feel somewhat tender when squeezed, about 1¼ hours. Unwrap the beets. To peel, working one at a time, impale a hot beet at the stem end on a fork. Using a small knife, pare off the skin and then cut the beet into ½-inch-thick rounds. Transfer the beets to a serving bowl. Add the walnuts, oil, and vinegar, and mix gently. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
