Rinse the fish and pat with paper towels until completely dry. Rub the fish with the garlic. Combine the flour, salt, cumin, and Aleppo pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge the fish in the flour mixture, then shake off the excess. Pour the vegetable oil into a large saucepan and heat over medium heat until the oil sizzles upon contact with a drop of water. Make sure that the oil is very hot so that the flour does not simply soak it up and become soggy. Fry the fish in batches for 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the size of the fish. Turn over and fry for another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the fish and drain on paper towels.
