Cut the fish into finger-size pieces. Marinate them in the milk for 30 minutes. Season the flour with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Drain the fish, and dredge the pieces in the flour. Heat ¼ cup olive oil in a skillet, and fry the fish turning it once, until it is golden on both sides. Keep the fish warm. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet, and sauté the garlic and onion until the onion is limp. Add to the skillet the vinegar, capers, wine, and red pepper flakes. Cook over high heat until the liquid is reduced to 6 tablespoons. Pour the sauce over the fish. We like to serve this dish neither hot nor chilled but at room temperature, so all of the flavors are mellow and well combined. When you are ready to serve, mound the fish on lettuce-lined salad plates and garnish with tomato and lemon wedges. Sprinkle the fish with a drift of finely minced parsley.
