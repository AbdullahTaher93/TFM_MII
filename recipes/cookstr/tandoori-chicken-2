Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) Equipment: Shallow baking pan, lined with foil Rinse chicken and pat dry. Cut long diagonal slits against the grain, almost to the bone. In a shallow bowl, mix together yogurt, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, coriander, cumin, garam masala, cayenne pepper and salt. Add red food coloring, if using. Add chicken, turning to coat and making sure marinade goes into all slits. Cover and marinate in refrigerator for about 2 hours or for up to 12 hours. Remove chicken from marinade and place in prepared shallow baking pan. Discard any remaining marinade. Bake in preheated oven until juices run clear when chicken is pierced, about 45 minutes. Transfer pieces onto heated platter and squeeze lime juice on top while still warm. Discard accumulated juices. Garnish with sliced onion rings and lemon wedges.
