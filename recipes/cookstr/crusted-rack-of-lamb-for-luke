First, brown the lamb in a searing hot pan with a little bit of olive oil. You just want to seal the juices in, so brown it for literally just a few minutes. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg white and add the ground almonds, garlic, cumin and herbs. Mix well and then pat on the loin side of the lamb, making sure it is properly covered. You want to put the sweet potatoes in the oven about 25 minutes before the lamb, in a roasting pan, covered with the rosemary and some splashes of olive oil. When they have done their time, add the lamb to the oven in a separate pan next to the sweet potatoes and cook for 20 minutes, less if you like it really rare. The sweet potatoes should be ready at exactly the same time as the lamb if you time it like this.
