Put the pork, chopped onion, garlic, and salt into a saucepan, cover with water, bring to a simmer, and cook-about 30 minutes (much depending on quality and cut of meat). Drain the meat, reserving the broth. There should be about 3¼ cups (815 ml) of broth. Reduce or make up to that amount with water. Meantime, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and fry the peanuts (or toast in a toaster oven), turning them constantly, until they are a golden brown. Crush and transfer to a blender jar. Add the tomato verde, cilantro, peppercorns, chiles, garlic, and ¾ cup (185 ml) of the meat broth and blend until smooth (you may need a little more broth, but be careful not to make the sauce too watery). Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a heavy pan and fry the pork and sliced onion together until golden, turning the pieces constantly. Add the blended sauce and cook for a few minutes longer, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan all the time. Add approximately 2½ cups (625 ml) of the broth, then adjust the seasoning and simmer the stew for about 20 minutes, or until well seasoned. (You may need to dilute the sauce further-it should be of a medium consistency, like thin cream-and it will thicken considerably as it cooks.) Serve with plenty of the sauce and fresh, hot tortillas.
