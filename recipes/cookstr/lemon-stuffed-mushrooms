Cook the mushroom caps for a couple minutes on each side. At the same time, create an emulsion by vigorously mixing the olive oil with half of the lemon juice. Add pepper and garlic. Line the mushroom caps top-down on a plate. Pour the emulsion into each mushroom cap. Sprinkle with salt and serve with bread.
