If the beef is frozen, run it under hot water so you can remove the packaging. Place the beef on a microwave-safe plate and microwave, uncovered, on high power for 3 minutes to partially defrost. Meanwhile, rinse, pat dry, and coarsely chop the mushrooms, removing any tough stems. Set aside. Cut the cabbage in half. Cut away and discard the tough core. Using a sharp chef ’s or slicing knife, cut the cabbage into thin shreds. Set aside. Peel the carrots and grate them using the large holes of a box grater. Set aside. Heat the peanut oil in an extra-deep 12-inch skillet over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the beef (fresh or partially defrosted) to the skillet and cook, turning and breaking up the meat, until it is completely browned, about 8 minutes. Drain any accumulated fat from the skillet, if necessary. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until they just begin to release their liquid, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the hoisin sauce, sesame oil, and ¼ cup water in a 1-cup measure or small bowl. Add the hoisin sauce mixture, the cabbage, and the carrots to the skillet. Stir well, cover the skillet, and cook, lifting the lid to stir from time to time, until the cabbage is tender, about 3 minutes. While the cabbage steams, stack the tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and microwave until warm, following the package directions, 3 to 5 minutes. If desired, spread a little extra hoisin sauce in the center of each tortilla. Using a slotted spoon, place about ½ cup of the beef mixture in the center of each tortilla. Tuck in one end, roll up the tortillas burrito-style, and serve.
