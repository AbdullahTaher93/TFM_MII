Place the yogurt in a small bowl. Add the ginger, and stir briskly for about 1 minute, or until the yogurt has a saucelike consistency. Set aside. Cut each orange crosswise into 5 slices. Cut each strawberry lengthwise into 4 slices. Cut each banana crosswise into 14 slices. Spoon Â¼ cup of the ginger sauce onto each of 4 individual 8-inch plates, and spread the sauce over the plate. Arrange 5 orange slices around half the plate, overlapping the slices. Arrange 8 of the strawberry slices around the second half of the plate. Pile 7 banana slices in the center of each plate, and serve.
