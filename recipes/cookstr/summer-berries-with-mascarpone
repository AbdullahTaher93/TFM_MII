Heat the blueberries and blackberries in a large saut√© pan over medium-low heat, just until they begin to release their juices. Add the triple sec and stir in well. Add the raspberries and cook just until they begin to soften. Stir well. Spoon a mound of mascarpone in the center of each dessert plate. Surround the mascarpone with the berries, including their juices, and serve immediately.
