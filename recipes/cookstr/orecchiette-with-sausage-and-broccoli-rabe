Preheat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the sausage and brown, breaking up the sausage into quarter-size pieces as it cooks. Add the sliced garlic and sauté until it begins to pick up color. Add the broccoli rabe, roasted garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of the basil, and 1/2 tablespoon of the parsley and sauté for about 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock and cook until the liquid has reduced by one-quarter. Finish the sauce with the remaining 1 tablespoon basil and 1/2 tablespoon parsley, the salt, and pepper. Add the cooked pasta and cheese to the pan and toss to coat. Serve in a medium serving bowl or on a deep platter, garnished with the toasted bread crumbs.
