Place enough water in a large nonaluminum skillet or Dutch oven to cover the fillets by an inch or more and bring to a boil. If the fish is not extremely fresh; add the vinegar, lemon juice, or white wine. Place the fish into the boiling water and adjust the heat so that the water barely simmers; do not let it boil. Cooking time is approximately 10 minutes per inch of thickness of the fish. When done, the fish will he firm yet springy to the touch. Remove the fish from the water using a skimmer or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. To serve: Place the fish on warm plates or a platter and cover with sauce beurre blanc.
