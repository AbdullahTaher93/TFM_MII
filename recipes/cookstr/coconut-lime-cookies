Place the nuts in the freezer to chill for a few minutes. Once chilled, pulse the nuts, coconut, and lime zest in a food processor until the mixture is well combined but still a bit chunky. Be careful not to overprocess the mixture or it will become oily (chilling the nuts before processing helps to prevent this). Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and combine well. Using a small ice cream scoop or a big tablespoon, spoon rounds of dough onto teflexlined dehydrator trays and flatten them into round cookies, about Â½-inch thick. Dehydrate for about 24 hours or until the cookies reach the desired consistency.
