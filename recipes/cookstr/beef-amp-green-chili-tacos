Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and saute over medium-high heat. Crumble the meat and cook just until it is no longer pink. Transfer the meat to a strainer and strain well. Wipe out the skillet and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Add the jalapeno pepper and saute for 1 minute. Add the chili powder, cumin, and paprika and cook, stirring, until the spices are well blended into the onion mixture, about 2 minutes. Add the drained meat, chiles, tomatoes, beer, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until the, sauce has thickened. (The taco filling may be prepared up to this point and will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. Bring to room temperature before final cooking.) Serve warm with accompaniments.
