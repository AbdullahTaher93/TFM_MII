In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low to medium heat. Add the leeks and sweat until soft and wilted but not colored, about 12 minutes. Add the sweet potatoes and stock and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium and simmer until the sweet potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the cream, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer 2 minutes, skimming if necessary. Pour into a blender, or keep in the pot and use a hand-held blender, and blend well. Strain through a medium or coarse strainer. Add the extra stock if the soup seems too thick. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until well chilled. Before serving, reseason and garnish with minced chives. Serve chilled. Variations: Light cream or half-and-half can be substituted for the heavy cream. To make a classic vichyssoise, substitute potatoes for sweet.
