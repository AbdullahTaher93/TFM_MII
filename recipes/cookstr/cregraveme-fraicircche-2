At least 2½ days before you will be serving the crème fraîche, combine the cream and buttermilk in a large bowl. Stir well and cover tightly. Let stand at room temperature for 36 hours, or until slightly thickened, then refrigerate at least another 24 hours and up to 10 days before serving. It will continue to thicken in the refrigerator.
