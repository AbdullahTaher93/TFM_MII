Pour 1 cup water into the pressure cooker and set a trivet in it. Use five 6-ounce ramekins, not greased (it’s not necessary because the custards don’t get unmolded), Heat the oil together with the cabbage, oyster mushrooms, scallions, and salt in a skillet over medium-high heat until beginning to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the broth, soy sauce, and sugar. Remove from the heat, add the eggs, and whisk to mix. Divide the mixture among the ramekins. Cover each with foil, pinching around the edges to seal. Set 3 of them on the trivet. Place a second trivet on top and set the remaining 2 ramekins on it. Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat, about 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 6 minutes to finish cooking. With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining pressure. Carefully remove the lid and let sit another 5 minutes. Using 2 thick terry doth kitchen towels, lift out the ramekins. Remove the foil. Tuck a celery leaf in the top of each custard and place a dollop of the caviar alongside, if desired. Serve right away.
