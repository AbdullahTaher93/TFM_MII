In a covered pasta pot over high heat, bring water to a rapid boil. In a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic, onion and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until vegetables are soft, about 7 minutes. Add wine, tomatoes and basil, reduce heat to low and simmer until mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside. Add salt and quadrati to the boiling water and cook, uncovered, over high heat until pasta is almost al dente. Scoop out about 1 cup (250 mL) of the pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta. Return sauté pan to heat and add 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the reserved pasta water. Simmer for 2 minutes. Add quadrati and continue to cook for about 3 minutes, until pasta is al dente, using a wooden spoon to coat evenly, and adding more pasta water if necessary. Add half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano and toss well. Transfer to a large serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
