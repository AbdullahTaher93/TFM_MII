Place the quinoa and water in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the quinoa has absorbed all the water, about 12 minutes. For a firmer grain, bring the water to a boil, then add the quinoa. Remove from the heat, fluff with a fork, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes. If the quinoa tastes bitter, rinse with cold water until the bitterness disappears. Variation: Cook 1 cup rinsed quinoa in 4 to 6 cups boiling water until the grains are transparent throughout, about 12 minutes. Drain immediately, rinse, cover, and steam dry over low heat for 5 minutes. This yields perfect, separate grains, especially good for salads.
