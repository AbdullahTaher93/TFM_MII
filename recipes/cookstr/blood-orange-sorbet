Mix the juice and sugar together in a bowl and pour into an ice-cream maker. Proceed according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Make the sorbet a few hours ahead of time. Transfer it to a bowl and place it in the freezer until about 10 minutes before serving. Remove from the freezer so the sorbet softens a bit before you scoop it into dessert dishes and serve.
