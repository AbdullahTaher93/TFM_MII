In a medium bowl, combine the chickpeas, parsley, and onion. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice and zest, cumin, cayenne, salt, and black pepper. Pour the dressing over the chickpea mixture and toss to coat evenly. In another small bowl, stir together the yogurt, orange juice and zest, and honey. Serve the chickpea salad over a bed of spinach leaves. Top with the yogurt sauce and garnish with the mint.
