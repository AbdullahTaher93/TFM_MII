In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, cirmamon, baking soda, and salt. In a small, deep bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft, glossy peaks form. In another bowl, beat or whisk together the egg yolks, buttermilk, milk, butter, and maple syrup. Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Fold in the egg whites and blueberries. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat and grease lightly Scatter 2 tablespoons of wheat germ over the surface. For each pancake, spoon or pour about ¼ cup batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and the edges look dry, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat, coating the pan with wheat germ for the remaining batter. Serve immediately or transfer pancakes to a baking sheet and keep warm in a 200°F oven. Garnish with butter and maple syrup, Swiss Whipped Honey Butter, or Maple Sugar– Pecan Butter.
