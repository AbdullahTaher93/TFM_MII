Heat the olive oil in a saucepan and add the chopped onion and celery. Cook at a gentle simmer for about 15 minutes until they are soft and translucent. Add the garlic and rosemary and cook a minute more. Season with salt and pepper. Drain the porcini, reserving the soaking liquid, and add to the saucepan, mixing for a few minutes. Add the soaking liquid, discarding any sediment, and pour in the wine. Bring to a boil and cook gently until the liquid has reduced back into the mushrooms. Add the tomatoes to the pan and simmer gently until they are reduced to a thick sauce. Then add about 2 cups of water and simmer gently for another 20 minutes. Toast the bread and rub with the cut side of the halved garlic clove while still warm. Pour the soup into serving bowls, scatter with Parmesan, drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil on top if you like, and serve with the bread.
