Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C) and lightly butter a 5–6 cup ovenproof serving dish. Purèe 1½ cups of the corn in a blender. Add 1¾ cups of the cheese, the eggs, flour, melted butter, sugar, salt, and cayenne. Process until blended. Pour the corn mixture into the dish. Sprinkle with the remaining corn, and stir gently. Smooth the surface. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Bake for 45 minutes, until set and golden. Cool for 5 minutes, then serve hot from the dish.
