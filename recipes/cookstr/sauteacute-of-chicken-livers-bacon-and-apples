Examine the chicken livers and carefully remove fat and any bright green spots which you may find. Wash and pat dry. Sauté the bacon with 1 tablespoon of butter in a 10-inch skillet, until the bacon fat has rendered out. With a slotted spoon, remove the bacon bits and reserve until later. In the remaining bacon fat, Sauté the chicken livers over high heat, in 2 batches, for about 2 minutes per side. (As you do this, avert your face and do not stay near the skillet because chicken livers over heat spatter wildly.) Remove the chicken livers to a plate and reserve until later. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the fat in the skillet. In this remaining fat, sauté the shallots until soft. Then add the apples, Calvados and heavy cream. With a wooden spoon, scrape up the browned particles in bottom of pan and incorporate them into the liquids.* Return the chicken livers and bacon to the simmering cream and cook them for about 3 minutes more, keeping the heat low so that they do not toughen. Turn the heat off. Adjust the seasoning. Whisk in the last tablespoon of butter. Transfer the livers to a serving dish, and dust with parsley before serving.
