Combine ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sherry, and 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a shallow glass or stainless steel bowl. Add chicken cubes and stir well. Cover and let stand 30 minutes at room temperature (or refrigerate at least 8 hours), stirring at least twice. About 10 minutes before serving, heat a wok or very large, heavy skillet until medium-hot, and add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. When oil is hot but not smoking, drain chicken cubes, reserving marinade. Add chicken to pan and stir-fry about 3 minutes, or until meat has almost lost its pink color. Remove chicken to a warmed platter. Add snow peas, onions, and reserved marinade to pan. Stir-fry about 2 minutes. Turn off heat, and then evenly mix in chicken, basil, and hot chile. Pour onto platter. Serve over rice, and offer Hot Hot Oil to add to individual servings, if desired.
