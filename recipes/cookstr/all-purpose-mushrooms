1). Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat. After about a minute, add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. If you like, you can also melt in some butter. 2). Add the onion and sauté for about 8 minutes, or until soft. 3). Stir in the mushrooms, salt, and thyme, and turn up the heat to medium-high. Sauté until the mushrooms are cooked through and their juices evaporate. This should only take a few minutes if the pan is hot and large enough. 4). Toss in the lemon juice, and add black pepper (and possibly more salt) to taste. 5). Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
