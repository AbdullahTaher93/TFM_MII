Preheat the oven to 425°F. To prepare the cake, place the pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until fragrant and browned, about 5 minutes. Cool and then pulse in a food processor until they become very fine (be careful not to overprocess; otherwise you’ll have pistachio butter) and set aside. Reduce your oven temperature to 350°F. Grease an 8½ × 4½-inch loaf pan with ½ tablespoon of butter. Place a long strip of parchment paper in the pan bottom. Grease the top of the parchment with ½ tablespoon of butter and set aside. Whisk the flour, baking powder, cardamom, and salt together in a medium bowl and set aside. Crack the eggs into a liquid measuring cup, whisk in the vanilla, and set aside. Using an electric mixer, cream the remaining stick and a half of butter and sugar until they are light and airy. Drizzle in the eggs, a little at a time, beating between additions to incorporate and scraping the bowl as necessary. Alternate adding the flour and the milk, starting and ending with the flour and mixing until the batter is just nearly combined between additions, scraping the bowl as necessary. Fold the pistachios into the batter by hand, then transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan. Bake the cake until a cake tester inserted into the cake’s center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Let the cake cool for 10 minutes, then invert the cake onto a cooling rack and turn it so its top faces up. Let the cake cool completely. While the cake cools, make the icing: Sift the confectioners’ sugar and cardamom into a medium bowl Whisk in the lemon juice and cream or milk. Spread the icing over the cake, letting it drip over the sides. Once the icing has set, slice and serve.
