In a 1-quart pan, combine the oil and chile flakes. Heat over medium-low heat until the chiles have infused the oil with their flavor, about 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool completely. Let sit at room temperature overnight for a stronger chile flavor. Strain the chili all through a fine sieve into a glass jar. The oil will keep at room temperature for up to 1 month.
