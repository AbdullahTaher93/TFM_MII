Heat the olive oil in a very large heavy pot. Add the onions and cook over low heat, covered, until tender, about 10 minutes. Crumble the sausage meat and ground chuck into the pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the meats are well browned. Spoon out as much excess fat as possible. Turn the heat to medium-low and stir in the black pepper, tomato paste, garlic, cumin, chili powder, mustard, salt, basil, and oregano. Add the drained tomatoes, Burgundy, lemon juice, dill, parsley, and kidney beans. Stir well and simmer, uncovered, for another 20 minutes. Taste and correct the seasoning. Add the olives, simmer for another 5 minutes to heat through, and serve immediately.
