Place the tomatoes, including the juice from the cans, in a large saucepan. Crush the tomatoes using the back of a large spoon or squish them with your hand. Stir in the oregano and salt. Simmer the tomatoes, uncovered, over medium-low heat until the sauce is thick and all the liquid has evaporated, about 50 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Stir in the garlic and basil. Add the red pepper flakes, if desired. Use immediately, or refrigerate in a tightly covered container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before using.
