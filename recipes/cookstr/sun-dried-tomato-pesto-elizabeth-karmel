Put all the ingredients in a food processor or blender and process until smooth. The pesto should be perfectly seasoned without adding any salt, as many of the ingredients are inherently salty. Taste and adjust the pepper if desired. The pesto will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
