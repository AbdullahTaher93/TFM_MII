Bring 3 quarts of salted water to a boil—this will be used both to blanch the basil and cook the pasta. Drop the basil leaves, lightly packed, into the boiling water. Push the basil down into the water, cook for about 20 seconds, and then lift it out with a skimmer, and rinse under cold water. Put into the bowl of a food processor. Add the garlic, the jalapeño, and the nuts. (Make sure to taste your nuts, since they can turn rancid pretty quickly.) Process on high, using a rubber spatula to push down any of the mixture that collects on the sides of the bowl. Add the olive oil and a few tablespoons of water to make it combine better, and process until you have a beautiful green puree. When ready to cook the pasta, drop the linguine into the boiling water, and while it is cooking, grate the Parmesan cheese. When the pasta is almost cooked to your liking (I like mine firm, but not raw in the center), set a stainless-steel bowl near your pasta cooking pot, and spoon the olive oil into the bowl. Add a good dash of salt and black pepper, and then scoop out ¾ cup of the pasta cooking liquid and add it to the oil in the bowl. Drain the pasta in a colander, shaking it to remove excess water. Transfer the pasta to the bowl containing the oil and pasta cooking liquid and toss. The cooking liquid will be absorbed by the pasta. Add the pesto and a good handful of the Parmesan cheese, mix well, and taste again for seasonings. It should be well seasoned and the pasta should be quite moist. Serve immediately in hot deep plates, sprinkled with extra Parmesan cheese. Although it is an overload of carbohydrates, I like to eat bread with my pasta. Followed by a nice salad, this is one of our signature summer menus.
