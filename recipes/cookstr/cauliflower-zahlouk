Steam the cauliflower with the garlic and lemon peel in lightly salted water until very tender, about 8 minutes. Place the cauliflower and garlic in a large bowl and mash coarsely. Stir in the charmoula dressing. Alternatively, steam the cauliflower and garlic and transfer to a sauté pan. Add the dressing and sauté and mash in the pan. Fold the zucchini or green beans and the chickpeas into the cauliflower. Place in a serving dish and garnish with olives. Serve immediately.
