Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Peel and slice the squash into wheels. Place on an oiled baking sheet, brush on some olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Bake for about 30 minutes, until almost done. Meanwhile, put the basil, garlic, and olive oil into a blender and puree. When the squash starts to brown and looks almost ready to eat, spoon on some of the sauce, sprinkle with pistachios, and bake for another 5 minutes. Serve very hot. I like to slice them, pizza style, into 6 bites per pizzetta.
