Put the rice in a bowl and add enough cold water to cover by 2in (5cm). Let soak for 8 hours. Drain the rice in a colander. Line the top part of a steamer with soaked, drained banana leaves, or moistened, squeezed-dry cheesecloth. Add the rice and spread in a thin layer. Add water to the bottom part of the steamer, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium. Steam over steadily boiling water for 20-25 minutes, until the rice is tender. Heat the coconut milk and sugar in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves, then mix into the rice. Cover and leave for 15 minutes. Place a scoop of rice on a banana leaf, with the fruit on the side. Drizzle with the lime juice and serve warm.
