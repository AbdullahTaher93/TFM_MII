Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Stir together eggplant, onions, half of the oil and salt in a large roasting pan, and then roast mixture in middle of the oven, stirring occasionally, 12- 15 minutes. Stir in squash, bell peppers, 2 tablespoons oil, and more salt and roast mixture, stirring occasionally, until bell peppers are tender. This will take approximately 1/2 an hour. Then, simmer tomatoes, garlic, thyme, remaining oil, and salt in a saucepan, stirring occasionally, until thickened and bringing all the flavors to life, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir tomatoes into roasted vegetables and season ratatouille. Serve with whole wheat orzo and garnish with parsley and basil.
