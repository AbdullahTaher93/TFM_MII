Put the meat, diced onions, parsley, and salt and peppers on a wooden board or in a bowl. Knead with both hands until well mixed. Divide the meat into 15 pieces and mold these into ovals. Thread 3 of the meat ovals onto a thin meat skewer, each separated by an onion and a tomato. Set the skewers on a grill over white embers. Also place an Iraqi pita or other type of pita on the grill. Watch the meat carefully and turn after a few minutes to grill on the other side. Serve on a platter with the pita, and, if you like, with tomato halves, peppers, and parsley in the center.
