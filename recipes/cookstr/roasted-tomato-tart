Combine the ricotta, ¼ cup Parmigiano, salt, pepper, 1 egg yolk, and the herbs in a small bowl. Stir until well combined. Set aside. Dust a work surface with grated Parmigiano. Sprinkle more cheese on top of the dough. Roll into a rough circle about 10 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Turn frequently and dust with more cheese as needed to prevent sticking. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment. Spread the filling on the dough, leaving about a 1½-inch border. Arrange the tomatoes on top, leaving a little space between them, and gently fold the edges of the dough toward the center, creating a 1- to 1½-inch border. Chill until firm. Preheat the oven to 425°F, and position the rack in the middle of the oven. Gently but firmly press the sides of the tart down with slightly cupped hands. This will prevent the tart from unfurling while baking. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining egg yolk and the heavy cream. Brush the edges of the tart with the egg wash and then sprinkle with grated Parmigiano. Immediately transfer to the oven. After 10 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 400°F, rotate the baking pan, and bake 20 minutes longer. The edges and bottom should be golden brown. Remove from the oven and slide the tart, on the parchment paper, onto a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
