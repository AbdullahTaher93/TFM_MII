Place the hiziki in a large bowl and pour enough boiling water on top to cover it by 2 inches. Let sit until tender and pliable, 10 to 20 minutes, stirring once or twice. Drain thoroughly. With the motor of the food processor running, pop the garlic into the feed tube and chop. Add the hiziki, olives, capers, and oil. Process to create a coarse paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add enough lemon juice and salt, if needed, to give the tapenade an assertive flavor. (The amount you’ll need will depend upon the saltiness and flavor of the olives and capers; I’ve added as much as 1 teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.) If serving as a dip, thin the mixture slightly with olive oil, if necessary. Transfer to a bowl and garnish with thyme. Other Ideas: For a pleasing appetizer, set small mounds of tapenade in the center of plates and surround them with Slow-Roasted Tomatoes and Fennel. Serve with sliced, toasted baguette. Use a tablespoon or two of tapenade as a flavor booster in soups and stews. Thin the tapenade with olive oil and/or a tablespoon or two of pasta cooking-water, and toss with hot pasta. Add chopped fresh thyme, parsley, or basil, if you wish.
