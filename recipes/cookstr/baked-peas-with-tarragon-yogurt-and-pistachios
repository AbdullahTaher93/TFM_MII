Preheat the oven to 500°F. Put the peas in a clay pot or a small Dutch oven and gently heat them on the stove until they thaw, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, put the tarragon, scallions, olive oil, yogurt, and 1/4 cup of the pistachios into a blender and puree. Gently mix into the peas, sprinkle the top with extra chopped pistachios, and bake for about 15 minutes—about the time the top will begin to brown. Remove and serve in your best serving bowl.
