Heat the pork fat or oil in a heavy skillet and brown the chops lightly on each side over fairly high heat, allowing about 3 minutes a side. Do only as many chops at one time as will fit into the pan without crowding. Add extra fat or oil if required. Replace the chops in the skillet and add the tomatoes, garlic, green pepper, and basil. Cover the pan and simmer for 25 minutes, turning the chops once during the cooking. Add the olives and continue cooking for another 10 minutes over low heat, or until the chops are tender when tested near the bone with the point of a small sharp knife. Serve with rice mixed with chopped parsley.
