Mix together the mayonnaise, garlic, and basil in a small bowl. Set aside to let the flavors develop. In another small bowl, whisk together the oil and vinegar and brush over the tops of the mushrooms thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Light a charcoal fire or preheat your gas grill on high. Oil the grillâ€™s cooking surface. Let the coals bum down to a medium-hot fire or adjust the gas grill burners to medium. Cook the mushrooms until tender all the way through. 8 to 10 minutes per side. Serve on toasted ciabatta bread brushed with olive oil or in warm pita pockets. Top with a dollop of the basil mayonnaise and a handful of tom spinach leaves.
