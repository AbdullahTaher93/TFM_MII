Drain the yogurt in a sieve lined with a paper towel for 30 minutes, until thickened. In a small bowl, mash the garlic to a paste with the salt. Add the yogurt and blend well. Set aside at room temperature. About 20 minutes before serving, put 2 small cazuelitas in a wide saucepan of water to cover. Set over medium heat and slowly bring to a simmer. Carefully transfer the cazuelitas to a doubled kitchen towel to drain. Leave the pot of water on the stove. Add the vinegar to the water and maintain at a simmer. One by one, break an egg onto a saucer and slip into the water. Cover the pot, turn off the heat, and poach the eggs until the whites are set but the yolks are still soft, about 2Â½ minutes. Carefully remove the eggs with a slotted spatula and place 2 eggs in each warm cazuelita. Top each egg with one-quarter of the garlic yogurt. Quickly melt the butter in a small conventional saucepan. Add the Marash pepper and paprika and stir; the butter will turn bright red. Drizzle the butter over each serving, leaving the paprika powder and pepper flakes behind in the saucepan. Serve at once.
