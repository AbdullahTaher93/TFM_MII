Blanch the beans in boiling salted water for 1 minute. Drain and rinse in cold water. Using your fingers, pinch the navel of each bean and pop it out of the skin. In a large saucepan, warm the olive oil over medium-low heat until fragrant. Add the pancetta and sauté until lightly colored, about 3 minutes. Add the onion and sauté until it is nicely softened and the pancetta is lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the beans, salt, and 1 mint sprig. Stir in the water. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, 20 to 25 minutes. If the beans begin to dry out and are still uncooked, add more water as necessary. Remove cooked mint, add pepper, and serve immediately, garnished with the remaining mint sprig.
