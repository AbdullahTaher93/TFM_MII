Place leeks in slow cooker stoneware. In a saucepan, combine olive oil, coriander seeds, peppercorns, salt, white wine and bay leaves and bring to a boil. Pour mixture over leeks, cover and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours or on High for 3 to 4 hours, until leeks are soft. Using a slotted spoon, transfer leeks to a serving dish. Pour cooking liquid into a saucepan and, over high heat, bring to a boil. Boil rapidly for 5 minutes until sauce has reduced by half. Strain over leeks. Serve immediately or cover and chill thoroughly.
