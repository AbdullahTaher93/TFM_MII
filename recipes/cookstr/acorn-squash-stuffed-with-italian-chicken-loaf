Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush 2 tablespoons of the coconut or olive oil on the bottom of a large roasting pan or baking dish. Cut the squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp with a tablespoon. Place in the prepared pan. Place the ground chicken in a large mixing bowl and set aside. Place a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. When hot, add the onion, pepper and carrot and cook for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more, then remove from heat and let cool. Add the egg, salt, pepper, basil, thyme, parsley and red pepper flakes to the ground chicken. Then add in cooled vegetables. Combine well with your hands, but do not overmix. Scoop the mixture into the 4 acorn halves, distributing evenly. Bake for 1 hour and enjoy!
