Set the rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400°F. In a large bowl, toss together the blueberries and peaches (plus any juices they’ve released), tapioca, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cardamom (if using). Transfer to a 2-quart (or slightly larger) baking dish. Distribute the pecans on top, set the pan on a foil-lined baking sheet to catch spills if the fruit bubbles over. Bake until the fruit is tender and the juices are thickened and bubbly, 35 to 45 minutes. If the nuts begin to bum before the fruit is done, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil. Set on a rack and cool for about 10 minutes before serving.
