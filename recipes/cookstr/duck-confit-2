SLOW COOKER SIZE: 5½ to 6 quart Place the duck breasts in the insert of the slow cooker and add the fat, garlic, shallot, salt pepper, and herbes de Provence Cover, set the slow cooker on HGH, and cook for 1 hour. Reduce the heat to LOW and cook untill the duck is very, tender—at least 4 and up to 8 hours. Use a slotted spoon to remove the duck from the fat, which can be strained, frozen, and reused. Serve the duck hot or at room temperature, or use it to make cassoulet.
