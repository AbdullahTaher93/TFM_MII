Slice off the tops of the peppers and remove and discard the seeds and membranes. Removing the stems, chop the pepper tops and set aside. Arrange the peppers upright in a 5Â½- to 6-quart slow cooker. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and chopped pepper tops, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the couscous, lentils, onion mixture, sun-dried tomatoes, parsley, and oregano and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Mix well and spoon into the pepper cavities, packing lightly. In the same bowl, combine the tomato paste, orange juice, sugar, mustard, and water, stirring to blend. Add the cayenne, if using, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Pour over and around the peppers in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low for 4 hours, until the peppers are fork-tender but still hold their shape. Serve hot.
