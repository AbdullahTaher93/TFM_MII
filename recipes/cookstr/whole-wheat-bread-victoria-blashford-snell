Mix the bread flour, whole wheat flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Stir the hot water, milk, oil, and honey together and pour into the well. Mix to form a slightly sticky dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 10 minutes. Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface for 8-10 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. (The dough will remain slightly tacky'do no add too much flour.) Shape into a ball, place in a large oiled bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Oil and flour a 9 × 5in (23 × 13cm) loaf pan, and tap out the excess flour. Briefly knead the dough on the work surface. Press the dough into a rough rectangle and place in the pan. Cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place about for 30 minutes, or until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Brush the egg over the loaf to glaze it, and sprinkle with a little whole wheat flour. Slash a few diagonal slits in the top of the loaf. Bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 400°F (200°C) and bake for 20 minutes, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Invert and unmold onto the rack and cool completely.
