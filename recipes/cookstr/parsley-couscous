In a saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Add the salt, couscous, and butter, stir, then remove the pan from the heat. Cover and wait 5 minutes. Uncover, fluff with a fork (do not stir), add the parsley, and serve. If you need to reheat or refluff the couscous, just add a teaspoon olive oil and lightly mix with a fork.
