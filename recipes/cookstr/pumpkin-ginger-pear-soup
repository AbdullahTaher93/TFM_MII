Drain and coarsely chop the pears, reserving the juice in a small bowl. Set aside. In a 4Â½-quart saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes, or until translucent. Add the pears, ginger, and garlic to the saucepan and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the reserved pear juice, water, pumpkin, and salt to the saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour the soup into a blender, process it until smooth, and return it to the saucepan, or use a hand blender directly in the saucepan. Add the milk to the soup and stir until well blended. Reheat and serve garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds.
