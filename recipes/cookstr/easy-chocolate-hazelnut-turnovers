In a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of hot, not boiling water, melt chocolate, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in hazelnuts. Let stand over hot water while you prepare the pastry. On a lightly floured work surface, roll pastry out to a 25- by 10-inch (63 cm by 25 cm) rectangle. Trim edges so they are straight and cut into ten 5-inch (13 cm) squares. Divide chocolate mixture among the squares, placing the filling in the center of each square. Working with one square at a time, brush edges lightly with egg wash, then fold over the corners to form a triangle. Press down on the edges gently with the tines of a fork to seal. Make two small slits on the top of each turnover with a sharp knife. Place at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart on prepared baking sheets. Brush tops lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in upper and lower thirds of preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, rotating and switching pans halfway through, or until golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.
