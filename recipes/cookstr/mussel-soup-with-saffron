In a small cup, dissolve the saffron in 1/4 cup of the wine. In a 10-to 12-inch sauté pan, combine the mussels, onion, parsley, thyme, bay leaf, pepper, the remaining ¾ cup wine, the water, saffron mixture, and olive oil and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until all the mussels have opened. Remove from the heat and, using tongs, transfer the mussels to a bowl. Reserve the cooking liquid. Once the mussels are cool enough to handle, place the mussels in the shell in another bowl and then in the refrigerator to chill, reserving the juices from the bowl. Strain the mussel juices and the cooking liquid into another pan, bring to a boil over high heat, and reduce by two thirds. Divide the mussels among eight serving bowls, drizzle the broth over, and serve.
