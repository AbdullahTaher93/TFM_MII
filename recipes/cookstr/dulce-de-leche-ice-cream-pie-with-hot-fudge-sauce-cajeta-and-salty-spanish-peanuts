Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 325°F. To make the crust, combine the graham cracker crumbs with the butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Press the crumbs into a 9-inch glass or ceramic pie plate to form an even crust. Bake the crust for about 8 minutes, until it is firm to the touch. Remove the crust from the oven and set it aside (or refrigerate) to cool completely. Remove the ice cream from the freezer and thaw it at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes, until it is slightly softened. Spread the peanuts on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally for even toasting, until the nuts are lightly browned and fragrant. Remove the nuts from the oven, drizzle them with oil, sprinkle them with sea salt, and toss to coat. Scoop the ice cream into the bowl of a standing electric mixer and use the paddle attachment to beat it until it’s very soft but not melted. Spread the softened ice cream into the pie shell and freeze it while you prepare the rest of the components. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to a low simmer. Remove the lids from the jars of hot fudge sauce and cajeta and place the jars in the water for about 5 minutes, until the sauces are warmed through, stirring them in the jars occasionally. (Or warm the sauces in the microwave.) Cut the pie into wedges and serve it with the hot fudge sauce, cajeta, and peanuts on the side for people to use however much they want to of any of them.
