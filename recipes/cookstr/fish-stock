Bring the fish trimmings, onions, celery, and 7 cups water just to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Add the thyme, parsley, bay leaf, salt, and peppercorns. Partially cover the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 20 minutes. Strain the stock into a large bowl. Use immediately, or cool and refrigerate.
