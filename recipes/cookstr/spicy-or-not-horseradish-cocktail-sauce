In a medium nonreactive bowl, mix the ketchup, chili sauce, lemon juice, zest, Tabasco, and salt until well combined. Add the pepper, if desired. Serve immediately, or store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Just before serving, divide the horseradish between 4 small saucers and divide the sauce into 4 bowls. Serve a bowl of sauce with the horseradish on the side for diners to customize as they desire.
