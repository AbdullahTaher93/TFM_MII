Soak beans overnight. Pick over and discard any small stones, and rinse beans well. Place beans in a pot with the water or stock and bay leaves. Bring to a boil; reduce to a simmer, partially cover, and cook until tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons of the salt. Meanwhile, combine butter, onion, and garlic in a pot that will be large enough to hold beans and their liquid. Saut√© gently until garlic is softened. Add cabbage and stir. Cover and cook over low heat until cabbage is soft, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, bring 5 to 6 cups water to a rolling boil. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons salt and pasta. Stir, continuing to stir frequently to prevent pasta from sticking together. Cook until pasta is tender but firm (al dente), then drain and add to cabbage and beans. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir, and serve immediately. Pass parmigiano at the table.
