Preheat a large saut√© pan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the butter and 2 tablespoons of the oil. When the butter bubbles, add a pinch of salt, stir, and add the leek. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on the edges, about 10 minutes. Add the cognac, let sit for 5 seconds, then light a long match to it. Stand back and keep wayward clothing and shaggy hair away from the dancing flames. (If you have a gas stove, be aware that spattering particles may cause the alcohol to ignite prematurely.) The flame should burn out after about 10 seconds. If it continues to burn, put it out by placing a lid on the pan. Remove from the heat and reserve for topping. Preheat the grill, rollout and shape the dough, and grill the first side of the crust per the Master Instructions for gas or for charcoal (see Notes). Use tongs to transfer it to a peel or rimless baking sheet. Flip the crust to reveal the grilled side. Spread the entire surface with the garlic paste, then with the mushroom-leek mixture. Artfully arrange the cheese over the top. Finish grilling the pizza per the Master Instructions (see Notes). Remove from the grill, sprinkle with the thyme, and season generously with salt and pepper. Slice and serve immediately.
