In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the palm oil and powdered organic whole cane sugar until soft. With the mixer on low speed, add the salt, boiling water, agave syrup, and vanilla. Continue to beat, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, until smooth and fluffy. To achieve the desired consistency, turn the mixer to high speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Use right away, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. When you are ready to use the frosting, warm it slightly in a double boiler, or with a metal mixing bowl placed over a pot of simmering water, and whip it again until it is fluffy.
