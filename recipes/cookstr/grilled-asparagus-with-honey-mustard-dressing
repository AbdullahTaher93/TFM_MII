Prepare a hot fire in a gas or charcoal grill or preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of the vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Toss asparagus with the olive oil mixture to coat and place on the grill grates or on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven and cook 5 to 7 minutes, turning often, until bright green and crisp-tender. While the asparagus is cooking, combine lemon zest, yogurt, mustard, honey, chives and remaining vinegar in a small bowl, and stir until blended. Season with salt and pepper. Just before serving, arrange asparagus on a platter and season with additional salt and pepper if desired and drizzle with the dressing or serve the dressing on the side for dipping.
