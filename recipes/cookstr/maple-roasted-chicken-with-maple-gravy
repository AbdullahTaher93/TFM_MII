To Make the Chicken Preheat the oven to 400°F, with a rack in the middle position. Place the lemon inside the cavity of the chicken. Tie the legs together with string. Rub the chicken with olive oil and season it with salt and pepper. Place it in a roasting pan. Add the potatoes and shallots. Roast for 30 minutes. Pour the maple syrup and the 1?4 cup olive oil over the chicken, then lower the oven temperature to 375°F. Roast for 45 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted in a thigh should read 165°F and the juices should run clear. Reserve the drippings for the gravy. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before cutting into pieces and serving it with the potatoes, shallots, and gravy. To Make the Gravy Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock and drippings and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and let the sauce simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes. If it is still not thick enough, stir in the cornstarch mixture. Season with salt and pepper and serve hot with the chicken.
