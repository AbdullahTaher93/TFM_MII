With a fork, prick sausages all over and place in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add water and cook, turning often and adding more water as needed (to prevent sausages from sticking), for 10 to 12 minutes or until browned and no longer pink in center. Transfer to a cutting board. Let cool slightly; cut into slices. Drain fat from pan; add oil, onion, fennel, garlic and oregano; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until softened. Add potatoes, tomatoes with juice, broth, salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and cook for 15 minutes or until potatoes are almost tender. Return sausage to pan; cover and cook for 8 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Sprinkle with parsley. Variation Instead of fennel, use about 3 cups (750 mL) shredded cabbage.
