Preheat the oven to 350°F. Wash and dry the cherries. Cut into quarters and mix with the golden raisins. Set aside. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale, light, and soft. Add the eggs, one by one, and beat well between each addition. Mash the bananas and add to the creamed mixture. Sift the rice flour, cornstarch, gluten-free baking powder, and salt together and fold carefully into the banana mixture. Very gently, stir in the cherries and golden raisins, so that they are evenly distributed through the mixture. Pour the mixture into the loaf pan or into 24 small muffin cases and bake in the oven for about 1¼-1½ hours for the loaf, 25 minutes for the mini-muffins, until golden on top and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove the loaf from the tin and cool on a wire rack; cool mini-muffins on a rack in their paper cases. Slice the loaf into 8 slices to serve.
