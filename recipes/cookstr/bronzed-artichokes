At least 3 hours before you plan to eat the artichokes, trim them, cutting off all tough leaf tips. Spread the leaves slightly. Place the artichokes in a bowl and add the lemon juice and olive oil. Pour enough water over the artichokes to submerge them. Soak the artichokes for at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 hours. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200°F to 220°F. Drain the artichokes. Place the artichokes in the smoker and cook for 1½ to 1¾ hours, until the leaves are deeply bronzed and have loosened somewhat. Remove the artichokes from the smoker and steam them over boiling water until very tender, 25 to 30 minutes. The artichokes can be eaten warm or chilled. Serve whole, accompanied by Golden Mustard Barbecue sauce or vinaigrette dressing, if you wish.
