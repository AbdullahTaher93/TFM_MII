Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a food processor, combine the cookies, coconut, and sugar, and process until crumbly. Pour in the butter and process just to combine. Pat the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch spring form pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until lightly set. Put the crust aside to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 300°F. In a food processor or electric mixer, combine the cream cheese, cream of coconut, and coconut. By hand, stir in the eggs, one at a time until fully incorporated, and then add the vanilla. Pour the filling into the crust. Fill a baking pan or dish with water and place it on the lowest rack in the oven. Bake the cheesecake on the center rack for 1 hour, or until lightly set. Let the cake sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes, then cover it and chill for at least 1 hour. Remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator. In a small, heavy saucepan, melt together the topping ingredients. Remove the mixture from the heat and spread it gently over the top of the cheesecake. Return the cheesecake to the refrigerator for at least 3 more hours or overnight. Before serving, allow the cheesecake to sit for 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature. Remove the spring form sides from the pan. Slice the cheesecake with a warm knife, to cut through the chocolate topping most easily, and serve.
