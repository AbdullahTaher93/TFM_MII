Preheat the oven to 325°F. Spray a roasting pan with nonstick vegetable cooking spray (this will make cleanup easier) or line the pan with foil. If you have a roasting rack, spray it as well and place it in the pan. Place the ham on top. If you don’t have a rack, just place the ham in the pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the center of the ham. Combine all the remaining ingredients and mix well. Brush the ham with the glaze and bake for 1¼ hours, basting every 30 minutes, until the thermometer reads 140°F. Remove the ham to a carving board and let it stand for 15 minutes before cutting. Suggested accompaniments: Noodle Pudding or sweet potatoes and coleslaw. Ham Sandwiches: Variations on a Theme If you are used to making sandwiches with that boring thin-sliced ham from the deli, making them with your own leftover baked ham will be a remarkable revelation. Bread-wise, try an onion roll, pumpernickel or dark rye bread, whole-wheat pita, or a cheese croissant. Spread with mustard—grainy, honey, or Dijon—or Major Grey’s Mango Chutney (available in the condiment section of the grocery store). Add a slice of Cheddar, Brie, or goat cheese. Top with sprouts, thick slice of tomato, Bermuda onion, or slices of apples, or pears. Enjoy!
