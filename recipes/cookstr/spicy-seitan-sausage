Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, combine the gluten flour and Spicy Seasoning Blend. Drizzle ½ cup of oil over the surface of the seasoned flour and mix well with a fork. Slowly pour the water over this mixture while stirring rapidly until the gluten dough is moist. Knead well to blend the seasonings. Divide the gluten into 4 pieces, rolling each piece into an 8- to 9-inch-long “rope.” Flatten, then roll each “rope” into a long cylinder. To maintain this shape during the cooking stage, wrap cotton string in a spiral fashion around each cylinder. In a heavy, flame-and ovenproof casserole (see Notes) with a lid, heat the Basic Broth on the stovetop until the broth begins to boil. Reduce the heat to low, add the gluten, and summer 20-30 minutes. Transfer the casserole dish to the oven for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 275°F, and continue to oven-braise the gluten, turning the links every 20 minutes until most of the broth has been absorbed (45-60 minutes). When you ave turned the links for the last time, drizzle 1 teaspoon of oil over each. Uncover and bake the sausages, turning them every minutes for even browning. Very little broth should remain. Remove the dish from the oven and allow the seitan to cool completely before carefully removing the string. Enjoy as you would any sausage. Variation: For hickory sausage, add 2 teaspoons of liquid hickory-smoke flavoring to the Basic Broth. This natural flavoring is found in natural foods stores and most supermarkets. If a less salty or unsalted seitan is required, omit part or all of the soy sauce in the broth and use only the kombu and a few slices of ginger.
