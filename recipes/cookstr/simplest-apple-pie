Mix the flour and ½ cup sugar in a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, break the butter up into bits with a fork or your fingertips. Add the egg yolks and sour cream and beat with a wooden spoon. Add to the flour mixture and stir. Add the lemon zest, if using. Use your fingers to break up lumps so the mixture has a coarse cornmeal texture. Add water a little at a time if needed to make the dough come together, blending it in, then pull the dough together into a mass. Place in a heavy plastic bag and refrigerate while you prepare the apples. Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease an 8-inch square baking pan and sprinkle the bottom generously with the bread crumbs. Peel the apples. Using a coarse grater, grate the apples; you should have about 8 cups. Place the apples in a bowl, add the lemon juice and a little sugar if you wish, and toss well. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, cut it in half, and set one half aside. Place the other half in the cake pan and press it evenly to cover the bottom; it will be less than ¼ inch thick. Pile on the grated apples, mounding them up in the middle; the pile will look high, but it will shrink during baking. Crumble the reserved dough over the apples to cover. Bake for 1 hour, or until the top of the pie is touched with golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.
