In a stand mixer or large bowl, cream the butter and orange zest until fluffy. Beat in the maple syrup. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until well mixed. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, oats, and pecans. Stir into the butter mixture to make a soft dough. Chill the dough mixture for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Use a tablespoon to scoop the dough, form it into balls, and place on the sheets at least 3 inches apart. A standard baking sheet should hold 5 cookies. Bake for 6 to 7 minutes, reverse the position of the sheets, then bake for 6 to 7 minutes more, until the cookies have a dark golden edge that extends about ½ inch into the cookie. Cool for 10 minutes on the pans, then transfer to a cooling rack with a spatula to finish cooling completely.
