Grease well and flour pans for 4 dozen madeleines. If only half this many pans are available, cut the recipe in half and make it again. This is because the butter, on standing, settles to the bottom and causes a heavy rough layer. Place racks near the bottom of the oven and preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Beat the eggs with the salt, adding sugar gradually, until the mixture stands in very stiff peaks. Add vanilla. Sift about one quarter of the flour at a time over the egg mixture and fold it in until no flour shows. Add the butter about a tablespoon at a time and fold it in as quickly as possible. Fill the prepared pans about three quarters full, place in oven immediately and bake until brown, about 10 minutes.
