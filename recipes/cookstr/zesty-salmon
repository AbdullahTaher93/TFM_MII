Rub the salmon with olive oil and place it on an oiled heavy sheet pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste and let sit 30 minutes to improve the flavor. Meanwhile, place the remaining ingredients in a small bowl and stir well to combine. Preheat the broiler and adjust the rack so itâ€™s 3 inches from the heat source. Spread the mayonnaise in a thin layer over the salmon. Broil 7 minutes, or until the fish is opaque at its thickest point. Serve immediately or at room temperature.
