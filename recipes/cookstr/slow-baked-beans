Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 250°F. Set the beans in a large Dutch oven or lidded casserole. Sprinkle with salt. Pour enough boiling water over them to cover by 2 inches. Cover and bake until the beans are tender, 1 to 4 hours, depending on size and condition. (Most beans take 2 to 3 hours, but an occasional batch can surprise you.) Add boiling water, if needed, to keep the beans covered. If you like the way the cooking liquid tastes, reserve it when you drain the beans. Refrigerate the beans for up to 3 days, or freeze until needed (see Freezing Cooked Beans opposite). Other Ideas: Freezing Cooked Beans: After the beans have cooled, freeze them in heavy, zipper-topped plastic bags. It’s convenient to store them in 1¾-cup quantities, the approximate amount contained in a 15-ounce can, and the amount I call for in recipes. Defrost frozen beans either at room temperature or in a microwave. Bonus Bean Broth: Cook the beans with 1 chunked carrot, 2 sliced celery ribs, 1 large bay leaf, 1 halved shallot or small onion, 1 or 2 crushed cloves of garlic (optional), and 1/8 teaspoon peppercorns. Remove and discard the vegetables after draining the beans. Use the broth for soups and stews. Make a tasty side dish or a spread for baguette by mashing the cooked beans coarsely with roasted garlic and olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Garnish the beans with Gremolata. See the recipe for Slow-Baked Cannellini with Olives, Escarole, and Gremolata for another approach to this technique.
