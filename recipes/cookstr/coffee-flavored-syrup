In a saucepan, bring sugar and water to a rapid boil over medium heat. Boil until sugar is dissolved, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in liqueur. Use warm or let cool. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Variation For a nutty taste, substitute almond-flavored liqueur for the coffee-flavored liqueur.
