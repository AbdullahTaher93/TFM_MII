Saut√© the shrimp over high heat in the olive oil for about 3 minutes for large, 4 minutes for jumbo. Turn the heat down to low and add the garlic. Toss or stir the shrimp with the garlic for about 30 seconds, until the garlic aroma fills the room but not enough to let it burn. Set aside and let cool, then refrigerate for at least an hour. Sprinkle the onion slices with the coarse salt and rub them between your hands until you no longer feel the salt. Drain in a colander for 15 minutes. Wring out as much liquid as you can by squeezing small bunches of the slices in your fists. Combine the mayonnaise, capers, lemon juice, dill, and parsley in a salad bowl. Add the shrimp, onion slices, and chile, and toss. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
