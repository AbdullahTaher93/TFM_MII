To Make the Dressing: Combine the tomato juice, vinegar, jalapeno, pequin chile, garlic, and oil. Whisk together, or place in a jar and shake. To Assemble the Salad: Place the spinach first in a colander and spray water over it, then place it in a salad spinner to drain. Slice the pears in half lengthwise; remove the core (but leave the peel), then cut the fruit into thing wedges. Place the spinach and shrimp in a salad bowl and toss with the dressing. Add ground pepper, if desired. To serve, divide the spinach mixture among the plates or bowls and top with the pear wedges (place pear wedges all in the same direction). Sprinkle with pi√±ons and serve.
