Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). In a bowl, combine flour, oat bran, baking powder, baking soda and sugar. Make a well in the center. In another bowl, whisk together eggs, butter and buttermilk. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moist and blended. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tin, filling half full. Add 1 heaping tbsp (15 mL) strawberry preserves. Top with the remaining batter. Sprinkle with sliced almonds. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
