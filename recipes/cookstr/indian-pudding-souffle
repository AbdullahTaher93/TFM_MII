Preheat the oven to 350° Butter and sugar the soufflé dish. Place the cornmeal in the top of the double boiler, over boiling water, and gradually add the scalded milk, stirring constantly for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, molasses, spices, salt and egg yolks. Set aside to cool slightly. In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold into the pudding mixture. Turn the batter into the prepared mold and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until puffed and brown. Serve with whipped cream.
