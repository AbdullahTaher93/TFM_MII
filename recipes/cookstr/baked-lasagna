Cook the lasagne in salted water to which you have added 2 tablespoons oil, or according to package directions. Drain well, stir in a little oil, and keep them warm over hot water. Prepare the tomato meat sauce and the bechamel with nutmeg. Blanch the sausages in boiling water 3 minutes. Drain and broil till cooked through—about 8 minutes. Peel and discard the skins. Spread a layer of the tomato sauce in the bottom of a large baking dish or pan, preferably one with sharp corners, about 9 × 12 × 3 inches. Then add layers of lasagne, sausage, ricotta cheese, and bechamel. Begin with another layer of lasagne and repeat until the ingredients are used up, reserving some bechamel for the top of the dish. Sprinkle heavily with grated Parmesan cheese and bake in a 350-degree oven 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to sit in a warm spot 10 minutes before serving. Cut in squares and serve with additional grated Parmesan cheese.
