Preheat thc oven to 375°F. Toss the fruit with ½ cup of the brown sugar, the granulated sugar, and lemon juice. Mix the remaining ¼ cup brown sugar and all other dry ingredients together. Add the butter, working it with your hands only until the ingredients begin to come together in a crumbly mixture. Spoon the fruit mixture into 4-inch ramekins, filling them about three-quarters full. Place the ramekins, on a baking tray to catch any overflow during cooking. Sprinkle the topping over the fruit and bake the crisps for approximately 25 minutes. If the topping browns too quickly, cover the ramekins with foil. Serve warm, with vanilla ice cream, if desired.
