In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine rice, broth, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. In a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add onion and saut√© until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir into rice. Add parsley and fluff with a fork before serving.
