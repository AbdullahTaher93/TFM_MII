Whisk the flour egg yolks, ¼ cup granulated sugar, and milk together in a bowl with a clean whisk until smooth. Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold into the batter. Melt 1½ tsp of the butter in an 8in (20cm) nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Pour in one-fourth of the batter and sprinkle with 1 tbsp raisins. Cook 1 minute, until the underside is browned. Turn the pancake and brown the other side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining butter, batter, and raisins. Tear the pancakes into pieces using 2 forks. Return the pancake pieces to the frying pan (or a larger one, if you have it) and sprinkle with the remaining 4 tsp sugar. Cook over medium heat about 1 minute, until piping hot. Sift confectioner's sugar on top and serve immediately, with the plum preserves on the side.
