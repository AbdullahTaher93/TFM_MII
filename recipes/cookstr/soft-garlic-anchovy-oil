Place the garlic and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat and cook over medium-high heat until the garlic is soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool. Mince the garlic and combine it with the anchovies in a small bowl. Whisk in the lemon juice and oil. Stir in the zest and use right away or set aside for up to several hours.
