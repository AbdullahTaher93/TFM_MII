The Process Place the water, soy, vinegar, sugar and sesame oil in a large sealable plastic bag or a shallow glass dish. Add chicken and marinate for 15 minutes to overnight. Heat oven to high broil (you can also grill). Remove chicken from the brine and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and coat with sesame seeds. Broil for approximately seven minutes if breasts are thin, or pounded. For thicker breasts, allow 12-15 minutes. Finish with cilantro and an extra splash of tamari (optional). Serve with gingered rice & edamame .
