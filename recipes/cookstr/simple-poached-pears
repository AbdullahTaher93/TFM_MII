Combine the wine, water, sugar, cinnamon sticks, vanilla and lemon zest in a Dutch oven; heat to a boil over high heat. Add pears to the poaching liquid; reduce heat to medium-low. If the pears are not completely submerged, add boiling water to cover. Cover pears with a circle of parchment paper; poach until easily pierced, about 30-40 minutes. Turn off heat; let pears cool in the liquid. Serve at room temperature or chilled, whole or cut in half and cored. If desired, heat poaching liquid to a boil; boil until reduced to about 1 cup. Strain the liquid; pour over pears.
