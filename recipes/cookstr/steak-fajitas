Preheat the broiler. Remove the tortillas from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature while you are preparing the fajitas. Place the steak on a broiler pan. Broil about 3 inches from the heat for 5 minutes. Turn the steak over and broil 4 minutes more until nicely browned. Transfer the steak to a platter and let it cool for about 10 minutes before slicing. Cut the steak into thin slices and set aside on a plate. Put a large frying pan on high heat and let it get very hot, about 1 minute. Add the oil and the sliced onion and bell pepper and saut√©, stirring constantly, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the steak slices and garlic and cook 1 minute more. Stir in the taco sauces and taco seasoning and cook until the mixture is heated through, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat. Transfer the steak mixture to a serving bowl. Place the tortillas on a dinner plate, and bring them to the table along with the steak mixture and grated cheese. Guests and family can assemble their own fajitas by placing a few tablespoons of steak across the middle of their tortilla, topping with grated cheese, then rolling the whole thing up.
