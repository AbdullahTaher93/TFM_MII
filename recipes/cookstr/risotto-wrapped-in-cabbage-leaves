In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the cabbage until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and set aside. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add the rice and a generous pinch of salt and cook until the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a sauté pan or skillet over high heat. Add the veal, season with a pinch of salt, and cook until the meat browns, about 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, combine the veal, rice, eggs, cheese, a pinch of salt, and a generous amount of black pepper. Stir thoroughly until it forms a smooth mixture. Pat the cabbage leaves dry and lay them out flat on a work surface. Trim away the tough mid-rib at the base of each leaf, if necessary. Put 1 tablespoon of the veal mixture in the center of each leaf. Fold the sides of the leaves toward the center and roll up from the bottom. Lightly dredge each cabbage roll in flour. Heat the ¼ cup olive oil in a large sauté pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cabbage rolls and fry on both sides until golden brown. Serve hot.
