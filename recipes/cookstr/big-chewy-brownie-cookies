Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, if you have it; otherwise leave the baking sheet ungreased. Place the butter, unsweetened chocolate, and chocolate chips in a small saucepan and melt over low heat, stirring frequently, just until everything is smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Beat the eggs and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy and light yellow, about 1 minute. Beat in the vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, blend the flour mixture into the egg mixture in 3 batches, blending after each addition, just until barely combined. Add the chocolate mixture to the bowl and beat just until combined; the dough will be very thick. Scoop out heaping tablespoons of the dough and create 12 mounds on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the tops are crackly and the edges are set, 9 to 11 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and firmly tap the pan against the counter. Let the cookies sit for 1 minute on the baking sheet (they will sink slightly), then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat to bake three sheets of cookies in all.
