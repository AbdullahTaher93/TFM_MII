Hand Method In a large bowl, using a blending fork, blend together cake flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter and blend until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add ice water, by spoonfuls, while tossing mixture with fork. Add only enough water to make dough stick together. Press dough into a ball. Flatten into a disk and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm enough to roll out for your pie, for about 20 minutes. Fill and bake according to recipe directions. Food Processor Method In a food processor fitted with metal blade, process cake and all-purpose flours, sugar and salt until combined, about 10 seconds. Remove lid and distribute butter evenly over top. Cover and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 20 times. Place water in a container with a pouring spout and, with motor running, slowly pour through the feed tube in a steady stream just until dough begins to gather. You may not use all the water, which is fine. Turn out dough onto a clean surface and gather into a ball. Proceed with Step 3 above. Variations: Flaky Pie Pastry Dough: Replace butter with cold vegetable shortening. You can double this recipe for a double-crust pie. Just be careful when you add the water as you will not need twice, as much as single-crust recipe.
