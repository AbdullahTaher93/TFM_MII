Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cut the chocolate, with a sharp knife, into pieces approximately Â½ inch in size. With 1 tablespoon of butter, lightly grease 2 cookie sheets. Lightly flour them with 1 tablespoon of flour and shake off the excess. Cream the butter together with sugars and salt until light and creamy looking. Beat in the egg, coffee and walnut oil. Stir in the flour and beat until just combined. Add the cut-up chocolate and walnuts.* Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of batter, per cookie, onto the prepared cookie sheets. You should get about 10 cookies per sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on a cookie rack.
