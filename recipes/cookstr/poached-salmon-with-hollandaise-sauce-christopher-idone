Wash the fish thoroughly and place the tarragon in the cavity. Wrap the fish tightly in lengths of plastic wrap. Place the fish in a poacher, add the court bouillon and enough water to cover. When the liquid begins to bubble, reduce the heat to low and simmer slowly for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the fish to cool. Remove the fish to a platter and carefully remove the plastic wrap. Peel away the skin and dark flesh to reveal the salmon flesh. Blot away excess juices. Arrange the vegetables on either side of the fish and serve with Hollandaise Sauce.
