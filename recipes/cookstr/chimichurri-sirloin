At least 2 hours and up to the night before you plan to smoke the sirloin, combine the dry rub ingredients together in a small bowl. Rub the steaks well with the mixture, wrap them in plastic, and refrigerate them for at least 1½ hours. Make the chimichurri, stirring together the ingredients in a small bowl. Refrigerate the sauce until needed. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. In a heavy skillet, sear the sirloins quickly over high heat. Transfer the steaks to the smoker and cook to your desired doneness. Most people prefer the meat medium-rare, when the internal temperature reaches 145 F to 150 F, which takes about 50 to 60 minutes at a cooking temperature of 225° F to 250° F. Serve the steaks hot, accompanied with the sauce.
