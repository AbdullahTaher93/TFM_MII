Prepare a medium-hot grill. The coals should be ashed over, with no visible flames. While the grill is heating, prepare the corn and tomato mixture. Use a sharp knife to cut the kernels from the ears, scraping and saving any of the liquid from the cobs with the kernels. Strip the marjoram leaves from the stems, reserving the stems for another use. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the butter over low heat. Add the shallot with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden, about 8 minutes. Add the corn and its liquid, the marjoram leaves, and salt and pepper to taste. Raise the heat to high and cook, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook just until they are warm but do not break down, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Season the squid with salt and pepper and toss with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Grill over the hot coals, turning once or twice, until the squid is opaque and shows a few grill marks, 2 to 3 minutes total. Avoid overcooking, as the squid will become tough. Divide the corn and tomato mixture among 4 warmed plates. Top each with grilled squid and a drizzle of olive oil and serve.
