Cut the ends off the pumpkin and place it on a flat surface. Using a serrated knife, gently saw down the length of the pumpkin to remove the peel. Cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Cut the pumpkin into ½-inch pieces. Set aside. Peel the persimmons and remove the tops. Cut into ½-inch pieces, removing any seeds. Set aside. Heat the olive oil and butter in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-low heat. When the foaming subsides, add the onion, bay leaf, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the carrots, and stir to combine. Cook until the carrots begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the pumpkin and salt and pepper to taste and stir to coat with the fat. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the stock and raise the heat to medium-high. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and add the persimmons. Simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaf. Working in batches, transfer the soup to a food processor or blender and blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot and bring back to a boil. If the soup seems too thick, adjust the consistency with a little stock. Stir in the cream. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the vinegar. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve in warmed bowls.
