Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and pour into a small bowl. Leave the oven on. While the almonds are in the oven, make the brown butter syrup: In a 10-inch skillet, melt the butter over high heat and cook, without stirring, until it browns, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the bay leaf and stand back (it might pop). Reduce the heat to medium, add the sugar, and stir. When the sugar has melted, add the brandy and stand back (it might flame). Add the lemon juice. Cook for 15 seconds, then add the orange juice and ¼ teaspoon salt. Stir and cook until the liquid has reduced by half and has a syrupy consistency, about 3 minutes. You should have about ½ cup. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Using a serrated knife, shave off the thicker parts of the crust from the bread loaf. Cut the bread into ½-inch cubes. You should have about 8 cups. Place the bread in a large bowl, add ¼ cup of the brown butter syrup, and toss to coat evenly. Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake the bread cubes, turning occasionally for even coloring, until golden and crispy on the outside and still chewy inside, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. While the bread cubes are cooling, in a bowl, combine the strawberries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, and ½ teaspoon salt and mix well. Allow to macerate for 5 to 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the raisins with hot water to cover. Allow the raisins to plump for 8 to 10 minutes, then drain well. Place the toasted bread in a large bowl. Add the remaining ¼ cup brown butter syrup, the toasted almonds, raisins, blueberries, and mint and toss well. To serve, spoon some strawberries in each bowl. Spoon some of the bread mixture alongside the berries, and spoon some whipped cream over the strawberries.
