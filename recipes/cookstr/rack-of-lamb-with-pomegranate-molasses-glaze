Preheat grill to medium-high Place lamb on baking sheet. Rub well with olive oil and herb mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow lamb to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before grilling. Place lamb fat-side down on grill. Cook, turning racks every 5 to 7 minutes, for 15 to 25 minutes. During the last 4 to 6 minutes of grilling time, brush racks with pomegranate molasses, turning racks so they donâ€™t darken too much in any one spot. Remove from grill; let stand for 5 minutes before dividing into individual chops. Serve immediately.
