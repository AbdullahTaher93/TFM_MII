Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok over high heat. Add the shallots, bell pepper, celery, and garlic and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add the bean sprouts, stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the shrimp and stir-fry for 1 minute, or until the shrimp turn pink. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Add the beaten eggs, stirring until well combined. Wash the wok and wipe dry with paper towels. Return the wok to high heat and pour in 2in (5cm) oil. When the oil is hot, ladle ¼ of the mixture into the oil. Fry about 2 minutes, until the underside is lightly browned, spooning a little of the hot oil over the eggs so the top starts to set. Carefully turn the egg cake over and cook 1 minute, until lightly browned on the other side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Keep warm in a 200°F (95°C) oven while making the remaining cakes. Meanwhile, mix the stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and rice wine in a saucepan. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tbsp cold water, and stir into the stock mixture. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly until thickened; simmer for 1 minute. Serve the cakes with the sauce and rice.
