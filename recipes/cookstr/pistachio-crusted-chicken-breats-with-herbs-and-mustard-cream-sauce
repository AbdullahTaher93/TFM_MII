Preheat oven to 400°F. Trim chicken and pound between two sheets of plastic wrap to an even ¼-inch thickness. Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. In a small bowl stir together the mustard, basil and dill. Spread over the chicken breasts. Combine pistachio nuts and Panko in a shallow dish. Coat chicken well with pistachio mixture. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add two chicken breasts and cook 2 minutes per side to brown the nuts-do not burn. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and repeat with remaining chicken breasts. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. For sauce place wine or broth in a medium skillet and stir in shallots. Bring to a boil and cook until most liquid cooks away, about 4 minutes. Lower heat to medium. Add the cream and simmer until reduced slightly and thickened, about 2 minutes. Whisk in mustard, basil and dill and simmer 2 minutes to blend flavors. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve sauce spooned over chicken.
