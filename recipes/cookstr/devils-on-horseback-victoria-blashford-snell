Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Mix the chutney, mustard, and cayenne, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Make a small slit in each dried plum and stuff with a little of the chutney mixture. Wrap each with a bacon strip and secure with a toothpick. Place the wrapped dried plums on an oiled baking sheet. Bake for 10–12 minutes, turning them after 5 minutes, until the bacon is crisp. Meanwhile, toast the bread. Remove the crusts, and using a 2 in (5cm) cookie cutter, cut out 12 rounds. Butter the toast rounds and top each one with a bacon-wrapped plum. Sprinkle each with a little cayenne pepper and serve warm. Variation Angels on Horseback Replace the prunes with 16 shucked oysters, and leave out the chutney. Lightly season the oysters with black pepper, then wrap a strip of bacon around each, securing it with a toothpick.
