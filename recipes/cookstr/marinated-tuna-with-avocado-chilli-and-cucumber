Slice the tuna thinly and place in a large shallow serving dish. Sprinkle with salt and cover with the lime juice. Leave to marinate for 40 minutes, turning the fish over once. Lift out the fish (which should now look opaque from being “cooked” by the lime juice) and put on a plate. Pour the resultant juices into a small bowl. Return the tuna to the dish in a presentable manner. Scatter over the onion and chillies. Arrange the tomatoes, cucumber, and avocado over the top. Sprinkle the cilantro leaves over the surface and finish with the olive oil. Finally, return the collected juices to the dish using a spoon, taking particular care to fully anoint each and every piece of avocado, so preventing any discoloration. Cover and chill for a further 40 minutes or so before serving. Hand round a dish of sour cream at table.
