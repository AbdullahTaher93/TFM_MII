In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add brown sugar, corn syrup and salt. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Once boiling, it will look like bubbling lava. Boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in cream. Add chocolate chips and whisk until melted and smooth. The sauce will look like itâ€™s separating but will smooth out after a minute or so of whisking. The sauce will thicken as it cools. Serve warm.
