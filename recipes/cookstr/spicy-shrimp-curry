Throw the first 10 ingredients into a food processor and whizz up to a fine paste. Pour a little oil into a hot wok or casserole-type pan, add the green beans and baby corn and stir fry for 30 seconds. Add the curry paste and coconut milk, bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Season with soy sauce, add the shrimp and cook for 1 minute (if using frozen shrimp, add them 2 minutes before the end of cooking time). Serve immediately with some light, fluffy rice.
