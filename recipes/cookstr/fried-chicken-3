Wash chicken. Pat dry with paper towels. For marinade, combine buttermilk, 1 tablespoon of the salt, 1 tablespoon of the pepper, hot pepper sauce, and garlic. Place chicken in a large container. Pour marinade over chicken. Cover and marinate in refrigerator for 24 hours. In a shallow dish combine flour, the remaining 1 tablespoon salt, the remaining 1 tablespoon pepper, garlic powder, mustard, paprika, chili powder, and cumin. Take a pinch of the flour mixture and taste it-it should be a bit salty and peppery. Drain chicken but do not wipe off. Coat the chicken pieces with the flour mixture. Preheat oven to 350°F. Place a cooling rack in a large baking sheet or jelly roll pan. Set aside. Pour oil into a deep, heavy pot. The oil should not reach more than half way up the side of the pot. Heat over high heat to 350°F. Reduce heat to medium. Place the chicken, one piece at a time, in the hot oil. (Be very careful, as the oil will boil up and you don't want it to overflow.) Fry chicken, 3 or 4 pieces at a time, until golden brown. Remove chicken from oil and place on cooling rack. Once all the chicken has been fried, transfer the baking sheet or jellyroll pan holding the cooling rack to the oven. (This will help crisp the batter on the chicken and let much of the oil drain from the chicken.) Bake until fully cooked (180°F), about 20 minutes.
