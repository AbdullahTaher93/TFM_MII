Fill a stockpot or 8-quart pot with salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Plunge the lobsters headfirst into the boiling water, cover, and cook 12 to 14 minutes. Carefully remove the lobsters from the pot. Allow them to cool somewhat, and remove the meat from the shells (see Notes). Before serving, in a medium saucepan, heat the stock over medium-high heat until it is hot to the touch but not boiling. Add the lobster meat and heat through, 5 to 10 minutes, and drain. Be careful not to overheat; if the meat gets too hot, it will curl up. To serve: Bring the curry sauce to a boil over medium heat. Divide the heated lobster meat among 4 plates and spoon curry sauce on top. Garnish with the herbs, if desired.
