Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring often, until soft and the onions are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, beat the egg in a medium-size bowl and stir in the groats, mixing until all the grains are coated. (This will help prevent the granules from sticking, but you will still need to break them up when toasting.) Spread the egg-coated groats on a baking sheet or in a shallow pan. Place it in the oven, and bake, stirring often to separate the grains and prevent burning, until all the grains are dry, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and separate the groats. Add the stock to the onion mixture, arid stir in the toasted groats. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and cook until the groats are tender and the water has been absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. (If the groats are tender after 10 minutes, uncover the pan and continue cooking.) Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the bowtie pasta and cook until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the pasta and stir it into the kasha. Serve immediately.
