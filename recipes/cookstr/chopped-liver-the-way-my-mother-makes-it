Preheat broiler with rack about 3 inches from heat source. Rinse livers and pat dry on paper towels; cut off any green spots. Put livers on foil-lined broiler rack and sprinkle with kosher salt. Broil 3 minutes or until livers brown lightly on top. Turn them over, sprinkle second side with salt, and broil 3 to 4 more minutes or until cooked through and color is no longer pink; check by cutting with a sharp knife. Discard juices from foil. Cool livers slightly. Heat oil in large, heavy skillet. Add onions and saut√© over medium-low heat, stirring often, about 15 minutes or until tender and well browned. Chop the liver in a food processor. Add onions and chop with brief pulses until blended in. Transfer to a bowl and lightly mix in eggs. Season well with salt and pepper. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve, up to 2 days. Serve cold, in scoops on lettuce leaves and garnished with tomato slices, if using.
