For the asparagus: In a large pot of boiling salted water over high heat, blanch the asparagus until bright green and still crisp, 3 to 4 minutes, and shock in a bowl of ice water. Remove it by grasping the stems, rather than the tips. Cut off the tips about 3 inches from the top and halve lengthwise. Thinly slice the remaining stems. For the pasta: In a large pot of boiling salted water over high heat, cook the pasta until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold running water. Lightly drizzle with olive oil. To serve: In a medium skillet or saut√© pan, bring the mushroom cream to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce the heat to medium and simmer until it reduces slightly. Add the cooked pennette and toss until, heated through. Add the asparagus and lobster and heat through. Add the optional truffle juice and chopped chives. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Divide among 4 to 6 bowls. Variation: For pennette, substitute penne, small tortellini, or cavatelli.
