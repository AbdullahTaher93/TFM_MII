Add the pasta to a large pot of boiling salted water. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cook until tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain, reserving ½ cup of the pasta water. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for 30 seconds or until golden. Add the bell pepper and sauté for 2 minutes or until it becomes slightly tender. Add the chard and sauté for 2 minutes, or until the chard is tender but retains its bright color. Add the tomatoes and heat through. Add the nutritional yeast and the reserved pasta water. Stir and heat the sauce until it comes together. Check for seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the reserved pasta, basil, and lemon zest. Serve immediately garnished with pine nuts, if using.
