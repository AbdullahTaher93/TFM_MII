In the workbowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the anchovies, garlic, green/spring onions, parsley, cilantro/fresh coriander, dill, tarragon, basil, vinegar, salt, sugar, and pepper until finely chopped. Stop the machine once or twice to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the sour cream and mayonnaise. Process until smooth. Transfer to a serving bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld.
