Toast the cumin seeds: Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the cumin and toast, stirring and shaking the pan constantly to prevent burning. Watch carefully, for the seeds will brown quickly. (Lower the heat if the cumin appears to be browning too quickly.) Toast just until the cumin fills the kitchen with its fragrance and turns dark brown, about 4 minutes total. Immediately transfer the cumin seeds to a plate to cool. In a large skillet, heat the oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the carrots, garlic, sugar, and toasted cumin seeds. Add enough water to cover the carrots by half. Add the bouquet garni and salt to taste. Butter a piece of wax paper, poke several holes in the paper, and place it, butter side down, on top of the carrots. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 25 minutes. Remove and discard the wax paper and the bouquet garni. Add the orange juice and cook over low heat, uncovered, stirring from time to time, until almost all the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. At serving time, stir in the butter. Taste for seasoning and serve.
