Remove the spinach from its packaging and place it in a microwave-safe dish. Microwave, uncovered, on high power until defrosted, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a 4Â½-quart Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Peel and finely chop the onion, adding it to the pot as you chop. Add the garlic. Cook, stirring, until the onion is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 2 cups water and the broth; raise the heat to high and bring the soup to a boil. Remove the spinach from the microwave and drain it well, squeezing out the excess water. Add it to the pot. Add the tomatoes with their juice and the sugar. Stir to mix well. Add the tortellini and bring the soup back to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, maintaining a slow boil, and cook until the pasta is just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the Parmesan cheese, salt, black pepper, and egg in a small bowl and stir vigorously with a fork or a small whisk. Set aside. When the pasta is tender, slowly drizzle the egg mixture over the soup, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Then remove the pot from the heat, spoon the soup into shallow bowls, and serve.
