Heat a large skillet over medium heat, then swirl in the oil. Add the garlic and cook just until frizzling well at the edges, no more than 30 seconds. Toss in the shallot and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring often, until softened and very aromatic, no more than 2 minutes. Add the prosciutto crudo pieces and continue cooking and stirring until theyâ€™re browned at the edges, about 2 minutes. Pour in the peas and continue cooking for 1 minute. Then add the broth and bring the sauce to a substantial simmer. Add the cooked pasta and toss well so that everything gets mixed up in the noodles. Sprinkle in the cheese and pepper. Toss just until the cheese melts and coats the noodles.
