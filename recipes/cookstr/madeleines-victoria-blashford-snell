Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Carefully brush the indentations of the madeleine pan with melted butter. Dust with flour and tap to remove the excess. Beat the sugar, eggs, and vanilla with an electric mixer on high speed for 4 minutes, until the mixture triples in volume and forms a ribbon when the beaters are lifted. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together twice. Sift the flour mixture over the egg mixture. Pour the butter down the inside of the bowl. Using a spatula, fold gently together, keeping the batter light and airy. Spoon the batter into the molds. Bake for 12 minutes, or until golden. Unmold and cool completely. Sift confectioner's sugar over the tops just before serving.
