In a 4½-quart saucepan, heat ½ tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic. Saute for 5 minutes, or until translucent. Add the carrots, coriander, and paprika to the saucepan and stir until well blended. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the broth to the saucepan, cover partially, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Transfer the vegetables to a blender, process them until smooth, and return them to the saucepan, or use a hand blender directly in the saucepan. In a 1½-quart saucepan, heat the remaining tablespoon of butter over medium-low heat. Add the flour and stir until well blended. Add the milk and stir until thickened. Add the mixture to the soup. Add the cream, salt, and pepper to the soup and stir until well blended. Top with a sprinkle of parsley or cilantro and serve.
