Pat the chops dry with a kitchen towel and then flatten slightly by beating with the blunt side of a knife or with a meat mallet. Place them in a bowl. Stir the turmeric into the yogurt, rub the mixture on the chops, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and put in the refrigerator to marinate for 1 hour. Place a nonstick saucepan over medium heat and add 2 teaspoons of the oil. When small bubbles appear at the bottom of the pan, add one third of the onions, the ginger, garlic, chiles, cilantro, coriander, peppercorns, fennel, half the cinnamon, 4 of the cloves, and 2 of the cardamom pods, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until fragrant. Cool and place in a food processor with 2 tablespoons water. Process to a fine paste. Place another nonstick saucepan over medium heat and add the remaining oil. When small bubbles appear at the bottom of the pan, add the bay leaves, remaining cinnamon, remaining cloves, remaining cardamom pods, and remaining onions. Sauté for 4 to 5 minutes or until the onions are lightly browned. Add the ground spice mixture and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chops and continue to sauté for 8 minutes or until the chops are well covered with the spices and the oil comes to the top. Add 1 cup (200 ml) water and the salt, and stir well. Add the ghee and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently. Add another ½ cup (100 ml) water if the lamb is not yet cooked through. Continue to cook for 1 hour or until the lamb is tender. Uncover and simmer until the sauce is thick. Sprinkle with the lemon juice and serve immediately.
