To make the pastry, cut the butter into pieces and rub into the flour with your fingertips, then mix in the egg to give a firm dough. Roll out and use to line a 9- to 9½-inch (22 to 24cm) shallow tart pan. Leave to rest in the fridge for a good twenty minutes. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

Roll out and use to line a 9- to 9½-inch (22 to 24cm) shallow tart pan. Leave to rest in the fridge for a good twenty minutes. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Cover the pastry shell with parchment paper and fill with dried beans or ceramic pie weights. Cook in the preheated oven for about ten minutes, until the pastry is lightly biscuit colored. Carefully remove the paper and beans and return the pastry shell to the oven for five minutes, until dry to the touch. For the filling, melt the butter in a small pan, add the honey and sugar, and then pour in the cream and a couple of drops of vanilla extract. Boil hard for two minutes, then remove from the heat and lightly fold in the chopped chocolate and walnuts. Pour the filling into the tart shell. Turn the oven down to 375°F (190°C) and bake for twenty minutes, until golden. Remove and leave to cool for a good half hour before serving with creme fraiche.
