Wash rapini. Trim and discard thick stalks. Roughly chop thinner stalks and leaves, keeping the little florets intact. Set aside. In a skillet heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes or until softened. Stir in anchovies, mashing with the back of a spoon until paste-like. Stir in red pepper flakes, if using. Set sauce aside and keep warm. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in coarse salt and chopped rapini; cook for 3 minutes. Stir in pasta; cook until pasta is tender but firm. Drain; transfer pasta and rapini to a warmed serving bowl. Toss with sauce and grated cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, sprinkled with additional grated cheese, if desired.
