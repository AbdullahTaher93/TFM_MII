In a bowl, combine raisins, candied fruit, orange peel, candied ginger and orange and lemon zests. Add brandy and stir well. Set aside for 1 hour. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, bread crumbs, ground almonds, cinnamon, baking powder, nutmeg and salt. Set aside. In a clean bowl, beat brown sugar and butter until creamy. Beat in eggs and molasses until incorporated. Stir in soaked fruit mixture. Add flour mixture and mix just until blended. Spoon batter into prepared dish. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand in refrigerator for 1 week, spooning additional brandy over the top two or three times in 1-tbsp (15 ml) increments. Remove plastic wrap. Cover with foil and secure with string. Place dish in slow cooker stoneware and pour in enough boiling water to come 1 inch (2.5 cm) up the sides of the dish. Cover and cook on High for 4 hours, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the pudding comes out clean. Serve hot.
