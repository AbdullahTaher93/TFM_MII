In a juicer, juice the celery root and the apple and add both to a Vita Mix or high speed blender with the cashews, lemon juice, and yeast. Blend until completely smooth, adding water if necessary to thin it to a creamy sauce consistency. Add the truffle paste, salt, and pepper, to taste. Place the squash in a colander, toss with about Â½ teaspoon sea salt, and let sit for at least 30 minutes to allow a bit of the liquid to drain out. Place the squash in a medium bowl. Finely julienne about half of the truffle slices and add to the squash along with the peas and chives. Add a ladleful or two of sauce-enough to lightly coat the squash-season with pepper and toss. Divide the squash pasta among 4 shallow serving bowls and spoon the remaining sauce around it. In a small bowl, toss the remaining truffle slices with the oil, lemon juice, and a pinch of sea salt. Arrange the slices around the pasta. Garnish with the chervil.
