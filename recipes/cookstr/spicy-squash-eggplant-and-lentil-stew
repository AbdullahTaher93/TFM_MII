Put the split peas and lentils in a large soup pot along with 4½ cups of the water. Bring to a boil and skim well. Then add the garlic, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, cayenne, cloves, bay leaves, chiles, and salt. Turn the heat down and simmer, covered, until the legumes are tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. Stir every now and then to prevent the dal from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Add the tomatoes, squash, eggplant, onion, corn, spinach, and the remaining 2 cups of water. Return the stew to a boil, turn the heat down, and simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender but still hold their shape, about 15 minutes. Take the stew off the heat. For the tempering oil, heat the oil with the mustard seeds, if using, in a medium frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat. Cover and cook until you hear the mustard seeds crackle, 1 to 2 minutes. (Or heat the oil in the same pan over medium-high heat.) Add the chopped onion and the cumin and cook, stirring, until the onion is well browned around the edges, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium, add the garlic, and cook a few seconds. Now add the cilantro and stir. Add the lemon juice, remove from the heat, and scrape the tempering oil into the stew. Stir dal well and taste for salt. If the stew is a bit thick (it should have a lightly thickened, velvety consistency), add ¼ to ½ cup water. Spoon into a serving bowl and serve hot.
