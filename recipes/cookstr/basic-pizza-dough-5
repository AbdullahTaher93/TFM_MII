Fill the metal bowl of an electric stand mixer with hot water then pour it out and dry. This will warm the bowl. In the warmed bowl, make a sponge by mixing the yeast with ½ cup warm (100° to 110°F) water; stir until the yeast is dissolved. Stir in 1 cup of flour. The mixture will be very thick and stiff. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Add 1 cup warm (100° to 110°F) water, the milk, oil, and salt. Attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and turn on low. Slowly add the remaining 3½ cups flour and mix into a soft dough. Change to the dough hook and knead for about 15 minutes. The dough should be sticky. Form the dough into a ball. (If it is too sticky; put a few drops of oil on your hands first.) Transfer to an oiled bowl. Turn the dough to coat the top. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until it has doubled in volume, about 1½ hours. Punch down the dough, knead a few times, and reshape into a ball. Return to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough sit until nearly doubled, about 40 minutes. The dough is now ready to use.
