Preheat the oven to 400°F, Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on 2 rimmed baking sheets. Toast in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F. To prepare the chestnuts, using a sharp paring knife, make a long slash on the flat side of each chestnuts, cutting through the outer shell and inner skin. Spread the chestnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Every 15 minutes, sprinkle the chestnuts with a little water. Peel the chestnuts while they are still quite warm but cool enough to handle. Using the paring knife, remove the outer shells and the inner brown skins. Discard any chestnuts that look rotten. Set any chestnuts that are hard to peel, then rewarm them in the 375°F oven for 2 to 3 minutes or place them on a paper towel and microwave on high for 45 seconds. Repeat as needed until easy to peel. You should have about 2 cups peeled nuts. Break all the chestnut meats into small chunks and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Coat a deep, 9-by-13-inch baking pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Place the bread cubes and chestnuts in a very large bowl. In large sauté pan, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Swirl to coat the pan and add the onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté, stirring frequently, until the onion is soft and just beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the apples and sauté for 2 minutes longer. Add the parsley, thyme, sage, salt, and a few grinds of pepper and sauté for 1 minute longer. Add the apple mixture to the bread cubes and stir to combine. Add the eggs and stock to the bowl and mix well. Scoop the stuffing into the prepared pan and bake, uncovered, for about 1 hour until the top is lightly browned and crusty. If you have room in your oven, bake the stuffing while the turkey is roasting. Otherwise, bake it beforehand and reheat it once the turkey is out.
