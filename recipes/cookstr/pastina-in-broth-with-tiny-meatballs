Combine the bread crumbs and milk in a small bowl and set aside. In a medium-size bowl, mix the chuck, cheese, lemon zest, salt, and cloves just enough to combine the ingredients. Gently mix in the breadcrumb- and-milk mixture. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Form tiny meatballs using about ½ teaspoon of the mixture and roll each ball between the palms of your hands. To keep your hands from sticking, dip them in water occasionally. Place the meatballs in an 8-inch baking pan or dish; bake them for 6 to 8 minutes, then remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper-towel-lined dish to drain. Meanwhile, bring the chicken broth to a boil in a 1 pot. Stir in the pastina and cook until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the meatballs, lower the heat to medium, and cook about 3 minutes longer. Serve immediately with additional grated cheese if desired.
