Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. In batches, stir in the spinach, wilting each batch before adding more. Sprinkle the spinach with 1 tablespoon water, cover, and cook until the spinach is tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, rinse, and cool. A handful at a time, squeeze the excess liquid from the spinach. Chop coarsely. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks and red pepper and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Cool completely. Combine the spinach, cooled vegetables, sour cream, mayonnaise, dill, and cayenne in a food processor and process until blended. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and cover tightly. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours, or up to 2 days. Serve chilled.
