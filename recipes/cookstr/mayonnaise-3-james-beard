To make mayonnaise by hand, beat the egg yolks, salt, and mustard in a bowl with an electric hand mixer or wire whisk until the yolks become thick and sticky. Gradually beat in the oil, drop by drop, until the mayonnaise starts to thicken and stiffen, then beat in the remaining oil more rapidly, making sure it is incorporated before adding more. When all the oil is beaten in, beat in the lemon juice. Remove to a covered jar or bowl and refrigerate. It will keep for up to 10 days in the refrigerator.
