Whisk together the dressing ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. Bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil. Add the beans, bring the water back to a boil, and cook beans for 3 to 4 minutes, or until bright green. Do not overcook. Drain immediately and plunge beans into a bowl of ice water to refresh. Drain, pat dry, and set aside. Rub each quail with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Grill over very hot coals on a lightly oiled grill, turning occasionally, until the skin is golden brown and the breast meat is barely pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside, covered, to keep warm. Heat the butter and remaining olive oil in a skillet. Sauté the mushrooms until soft, then add 1 tablespoon dressing and quickly warm. Toss the lettuces with just enough dressing to lightly coat the leaves. Toss in most of the beans, reserving 4 little bundles for garnish. Sprinkle in the mushrooms, working quickly so the greens don’t wilt. Arrange the greens on 4 plates. Place a quail, breast side up, in the center. Place a bundle of beans at the base of each plate. Sprinkle with toasted pecans.
