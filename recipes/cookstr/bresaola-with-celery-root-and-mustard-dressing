Make the dressing first. In a bowl, whisk together the mustard, vinegar, sugar, and both oils until combined. Add the cream and whisk gently for 20 seconds just to incorporate-if you beat it too much it will thicken and separate. Peel and slice the celery root, then cut it into thin strips-as thin as linguine. Alternatively, you can shred it on a mandoline. Gently mix the dressing with the celery root and parsley. Lay the bresaola out on four serving plates. Wind the celery root strips around a fork, as if you were eating spaghetti, and place them in the center of the bresaola. Sprinkle each plate with olive oil and serve with a wedge of lemon.
