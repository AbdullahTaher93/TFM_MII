Preheat the broiler and line the rack with aluminum foil. Broil the swordfish 3 minutes on one side, turn, top with the olives, and broil 4 minutes longer. In the meantime, pour the oil into a saut√© pan and cook the onion and garlic until they are soft. Add the oregano and capers. Cook and drain the pasta. When the fish is cooked, take it out of the broiler and cut it into thin strips. Spoon it and the olives, with the onion-caper mixture, over freshly cooked pasta and toss gently.
