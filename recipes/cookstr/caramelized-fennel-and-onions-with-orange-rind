Cut each fennel bulb in half, remove stalks and root ends, and cut into 1?4-inch slices. Combine with the sliced onion. Add salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter together in a large skillet over a medium heat. Add the fennel and onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until theyâ€™re caramelized. Zest then juice the orange. Add juice to the fennel and onion mixture and stir. Garnish with fronds and orange zest. Serve immediately.
