Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch heavy-duty or cast-iron skillet over medium heat and add the salami. Saut√© slowly until the salami begins to brown and caramelize slightly on the surface. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the garlic softens without browning. Raise the heat slightly. Immediately add the clams and white wine to the pan with the garlic and salami. Bring the wine to a simmer. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula or spoon to deglaze, loosening any browned bits. Add the chicken stock and continue to cook over medium-high heat, bringing the mixture to a steady simmer until all of the clam shells have opened. Reduce the heat to low and discard any clams that have failed to open. Add the bits of butter to the pan and stir them into the mixture. Taste and adjust the seasoning with pepper. Add salt if you like, but sparingly since the salami contributes salt to the flavor of this dish. Spoon into 6 small shallow bowls and top each with 1 slice of the toasted bread and a sprinkling of parsley and oregano. (If you prefer, serve right from the hot skillet, letting guests help themselves to clams, toast, and herbs.)
