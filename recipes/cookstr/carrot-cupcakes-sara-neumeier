Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line 24 cupcake tins with baking papers. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside. Beat together the eggs and sugar. Add the oil and vanilla and beat to combine. Stir in the carrots. Add the flour mixture and stir to combine. Fill each baking paper two-thirds full. Bake until a skewer inserted into the middle of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
