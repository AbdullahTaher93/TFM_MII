Mix the curry powder, sugar, and salt in a wide, shallow dish and dredge the salmon in this, turning the pieces all over in the rub. Heat a pan with the oil and cook the fillets on high heat for about 2â€“3 minutes a side, searing the sides of the fillets too if they are very thick. Put the rice noodles into a bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave them to soak for 4 minutes and then drain them. Soak the dried shrimp in the wine, then heat the oil in a wok and fry the lettuce, baby corn, and scallions for a few minutes. Add the curry powder and minced ginger to the wok, and then the stock and soy. Pour in the shrimp with their wine and the drained, soaked noodles, tossing and shaking everything all together in the wok. Finally stir in the bean sprouts and give a final toss before turning out into a bowl and sprinkling the cilantro over.
