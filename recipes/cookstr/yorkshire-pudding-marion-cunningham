Turn the oven up to 450°F and pour the pan drippings into a 9 × 9-inch pan or an 11 × 7-inch pan. Put the pan in the oven to keep sizzling while you prepare the batter. Combine the eggs, milk, flour, and salt and beat until well blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake 25-30 minutes. Serve piping hot from the baking pan, a generous square with each helping of beef.
