Prepare a wok or stir-fry pan for steaming (see Notes). Season the fish inside and out with the salt and pepper. Place the fish on an 8- or 9-inch pie plate or shallow, heatproof dish. Place the dish in the steamer, cover, and steam over high heat until the fish turns opaque and just begins to flake, 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully remove the dish from the steamer. Stir the soy sauce and sesame all together in a small bowl. Pour over the steamed fish. Lay the cilantro sprigs over the top of the fish. In a small skillet, heat the vegetable oil over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Carefully pour the hot oil over the fish, stand back, and watch it sizzle. Serve immediately.
