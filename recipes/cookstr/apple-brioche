Butter both sides of the brioche slices. Grill the apple and brioche slices on the plancha for 2 to 3 minutes per side. At the same time, heat honey and lemon juice in a small pot over low heat. Put brioche slices back together, alternating each slice with a slice of apple. Place apple brioches on dessert plates and sprinkle with lemon honey. Serve hot.
