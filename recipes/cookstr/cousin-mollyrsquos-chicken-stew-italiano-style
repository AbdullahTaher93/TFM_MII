Season chicken well with salt and pepper. Heat one tablespoon of the extra virgin olive oil in a hot pan until just before smoking. Add chicken, skin side down, and sear until golden brown. Remove chicken, drain pan, and add one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Add onions until soft, about five minutes. Add carrots and garlic until they begin to soften, about five to seven minutes. Add tomatoes and celery and let cook for a few minutes. Remove the skin from the cooked chicken and add back into stew. Add chicken stock and simmer for about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, balsamic vinegar, and fresh chopped basil.
