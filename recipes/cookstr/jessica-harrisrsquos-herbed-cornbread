Preheat the oven to 425°F. Spray an 8-inch square baking pan, preferably glass or glazed ceramic, with oil. Combine the cornmeal, flour, and sugar in a large bowl, and sift in the baking powder and salt. Whisk together the thyme, milk, jalapeños, egg, and melted butter in a smaller bowl. Stir into the dry ingredients gently so that the mixture is thoroughly moistened, but don’t overbeat it. Stir in the corn kernels, distributing them evenly throughout the batter. Transfer the batter into the prepared pan, place it in the oven, and bake until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the middle, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.
