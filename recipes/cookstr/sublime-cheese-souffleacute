Preheat the oven to 375°F. Butter a 10-inch soufflé dish and put it in the refrigerator. Place a large pan with 1 inch of hot water on the center oven rack. This is called a bain-marie, or water bath, and will help the soufflé cook gently and evenly. Put the flour in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Pour the milk bit by bit into the flour, beating well with a whisk after each addition. Season with the nutmeg and salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. You may need to reduce the heat to keep the mixture from thickening too fast. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well with a wooden spoon after each addition. Remove from the heat and let cool until you can put your finger in comfortably. In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer at high speed, beat the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks when the beater is raised. Fold into the milk mixture, then fold in the cheese. Transfer to the soufflé dish. Place the dish in the water bath and bake in the exact center of the oven until it turns golden brown, about 40 minutes. Don’t open the oven door for at least 30 minutes while the soufflé is baking. 4. Bring the soufflé to the table immediately for your dinner partner to admire, then serve.
