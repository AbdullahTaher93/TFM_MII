Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Rinse the lentils until the water runs clear, and put into the stoneware. Add the water, onion, and carrot. Pour in the garbanzo beans and stir in the dry mustard, salt, and ginger. Add the soy sauce and honey. Stir again to combine. Float the bay leaf (or leaves) on top. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or on high for 3 to 5 hours. Taste. If desired, stir in the extra tablespoon of honey. Serve with white or brown rice if you’re a vegetarian, or a rib-eye steak if you’re not.
