In a bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter with the cinnamon until soft and smooth. Lightly spread the cream cheese on all of the bread slices. Hull the strawberries and thinly slice. Arrange the slices on 8 slices of the bread, covering the entire surface. Lightly sprinkle the berries with granulated sugar and top each sandwich with a remaining slice of bread. Trim off the crusts and cut the sandwiches into 4 triangles.
