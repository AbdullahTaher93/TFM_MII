To make the crust, place the almonds in a food processor and pulse until they are a fine powder. Add the honey and mix until smooth. With wet hands, remove the crust from the food processor and mold into the bottom of a 9-inch tart pan that is at least 1 Â¼ inches deep. Set aside. To make the filling, pulse the pine nuts in a food processor until they are a fine powder. Add the remaining filling ingredients and mix until smooth. You may need to stop the food processor several times to scrape down the sides. Pour the filling into the crust and spread it out evenly. With wet fingers, press the pine nut topping evenly into the top of the tart. Place the tart in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving (if you are pressed for time, place it in the freezer for 1 hour). Carefully remove the sides of the tart pan and cut the tart. Serve chilled.
