Preheat the oven to 450° F. In a medium skillet, melt the butter and sauté the onions and celery until wilted. Turn into a bowl and add the remaining stuffing ingredients. Stuff and truss the chickens and set them on a rack in a large roasting pan. Roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the thigh juices run clear, basting from time to time. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
