In a large saucepan, bring 2 quarts of salted water to a rapid boil over high heat. Toss in your potatoes and cook for about 15 minutes, or until the potatoes can be pierced with a fork but still offer considerable resistanceâ€”you want them to be firm but not crunchy. Drain, run under cold water, and drain again. Halve the potatoes and thread them onto skewers, with the cut sides all facing the same way. Rub them lightly with the olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and place them on the grill over a medium-hot fire. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or they are until golden brown. Slide the potatoes off the skewers into a medium bowl and add all the remaining ingredients. Season to taste and toss well. This dish can be served warm or cold; it will keep, covered and refrigerated, for 3 to 4 days.
