Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter an 11-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Pulse the wafers in a food processor until finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until well combined. Transfer the crumb mixture to the tart pan and press evenly into the bottom and up the sides. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is dry and set. Let cool on a wire rack. Pulse 1 half-pint of raspberries in a food processor just until broken up. Pour through a coarse strainer set over a bowl, pressing hard on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Melt the chocolate with the cream in a medium saucepan over low heat, whisking occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the raspberry puree and the salt. Scatter the second half-pint of berries over the bottom of the cooled crust. Pour the chocolate mixture into the crust and smooth the top with a rubber spatula, covering the berries. Refrigerate, tightly wrapped, for at least 6 hours, or overnight. Refrigerate the reserved raspberries for the garnish. To serve, remove the side of the pan, scatter the remaining half-pint of berries over the tart, and cut into thin wedges.
