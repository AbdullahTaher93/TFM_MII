Put the salmon in a glass dish. Mix the salt, sugar, sake, and wasabi paste in a little bowl and smear half of it over the salmon. Turn the salmon over and smear over the rest. Cover the dish with plastic wrap, making sure you press down on the salmon and in the corners before bringing it over and down the sides of the dish. Place cans of vegetables or unopened jars of pickles on the salmon to weight it and put everything in the fridge for at least 2 days and up to 5. When you want to eat it, remove the salmon from the dish and wipe it with paper towels. Put it on a board and cut down into strips, then cut each strip into 2 or 3 pieces to make sashimi-suitable shapes.
