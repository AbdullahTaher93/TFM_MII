With tongs, take one papad at a time and heat it over the stovetop. If you have a gas stove, cook it right over the flame, being careful to blowout little bits that catch fire. The best way to cook these is to constantly flip them until all parts are cooked and crisp. If using an electric stove, heat them on a wire rack set over the burner and flip continuously until they are crisped. Be carefulâ€”they bum easily. Lay the papads out on a large tray. With a pastry brush, lightly brush each papad with oil. In a small bowl, mix together the onion, tomatoes, and chiles. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the onion mixture over each papad. Top off each papad with a sprinkle of Chaat Masala and red chile powder. Serve immediately.
