Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and red pepper and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the lima beans, corn, cream, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook about 7 minutes, until the beans and corn are tender and the mixture has thickened slightly. Stir in the sage and parsley before serving. Score the skin of the fish with a sharp paring knife without cutting into the flesh. Season the flesh side with salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle lightly with the paprika. Heat the oil over high heat in a skillet. Sear the flesh side until well browned, about 3 to 4 minutes. Then flip and sear till the skin is crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve the fish over the succotash, skin-side up.
