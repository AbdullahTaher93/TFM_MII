In a large bowl, with a blending fork, blend together flour and hazelnuts. Add butter and blend until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add ice water, by spoonfuls, while tossing mixture with a fork. Add only enough water to make dough stick together. Press dough into a ball. Flatten into a disk and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm enough to roll out for your pie, about 20 minutes. Fill and bake according to recipe directions.
