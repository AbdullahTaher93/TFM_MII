Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chili powder and cook about 30 seconds longer. Transfer the mixture to a 4- to 6-quart slow cooker. Add the jalape√±o, tomatoes, beans, hominy, water, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper; cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours. Just before serving, stir in the cilantro and taste to adjust the seasonings.
