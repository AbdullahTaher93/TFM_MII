Cover the potatoes with boiling salted water, bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 minutes, until barely tender. Drain, peel and cut into Â¼-inch slices. While the potatoes are still warm, place them in a large bowl. Add the scallions, pimientos and anchovies along with the oil from the can. Combine the remaining ingredients and pour over the salad. Toss to mix and chill for at least 2 hours.
