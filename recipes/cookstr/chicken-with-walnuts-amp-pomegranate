Put the chicken thighs in a 4-quart slow cooker. In a large skillet, toast the walnuts over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Transfer the walnuts to a food processor and finely chop them. Add the walnuts and bay leaf to the cooker. Pour in 1 2/3 cups water and cook, covered, on the low setting for 3 to 4 hours, until the chicken is tender. Using tongs, remove the chicken thighs to a board and pull the meat off the bones in large chunks; set the meat aside. Turn the cooker to the high setting. Stir the sugar and pomegranate molasses into the sauce and cook, uncovered, for 1 hour, until the sauce is thickened and simmering. (If you prefer a much thicker sauce, pour it into a large saucepan and bring to a full boil over high heat; boil for 20 to 25 minutes, then add the chicken to the sauce and cook to heat through.) Return the chicken to the sauce and cook until heated through; retrieve and discard the bay leaf. Serve hot, sprinkled with the pomegranate seeds.
