To make the vinaigrette, macerate the shallots for 15 minutes in the vinegar, lemon juice, and a little salt. Whisk in the olive oil. Snap off the tough bottom ends of the asparagus spears. With a Japanese mandolin, very carefully shave each asparagus spear into long, paper-thin ribbons. Put the shaved asparagus in a salad bowl; season with salt and pepper, and dress lightly with the vinaigrette. Divide the salad among 4 plates. With a sharp vegetable peeler or paring knife, shave large curls of Parmesan over each serving. Variation: Alongside this one, serve another asparagus salad of cooked white asparagus dressed in mustard vinaigrette (with or without black truffle).
