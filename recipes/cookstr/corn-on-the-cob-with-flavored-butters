Prepare hot coals for grilling the corn. Peel back, but do not remove, the husks from the ears of corn. Remove the silk. Spread each ear with 1 tablespoon of the flavored butter. Rewrap each ear of corn in its husk and then wrap in aluminum foil. Grill the corn about 4 inches from the hot coals, turning frequently, for about 30 minutes.
