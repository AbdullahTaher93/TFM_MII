Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter or grease a loaf pan. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla to the sugar mixture and mix well. Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg and add to the egg and sugar mixture. Stir well to blend. Stir the applesauce and walnuts into the batter. Spread the batter into the greased loaf pan and bake for 50-55 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool on a rack.
