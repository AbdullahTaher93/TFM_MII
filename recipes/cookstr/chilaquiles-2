Heat about ¼-inch oil in a large heavy skillet. Cut the tortillas in half and then into ¾-inch-wide strips. Add strips to the hot oil and fry until almost crisp. Drain on paper towels. Combine the chiles, tomatoes, onion, garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper in a large saucepan; simmer about 5 minutes. Add the tortilla strips and simmer no more than 5 minutes. Spoon onto plates and sprinkle shredded cheese on top, if desired. Or top with a fried or poached egg for a hearty breakfast or brunch.
