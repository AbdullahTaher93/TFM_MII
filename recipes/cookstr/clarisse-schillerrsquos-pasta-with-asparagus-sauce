Trim off the tough ends of the asparagus. If the spears are not perfectly fresh and tender, beginning near the base of each spear, peel away the thicker skin to reveal the tender stalk underneath, stopping within a few inches of the tip. Cut on the diagonal into 2-inch pieces. Bring the water to a rapid boil in a large pot. Add the salt and the asparagus at once and boil for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a skillet large enough to accommodate the pasta later, warm the 6 tablespoons oil over medium heat and stir in the scallions and red pepper flakes. Using a wire skimmer or sieve, scoop out all the asparagus pieces and add them to the skillet with the scallions. Do not discard the water. Toss the ingredients together and saut√© until the asparagus pieces are sweet and tender, 1 to 2 minutes. They must not be crunchy. Remove the skillet from the heat. Return the water to a rapid boil and stir in the pasta. Cook until al dente. The timing will depend upon the type of pasta used. Drain the pasta and add it to the hot skillet with the asparagus and scallions. Toss well and check for salt. Pour in several tablespoons of olive oil, toss again, and transfer to a warmed large, shallow bowl. Serve immediately.
