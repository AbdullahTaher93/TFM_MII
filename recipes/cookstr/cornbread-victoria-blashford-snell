Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C ). Lightly oil the insides of an 8in (20cm) square baking pan. Whisk the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Pour in the milk, butter, and egg to the well and stir with a wooden spoon just until combined. Do not overmix. Spread the cornbread mixture evenly in the pan. Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the cornbread is browned around the edges and a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cut the cornbread into squares and serve warm.
