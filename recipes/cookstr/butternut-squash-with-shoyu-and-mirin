Cut the squash into 6 or 8 equal pieces. Scrape out and discard the seeds and stringy interior. Place the pieces skin side down in a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add enough water to just cover the bottom of the skillet. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer about 15 minutes, or until the squash begins to soften. Pierce the squash with a fork, then sprinkle with shoyu and mirin. Continue to cook another 10 minutes or until tender. If necessary, add more water to the skillet. Transfer the squash to a platter and serve.
