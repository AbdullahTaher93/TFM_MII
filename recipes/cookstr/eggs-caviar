Line a small cookie sheet with paper towels. Arrange the eggs, pointed side down, in the egg carton. Using an egg topper, neatly perforate the top of each egg and remove the top portion of each eggshell. Set the tops of the shells aside. Empty the egg yolks and whites into a large bowl and set aside. Gently submerge the top and bottom portions of the eggshells into a large bowl of very hot water until any remaining egg contents coagulate, about 5 minutes. Using your forefinger and thumb, gently remove the thin membrane lining from the eggshells. Arrange the eggshells, cut side down, on the prepared cookie sheet to dry. Set the bottom portion of the eggshells in egg holders. Whisk the reserved egg yolks and whites together, then strain to remove any pieces of eggshell. Melt the butter in a heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the egg liquids. Cook until the eggs just become creamy and thicken slightly (the eggs should not be lumpy), whisking constantly and briskly, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Whisk in the chives. Season the creamed eggs to taste with fleur de sel and pepper. Using a small spoon, neatly fill each eggshell with the warm creamed eggs, leaving room for the caviar. Spoon 1 teaspoon of caviar atop each. Set the top portion of the eggshells askew atop the filled eggs. Serve immediately.
