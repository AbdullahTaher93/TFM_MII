To prepare the farro: Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large saucepan and cook the onions for 2 to 3 minutes, until softened but not colored. Add the farro and stir until lightly toasted and evenly coated with butter and onions. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, heat the stock over medium-high heat until simmering. Adjust the heat to keep it at a low simmer. Reduce the heat under the farro to medium and in three additions (similar to cooking risotto), slowly stir the stock into the farro until it absorbs the liquid and is cooked through. This will take 35 to 40 minutes. Reserve any stock you don’t need. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm and set aside. To prepare the vegetables: Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat and sauté the garlic for about 30 seconds. Add the onions, fennel, beans, zucchini, squash, and corn and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the onions soften. Add the tomatoes, olives, and basil and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir the vegetables into the farro. Set the saucepan over medium heat and add the grated cheese, butter, and vinegar. Stir gently and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add more stock if needed to produce a creamy, risotto-like consistency. Divide the farro among 4 plates or small individual copper pots or other small bowls. Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with parsley and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.
