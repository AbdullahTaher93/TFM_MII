Toss the potatoes in a large bowl with the garlic, enough oil to coat, and salt and pepper. Place on an oiled grill and cook, covered, over medium-hot heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Turn several times with a spatula to ensure even cooking. Remove and keep warm. Brush the asparagus with the remaining oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill, uncovered, for 5 to 7 minutes, turning frequently, until lightly browned but still crisp. When done, cut on the diagonal into 3 or 4 pieces. Combine the remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Gently toss with the warm potatoes and the asparagus. Serve warm or at room temperature.
