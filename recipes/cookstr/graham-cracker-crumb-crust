Pulse the crackers in a food processor for about 30 seconds, until you have fine, even crumbs. Add the sugar and cinnamon if you wish, and then process for 1 minute more. You will have about 2 cups of crumbs. With the processor running, slowly add the melted butter through the feed tube. Continue processing until the crumbs are moist and come together, adding a little more butter if needed. The crumbs should be moist but not soaked with butter. Shape the crust as the recipe directs and freeze for 15 minutes before baking as directed in the recipe.
