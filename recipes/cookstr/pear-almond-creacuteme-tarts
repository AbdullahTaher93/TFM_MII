Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) Press dough into tart pans. Set aside. In a food processor fitted with metal blade, process almond paste and sugar until softened, about 30 seconds. Add butter and process until incorporated. With motor running, add eggs and vanilla through the feed tube until well incorporated, about 20 seconds. Add flour and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Divide mixture evenly between tart shells. Slice each pear half vertically into 6 to 8 slices, trying to keep the pear looking like it’s still intact. Place sliced pear over almond cream, pressing to fan pear. Do this five more times around the tart so you have 6 pear halves on each tart. Bake in preheated oven until crust is light brown and filling is set, 45 to 60 minutes. Variations: Try using 6 fresh peaches, peeled, pitted and cut in half, or 1 cup (250 mL) canned peaches or cherries, drained, in place of the pears for each tart.
