Slice the mushrooms into ¼-inch strips. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Sauté the celery roots and mushrooms for 5 minutes. Stir in the corn and tomatoes and cook until the corn is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm or, if you prefer, let come to room temperature. Brush both sides of the pork with Garlic Oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill over medium-hot coals for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Separate the leaves of each head of lettuce and arrange into a cup shape on one side of each plate. Fill the lettuce with the corn salad and sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. Place the pork slices next to the salad and serve.
