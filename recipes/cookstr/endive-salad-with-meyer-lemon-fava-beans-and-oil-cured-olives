The lemon cream: Place the shallot, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk in the olive oil. Gently stir in the cream, add a few grinds of pepper and taste for balance and seasoning. Place the lemon on its side on a cutting board. Holding it with one hand, cut off the pithy end and slice the lemon into paper-thin pinwheels. Pick out the seeds. Place the endive spears in a large bowl and pour the Meyer lemon cream over them. Add the fava beans, lemon slices, and sliced shallots. Season with salt and pepper and toss gently to coat the endive with the dressing. Taste for seasoning, and arrange on a large chilled platter. Scatter the olives and herbs over the salad.
