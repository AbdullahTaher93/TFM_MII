Combine the buttermilk and cream in a nonreactive bowl (such as ceramic or glass) and whisk gently to combine. Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave unattended at room temperature for 8 to 24 hours. This range depends on the dairy products you start with and the temperature of your room. Some bubbling may occur almost immediately, which is a sign that the bacteria in the buttermilk are at work. This acid in the mixture prevents spoiling while it is unrefrigerated on your counter. Crème fraîche will keep for about 10 days in the refrigerator.
