Rinse the skate, pat dry, and cut each wing in half. Season with salt and pepper to taste on both sides. Heat the oil and butter in a wide skillet over medium-high heat until the butter foams. When the foam subsides, add the fish membrane side up and sauté 3 minutes, or until the bottom is an appetizing golden brown. Turn the fish and sauté 1 minute longer, or until cooked through. Transfer the fish to serving plates and keep warm. Add the capers to the pan and stir them around for a minute. Pour the caper butter over the fish, garnish with lemon wedges, and serve immediately.
