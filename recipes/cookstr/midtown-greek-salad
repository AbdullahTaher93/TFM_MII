To Make the Faux Feta: In a small bowl crumble the tofu into Â½-inch pieces. Add the remaining ingredients and gently stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate until needed. This is best if made a few hours ahead of time or up to a day in advance. To Make the Dressing: In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients except the oil. Set aside for 30 minutes to soften the dried herbs, then whisk in the olive oil. Refrigerate until serving. Whisk again just before using. To Make the Salad: Combine all the salad ingredients in a large bowl. Add the faux feta and the reserved dressing. Toss to coat. Serve immediately.
