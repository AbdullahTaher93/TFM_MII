Preheat the oven to 425°F. Place the bacon into a large, heavy, ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all of the fat has nearly rendered and the bacon is just beginning to crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, another 10 minutes. Add the sage and potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are quite brown and sticky, almost like a jam, and the potatoes are just cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir the nutmeg and crème fraîche into the potato mixture and season with salt. At this point you can transfer the potato mixture to a gratin dish or individual ramekins or simply leave them in the skillet. Blanket the potato mixture with slices of the cheese and evenly pour over the cream. Place the skillet in the oven and bake until the cheese has melted and browned, about 15 minutes.
