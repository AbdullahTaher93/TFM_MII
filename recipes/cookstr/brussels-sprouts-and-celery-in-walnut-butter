Trim the bottoms of the brussels sprouts and remove any brown or yellowish outer leaves. Cut each one in half. Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a 4-quart saucepan. Place a vegetable steamer in the pot. Add the brussels sprouts and celery and steam them, covered, for about 5 minutes or until just tender. When the sprouts are just about cooked, heat the butter in a 9-inch skillet. When the butter turns light brown, add the steamed brussels sprouts and celery, the mustard mixed with water, and the walnuts. Season with ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Sauté until just heated through, and serve at once.
