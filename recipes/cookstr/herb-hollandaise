Set a medium-size, heavy saucepan into a larger pan filled with 2 inches of simmering water. Put the egg yolks, water, and a pinch of salt in the saucepan and whisk until warm to the touch. Add a few cubes of butter and whisk until almost completely incorporated. Whisking constantly, add the remaining butter a few pieces at a time, being sure that they are fully incorporated before adding more. Whisk in the lemon juice and season with to taste with salt and cayenne. Stir in the herbs. Transfer the sauce to a warmed small pitcher. Use right away or keep warm by setting the pitcher directly into the pan of barely simmering water. Thin with a tablespoon of simmering water if the sauce gets too thick.
