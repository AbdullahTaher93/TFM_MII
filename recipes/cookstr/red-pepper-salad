Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the red peppers and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, over low heat for 5 minutes, until the peppers soften. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer over high heat. Return the heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer for 12–15 minutes, until the tomatoes have broken down. Stir in the parsley, season well with salt and pepper, and cook for 2 minutes more, until the tomato juices thicken slightly. Using a slotted spoon, remove the peppers from the pan and arrange on a serving platter. Add the vinegar to the tomatoes, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the tomatoes have thickened. Pour the sauce over the peppers and let cool. Variation: Red Pepper Dressing: Process the salad in a food processor until smooth. Whisk in enough olive oil to make a dressing and use to coat a mix of green leaves.
