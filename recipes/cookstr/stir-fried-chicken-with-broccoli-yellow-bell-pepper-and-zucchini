Place the soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, chile sauce, cornstarch, and ¾ cup of water in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Set the soy sauce mixture aside. Place a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil. Add the zucchini and cook, stirring constantly, until it is tender and golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the zucchini to a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil to the wok. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Add the broccoli and ½ cup of water and cook, stirring constantly, until the broccoli is crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broccoli to the bowl with the zucchini. Add 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil to the wok. Add the bell pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until it is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bell pepper to the bowl with the zucchini. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon each of the sesame oil and peanut oil to the wok. Add the chicken and cook, stirring constantly, until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Add the soy sauce mixture and stir until the sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the reserved zucchini, broccoli, and bell pepper and the scallions to the chicken. Cook until the vegetables are just heated through, about 3 minutes. Serve the stir-fried mixture immediately with the rice and sprinkle the cashews on top.
