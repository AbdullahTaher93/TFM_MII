In a bowl, combine pineapple and salt. Set aside. In another bowl, combine cayenne pepper, turmeric, fenugreek and asafetida. In a medium saucepan, heat oil over high heat until a couple of mustard seeds thrown in start to sputter. Add remaining mustard seeds and cover immediately. Uncover in a few seconds when seeds stop popping. Reduce heat to medium. Add spice mix. Stir-fry for 10 seconds. Add pineapple. Cook, maintaining a gentle boil the entire time, stirring frequently, until mixture is thick, about 10 minutes. Cover and serve at room temperature or chill before serving.
