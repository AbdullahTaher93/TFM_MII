Soak the beans overnight in water to cover. Next day melt the butter in a stockpot, add the vegetables, bay leaves, and cloves, and sauté 3 minutes. Add the ham shank and beef or veal bones and cook 3 to 4 minutes, then add the peppercorns and flour and blend well. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more, then add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, skim, and simmer about 8 hours, covered (leave a small air space). Strain the soaked beans, add to the pot, and simmer 2½ hours more, stirring occasionally. Add more water if the mixture gets too thick or the beans are not completely covered. Remove from the heat, discard the bones, and put the soup through a food mill or coarse strainer-you must really purée the beans. Taste, correct the seasoning, add the Madeira, and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and serve immediately, garnished with the parsley, chopped eggs, and lemon slices.
