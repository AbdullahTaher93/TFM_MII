Roughly shred the beets, onion, carrot, and celery. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the beets, onion, carrot, and celery, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until just softened. Stir in the tomatoes with their juices and the garlic. Cook, stirring often, for 2–3 minutes. Stir in the stock and return to a boil. Tie the bay leaves and cloves in a small piece of rinsed cheesecloth. Add to the pot. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer for 1¼ hours. Discard the cheesecloth packet. Stir in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Top each serving with a dollop of sour cream. Variation: Lite Borscht: For a lighter soup, blend until smooth and add a little more stock. Serve hot or chilled, garnished with a swirl of natural yogurt and a sprinkle of chopped parsley.
