Start slowly heating at least 3 inches of cooking oil until it reaches 340°F. Meanwhile, put the cornmeal, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a mixing bowl, and whisk to blend. Add the grated and sliced onions, egg yolk, and 1½ cups of the buttermilk. Stir vigorously until the batter is well blended and the consistency of loose mashed potatoes. If it is too stiff, add more buttermilk.(The finer the grind of the cornmeal, the more liquid you will need.) Whip the egg whites in an immaculate bowl until they begin to mound (not stiff peaks). Quickly fold the beaten whites into the batter. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls into the heated oil. Puppies usually roll over on their bellies when they are done, but you may need to turn them to be sure they cook evenly. Fry until golden brown all over, then remove with a slotted spoon, and drain well on a rack or crumpled paper towels.
