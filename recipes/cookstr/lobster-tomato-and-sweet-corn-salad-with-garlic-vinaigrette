For the Vinaigrette: Sprinkle the salt over the garlic on a chopping board and finely mince the garlic. Combine this with the vinegar and the mustard in a small bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Continue whisking until the vinaigrette thickens. Season with pepper. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use. Makes Â¾ Cup. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add the corn kernels and cook until just tender, 1 minute. Drain into a colander and run under cold water to stop the cooking. Drain again and pat dry. Using a rubber spatula, gently combine the corn, lobster, and tomatoes in a bowl. Just before serving, season the salad with salt and pepper. Dress it lightly with the vinaigrette. Arrange the arugula in the center of a large platter and top with the lobster salad. Garnish the salad with the slivered basil, and nasturtium blossoms, if desired, before serving.
