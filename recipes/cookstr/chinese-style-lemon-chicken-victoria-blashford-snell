Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl, add 1¼ cups cold water and whisk until smooth. Set aside for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200°F (100°F). Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Add enough oil to come about halfway up the sides of a heavy deep frying pan. Heat over high heat to 350°F (180°C) on a deep-frying thermometer. In batches, dip the chicken into the batter. Carefully add to the oil and deep-fry, turning once, for 5-6 minutes, or until golden. Transfer to the baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Pour the lemon juice into a medium saucepan, sprinkle in the cornstarch, and whisk until smooth. Add the stock, honey, sugar, and ginger. Stir over low heat until the sauce comes to a boil and thickens. Simmer for 1 minute. Arrange the chicken on a serving platter and spoon the hot sauce on top. Serve hot with the bok choy and rice.
