In a fondue pot over medium-low heat, combine the olive oil, butter, garlic, anchovies, and red pepper flakes, if using. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat until the butter is melted, stirring to blend all ingredients. Reduce the heat to low; the mixture should stay warm but the butter should not brown. Arrange your choice of 5 to 6 vegetable dippers on a platter at the table or in individual salad bowls. Guests can dip a vegetable into the bagna cauda and use a slice of bread to catch the drips.
