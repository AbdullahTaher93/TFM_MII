To make the chutney mayonnaise: Place the mayonnaise and chutney in a small bowl and mix until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 1 week. To make the burgers: Place the chicken, cilantro, curry, coconut and lime zest in a large bowl and, using your hands, mix until the ingredients are evenly incorporated. Place the mixture on a work surface and divide into 4 balls of equal size. Form each into a patty about Â¾ to 1 inch thick, tossing it back and forth between your hands. Handle the patties as little as possible; do not work more than necessary. Prepare a grill to medium-high. When the coals are glowing red, after 15 to 20 minutes, cover with the grate. After 5 minutes, use a wire brush to thoroughly clean the grate. Brush the grate with oil. When the coals are covered with pale gray ash and you can leave your hand 5 inches above the fire for 2 to 3 seconds, the coals are ready. Sprinkle both sides of the burgers with the salt and pepper. Place the burgers on the grate and grill until well seared on both sides, about 5 minutes for medium rare or 6 minutes for medium. Transfer to buns or a serving platter and serve immediately topped with the chutney mayonnaise. Top with extra cilantro and coconut, if desired. Alternatively, place a cast iron skillet over high heat and when it is hot but not smoking, add the burgers to the dry pan. Cook until well seared on both sides, 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare or 10 to 12 minutes for medium.
