Preheat the oven to 475°F. First roast the red bell peppers. Place them on a baking sheet and rub the surface with a little olive oil. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes, until they are soft and the skin blisters. Put them in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave until cool enough to handle. Peel the peppers and remove the stalk and seeds but don’t wash away the sweet juices. Cut into strips. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Make the savory pastry following the recipe. Roll out the pastry on a very lightly rice-floured board. Line the pan with the pastry to a thickness of about Ysin. Line to the top with parchment paper and fill with baking beans. Chill the pastry for a further 15-20 minutes and then bake the tart base blind for 15 minutes or until pale golden. Remove the beans and paper, brush the tart shell with a little beaten egg and return to the oven for a further 2 minutes. This seals the pastry and helps to avoid a soggy bottom! Crumble the feta cheese using the tips of your fingers and spread half the cheese over the base of the pastry. Arrange a layer of roasted pepper strips and basil leaves on top. Season with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper and a sprinkle of sugar or balsamic vinegar (take care when seasoning as feta is quite salty). Cover with a layer of tomato fondue and spread the remaining feta cheese over. Return the tart to the oven for 10-15 minutes until it is hot and bubbly. Drizzle the tart generously with pesto and serve immediately.
