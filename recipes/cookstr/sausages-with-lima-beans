Position a broiler rack 6in (15cm) from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Prick the sausages with a fork. Arrange on the broiler rack and broil about 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onion, celery, and garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes, or until softened. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the wine. Bring to a boil, then stir in the canned tomatoes with their juices. Stir in the ketchup and paprika, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until lightly thickened. Stir in the lima beans and sausages. Simmer for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with basil and serve hot.
