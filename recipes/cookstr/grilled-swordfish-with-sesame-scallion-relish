Prepare coals for grilling or preheat the broiler. Make the relish: Combine all the ingredients (through the salt, to taste) in a food processor and process until minced. Do not over-puree. Rinse the swordfish steaks and pat dry with paper towels. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sugar, and oil. Rub the fish with salt and pepper and brush with the soy mixture. Grill or broil until just cooked through, about 4 minutes on each side. Serves with the relish.
