Hold stem end of asparagus in one hand and tip in the other. Bend the tip down until it snaps off. Discard the stem end. Cut each spear diagonally into 1-inch pieces. Transfer asparagus to a small casserole and add water. Cover and microwave on High power for 2 minutes or until asparagus is bright green and just tender. Drain. Trim chicken breasts and lightly pound between two sheets of plastic wrap to an even Â¼-inch thickness. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in flour to coat, shaking off excess. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. Cook chicken 2 minutes per side to brown lightly. Remove chicken to a plate. Add Madeira, chicken broth, lemon juice and capers to the skillet and bring to a simmer, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Return chicken to skillet and turn to coat with sauce. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 3 to 4 minutes or until chicken it cooked through, turning over once. Remove chicken to serving plates and boil sauce until slightly reduced and thickened. Add asparagus and heat through. Remove from heat and swirl in the lemon zest and 2 tablespoon butter. Spoon sauce over chicken to serve.
