Place a deep nonstick saucepan over high heat and add the milk. Stir in the cream and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, add the vinegar, and stir until the mixture curdles. The solids will separate from the whey. Remove from the heat. Place a double layer of cheesecloth over a strainer and pour in the paneer. Gather the edges of the muslin and dip the wrapped paneer in a bowl of cold water. Tie up the muslin and hang it over a bowl for 15 to 20 minutes or until most of the whey has drained; reserve the whey for another use. Place the wrapped paneer on a plate and put a heavy weight on it for 10 minutes or until firm. Unwrap and cut the paneer into slices or cubes.
