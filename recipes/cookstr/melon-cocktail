Prepare ahead The fruit can be prepared up to 4 hours in advance and refrigerated until ready to serve. Using a melon baller, scoop balls of each melon, or cut the fruit into 1in (2cm) cubes. Place the fruit in a large bowl. Add the chopped mint and honey and toss gently. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to allow the melon to absorb the honey and mint flavors. When ready to serve, spoon the melon and any juices into individual serving dishes. Garnish each serving with mint. Variation Exotic Fruit Cocktail Use one kind of melon and add any variation of cut fruit, such as star fruit, pineapple, kiwi, mango, blueberries, and strawberries.
