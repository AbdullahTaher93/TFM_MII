Whisk the yogurt, milk, sugar, and rose water together until evenly combined and foamy. (Or, process the ingredients in a blender until foamy.) Divide the crushed ice among 4 tall glasses, and pour in equal amounts of the lassi. Sprinkle each with a little ground cardamom and serve at once. Variations: Salted Lassi: Omit the rose water and sugar. Rub the rim of each glass with a wedge of lemon or lime and dip in coarse salt until coated. Pour in the drink and serve without straws. Fruit Lassi: Part or all of the milk can be replaced with a tropical fruit juice such as mango or pineapple. Instead of rose water, use a few drops of vanilla or almond essence.
