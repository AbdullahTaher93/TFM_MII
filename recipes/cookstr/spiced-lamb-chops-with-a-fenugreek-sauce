Thoroughly combine the Ginger Paste, Garlic Paste, coriander, both kinds of cumin, cardamom, cayenne, and ½ teaspoon of the salt in a small bowl, stirring to make a moist (and potent) rub. Coat the lamb chops with this rub and refrigerate, covered, for at least 30 minutes or as long as overnight. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the lamb chops, rub and all, to the hot oil and sear each side until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the chops to a serving platter. Pour the half-and-half into the skillet and bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits of rub. Add the fenugreek leaves, garam masala, and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, 2 to 4 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chops, and serve.
