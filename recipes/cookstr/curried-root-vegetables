• In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, potato, carrot, parsnip, and any additional vegetables. Stir in the curry powder and cumin. Stir in the coconut milk, cover, and let simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the potato can be easily pierced with a fork. • Thin the sauce with water, if desired. Season with the tamari, pepper, and any other seasonings to taste.
