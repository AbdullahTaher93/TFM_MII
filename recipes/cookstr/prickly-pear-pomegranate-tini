To make prick ly pear juice, peel the fruits, blend them in a highspeed blender, and strain out the solids. To make pomegranate juice, cut the pomegranates into quarters. Using a wooden spoon, smack the sections on the skin side over a bowl. The seeds should easily pop out. Put the seeds in a blender and pulse just to break up the seeds and release the juice. Strain the seeds through a fine sieve or cheesecloth. Combine all the ingredients in a pitcher or shaker except the pomegranate seeds, stir well, and pour into tall glasses filled with ice. Sprinkle the pomegranate seeds on the top of each cocktail.
