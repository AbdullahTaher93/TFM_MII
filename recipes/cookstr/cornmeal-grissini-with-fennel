In small bowl, stir together the warm water, yeast, and sugar and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir together the flour, cornmeal, sea salt, and fennel seed in a large bowl, then stir in the yeast mixture and ¼ cup oil just until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto an unfloured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly oil two large baking sheets. Punch the down dough and turn it out onto an unfloured work surface. Pat into a 14-by-10-inch rectangle. Cut crosswise into ½-inch-wide strips. Holding a strip with your fingers at each end, gently pull the strip to about 14 inches long. Place lengthwise on the oiled baking sheet, about ¾ inch apart. Brush the sticks lightly with oil and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. Bake in the upper and lower thirds of oven, switching the position of the sheets halfway through baking, until the sticks are crisp and the ends are golden, 18 to 20 minutes total. Transfer to racks to cool.
