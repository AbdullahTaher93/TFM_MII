For the parsnips: With a vegetable peeler or mandoline, cut the parsnips into thin strips. In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat until it bubbles, and sauté the parsnips 1 minute. Add the stock, season With salt and pepper, and cook until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Reserve, keeping warm. For the scallops: Season the scallops with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over high heat, heat the oil until smoking and sear the scallops until golden brown and medium rare, about 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan. For the wild mushroom vinaigrette: In a medium skillet over high heat, heat 2 tablespoon of the oil until smoking and sauté the mushrooms until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the thyme, parsley, and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, 20 to 30 minutes. Strain through a fine strainer, reserving the mushrooms for another use if desired. There should be about 1½ cups of liquid. Add a pinch of salt to the liquid and whisk in the remaining ½ cup of oil until emulsified. Whisk in the vinegar. Taste and season with salt and pepper. To serve: In a salad bowl, toss the mesclun with the sherry vinaigrette. Add the warm parsnip strips and toss. Arrange on 4 salad plates and surround with 3 scallops. Drizzle with the wild mushroom vinaigrette. Variations: Substitute shrimp for scallops. Substitute your favorite greens, torn into small pieces, for mesclun.
