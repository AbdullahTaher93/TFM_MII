Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and cook about 3 minutes, or until beginning to brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a plate. Add the onion and celery and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring often, about 6 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the garlic and hot pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until the sauce is thick. Meanwhile, cook the tagliatelle in a large pot of lightly salted water according the package instructions until al dente. Drain well. Return the pasta to the pot. Add the pancetta and tomato sauce and stir well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, with the cheese passed on the side.
