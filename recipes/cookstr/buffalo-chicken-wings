To make the dip: Fold the sour cream and mayonnaise together in a bowl. Add the blue cheese and fold gently. Fold in the remaining ingredients, and adjust the seasonings to taste. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use. The sauce will keep about a week. Cut the celery and carrots into sticks, and set aside for serving. Using a sharp knife, separate the chicken wings at the joint so you have a “drumstick” and a “thigh.” Set aside. Melt the butter with the Tabasco in a small saucepan. Transfer it to a large bowl and set aside. Heat the peanut and vegetable oils in a deep heavy pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is 375°F, cook the thighs and drumsticks, in small batches, until they are golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes. As they finish cooking, remove them with tongs and place them on paper towels to drain. Then place the wings in the bowl and toss them with the Tabasco mixture to coat. Season with coarse salt and pepper. Serve the wings immediately, with the celery and carrot sticks and Maytag Blue Dip alongside.
