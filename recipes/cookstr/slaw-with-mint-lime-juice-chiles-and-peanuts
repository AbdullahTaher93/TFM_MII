Whisk the ginger, lime juice, vinegar, sugar, chaat masala, toasted cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and ground pepper together in a large bowl. Add the scallions, jalape√±o, tomatoes, cilantro, and mint leaves and toss to combine. Add the cabbage and toss with your hands, making sure to coat it thoroughly with the other ingredients. The salad can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 4 hours at this point. Just before serving, sprinkle with the chopped peanuts.
