Cook olive oil and garlic over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the soy sauce, water chestnuts, and pepper. Cook 1 minute, tossing the water chestnuts. Add the lemon juice and blend. Then add the spinach and toss as you would a salad until the spinach is just wilted. Taste for salt and correct the seasoning, if necessary. Transfer to a salad bowl and garnish with the chopped egg. Serve warm.
