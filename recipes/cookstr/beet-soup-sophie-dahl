Wash and trim the stalky bits from the beets. Sweat the scallions in a pan with some olive oil on a low heat until they are translucent. Then add the stock to the scallions and leave on a low heat to warm. In another pan, cover the beets with water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes until the beets are tender. Drain, and when cool enough to handle peel off the skins and cut the beets into rough chunks. Put the beets in a blender with the scallion stock and puree until smooth. Add the shot of vodka, lemon juice and creme fraiche, season and give the mixture another whizz in the blender. You can serve this hot or cold. Either way, serve with the chopped dill on top, a swirl more of creme fraiche and some chopped hard-boiled egg if you feel like it.
