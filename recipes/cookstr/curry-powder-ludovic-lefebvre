Combine the first 10 spices in a heavy medium saute pan. Stir over low heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer the spices to a spice grinder. Add the turmeric and cayenne pepper to the same pan and stir over low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer the turmeric mixture to the whole spices in the spice grinder. Finely grind the toasted spices. Transfer the curry powder to a jar and seal tightly. Store airtight at room temperature for 2 weeks to allow the spices to blend.
