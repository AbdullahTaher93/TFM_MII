Heat the oil in a pressure cooker or heavy-bottomed pot and add the onions and ginger and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes. Add in the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, black pepper, and lamb. Mix well and add in the turmeric and salt. Cook stirring for a good 10 to 15 minutes, until the lamb is well browned. Stir in the tomatoes, potatoes, and 1½ cups water and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook under pressure for 15 minutes or on the stovetop, uncovered, on low heat for 45 minutes, until the lamb is tender and the gravy is thick. Cool slightly and remove the cover from pressure cooker if used. Add in the cilantro, mushrooms, and red chilies and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Serve.
