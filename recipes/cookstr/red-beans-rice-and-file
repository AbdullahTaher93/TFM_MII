Cover the beans with water and soak overnight. Drain the beans and discard the soaking water. In a 3½ 4-quart saucepan, combine the beans, onion, garlic powder, pepper, Filé, and salt. Add the water. If this does not completely cover the beans, add enough to do so. Cover and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook, stirring every 15 to 30 minutes, for 1½ hours. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook for another 30 minutes. The beans should be tender and beginning to fall apart. Serve over rice.
