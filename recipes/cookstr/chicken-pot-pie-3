Preheat the oven to 400° F. Toss the squash with the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter, season with salt and pepper and spread evenly on a rimmed baking sheet. Place in the oven to bake until tender and golden brown, about 30 minutes. While the squash is cooking, melt the remaining butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook the mushrooms and shallot, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes until lightly brown. Add the flour, and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly brown, about 2 minutes longer. Slowly whisk in broth and bring to a low boil, stirring constantly. Add the chicken, sage and cooked squash; season with salt and pepper and stir to mix. Reduce the heat and simmer about 5 minutes or until thick and creamy. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Meanwhile, flatten the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface, cut into a shape to fit the top of the container you are using (to slightly overlap). Fill the containers with the chicken filling and place the pastry over the dishes, allowing excess to drape about 1/2- inch over the sides. Repeat with the remaining cups. Brush the pastry with egg wash and place in the refrigerator to chill at least 1 hour. 7. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350°F. Place bowls on baking sheets and cut several slits into the tops of the pastry. 8. Place in the oven to bake 20 to 25 minutes until the pastry has puffed and is golden brown and the filling is warm through. Allow to cool about 5 minutes before serving, serve warm. 8.
