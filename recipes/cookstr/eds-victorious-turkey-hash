Toss the sliced almonds in a hot, dry skillet over a medium to high heat until toasted. Remove to a plate for a while. Add the butter and oil to the skillet, then throw in the chopped onions and peppers and cook, stirring, over a medium to low heat for about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, then add the shredded turkey and cook until piping hot. Return the reserved toasted sliced almonds to the pan, add the olives and mix in. Whisk together the sour cream, turkey broth and egg, then pour into the pan, give a quick stir to combine and shake in the Tabasco sauce. Finally, add the shaved Parmesan and stir until it begins to melt into the hash. On serving, sprinkle with chopped parsley, if wished.
