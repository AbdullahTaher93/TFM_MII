In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta for 10 to 12 minutes or until al dente. Drain and immediately submerge in cold water. Drain again. Put into a large bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Set aside at room temperature to cool. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300°F. Arrange the pancetta slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until crisp. Cut the slices into large dice and transfer to a small bowl. Cover the bowl and refrigerate if you don’t plan to use right away. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil until blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add as much of the dressing as needed to coat the farfalle. Toss with the mizuna and pancetta. To serve, center a small mound of the pasta salad on a small plate. Using a vegetable peeler, garnish the salad with shavings of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Garnish with lemon zest. Repeat to make 5 more servings.
