Put the spinach in a colander and wash it 2 or 3 times under running water. Drain well, and chop it finely. Set aside in a bowl. Wash the masoor dal in running water and drain. Place a nonstick saucepan over medium heat and add 2 cups (400 ml) water. When the water comes to a boil, add the masoor dal, turmeric, garlic, asafetida, ½ tablespoon of the vegetable oil, and ¼ teaspoon of the salt, and cook for 10 minutes or until the lentils are tender. Place another nonstick saucepan over medium heat and add the remaining 1½ tablespoons of vegetable oil. When small bubbles appear at the bottom of the pan, add the onion and sauté for 1½ minutes. Add the green chiles, tomato, and spinach, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tamarind pulp, the remaining 1½ teaspoons salt, and the cooked dal, and stir well. Add 1 1½ cups (300 ml) water, stir, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 8 to 10 minutes. In a small nonstick sauté pan, add the coconut oil. When small bubbles appear at the bottom of the pan, add the mustard seeds and cumin. When they sputter, add the fenugreek, dhuli urad dal, red chile, and curry leaves, and sauté for 30 seconds. Add this tempering to the masoor dal and stir well. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot.
