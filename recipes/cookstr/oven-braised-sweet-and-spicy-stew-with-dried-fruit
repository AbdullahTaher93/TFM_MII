Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the raisins, apples, apricots, water, wine, vinegar, shallots, cumin, and bay leaf. Over high heat, bring the ingredients to a low boil, then remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture stand, allowing the dried fruit to soften. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or flameproof casserole over medium heat. Add the seitan cubes and saute them until they are well browned and crispy on all sides (about 15 minutes). Reserving the juice, drain the softened dried fruit and add it to the seitan along with the carrots. Simmer the seitan and fruit together for 5 minutes. Add the reserved seasoned juice, and cover tightly. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Cook the stew in the oven until the carrots are tender (about 1 hour). Remove the stew from the oven and stir once before serving.
