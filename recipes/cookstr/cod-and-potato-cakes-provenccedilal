Place the diced potatoes in a saucepan of cold, salted water over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Drain the potatoes, spread them out in one layer on a baking sheet, and place in the oven until dry, 5 to 6 minutes. Meanwhile, place the wine, water, thyme, and raw garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, add the cod, and simmer until opaque, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the fish on a cloth towel and, using your fingers, flake it into a bowl. Mash the roasted garlic and combine with the olive oil and milk. In a mixing bowl, mash the dried potatoes with a fork, slowly adding the garlic mixture and mixing until it is incorporated. The potatoes should be slightly lumpy. Add the flaked cod and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Form the mixture into 8 cakes, dredge in flour, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. When ready to serve, heat the oil until shimmering in a medium skillet over medium heat and cook the cakes until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels. To serve: Divide the ratatouille among 4 (or 8) warm plates. Place 2 (or 1) cod and potato cakes on top and drizzle the basil oil around. Variations: For cod, substitute halibut, snapper, or bass. For Ratatouille, substitute Confit Bayaldi, Caponata, green and Yellow Squash Ribbons, or any green salad. For Basil Oil, substitute Chive Oil, Roasted Garlic-Black Olive.
