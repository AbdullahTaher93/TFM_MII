In a large saucepan, combine the ketchup, rice vinegar, apple juice, cider vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, mustard, garlic powder, white pepper, cayenne, and bacon bits. Bring to a full boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the apple, onion, and bell pepper. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes or until it reduces slightly. Stir it often. If you want a thicker sauce, reduce for a longer time. Let cool, then pour into clean glass bottles. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Brush it on food 5 to 15 minutes before the cooking time is finished. If desired, serve extra sauce on the side.
