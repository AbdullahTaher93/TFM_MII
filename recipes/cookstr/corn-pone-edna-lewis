Sift the meal, baking powder, and salt into a mixing bowl. Add the water and milk. Stir well, add melted fat, and let the mixture rest for 10 minutes. Then take the batter and shape it into pones by cupping both hands together and patting it into form. Place each pone upon a baking sheet an inch apart from the others and bake in a preheated 375° oven for 15 to 20 minutes—no longer or the bread will dry out.
