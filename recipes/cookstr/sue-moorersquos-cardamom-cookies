In a large bowl, combine the butter, sugars, egg, and vanilla and beat until light and fluffy. Sift the flour and baking soda into the mixture and mix well. Stir in the cardamom seeds. Shape the dough into two 10-inch logs the diameter of a quarter. Wrap the logs in waxed paper or parchment and chill for at least an hour. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the logs into very thin slices, about ¼ inch thick, and place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for about 10 minutes or until golden brown. Watch carefully, they can burn easily. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack after they’ve cooled for a few minutes.
