To make the meatballs, in a large bowl, combine the lamb, eggs, parsley, thyme, garlic, salt, paprika, and chile flakes and mix the ingredients with your hands just until they are thoroughly combined. Divide the mixture into halves, then quarters, and so on, until you have 16 pieces. Roll each piece between your palms to form the meatballs. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until it's almost smoking (you will begin to smell the oil at that point). Add the meatballs and cook them for 4 to 5 minutes, turning them occasionally, until they're browned all over. Push the meatballs to one side of the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. Put the garbanzo beans, vegetable broth, paprika paste, and red pepper paste in the empty side of the skillet and stir to combine. Simmer the garbanzo beans until the sauce is reduced by half, to the consistency of thin gravy. Turn off the heat and stir the meatballs and garbanzo beans together to coat the meatballs with the gravy. Mound the spinach onto four plates, dividing it evenly. Spoon the garbanzo beans and sauce over the spinach, reserving about Â¼ cup of the sauce, and place the meatballs, four to a plate, on top of the garbanzo beans. Spoon the reserved sauce over the meatballs. Put a tablespoon of yogurt on each serving of meatballs, sprinkle them with the reserved parsley and season them with sea salt.
