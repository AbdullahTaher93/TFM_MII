Heat butter in a heavy stew pan or Dutch oven. Add apples and saut√© over medium heat, turning pieces over often, 2 minutes or until they are coated with butter. Add lemon juice and grated lemon rind, if using. Cover tightly and cook over low heat, stirring often, 25 to 30 minutes or until apples are very tender. As the apples cook, check the pan from time to time; if it looks dry, add 1 or 2 tablespoons water. Stir in 3 tablespoons sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until mixture is thick and most of the liquid in the pan evaporates. Add more sugar if desired; heat briefly to dissolve it. Serve warm or cold.
