Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In a bowl, combine whole wheat and barley flours, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and creamy. Add egg, vanilla and honey, beating and scraping down the sides of the bowl until blended. Gradually add flour mixture, beating until smooth. Stir in oats, coconut, cranberries and pecans. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls (15 mL), about 2 inches (5 cm) apart, on a baking sheet greased or lined with parchment. Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes on sheets, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Variations If you don’t like nuts, eliminate the pecans and double the quantity of cranberries. Similarly, if you don’t like cranberries, leave them out and double the amount of pecans.
