Preheat the oven to 350°F. Trim the fennel, removing leaves and stems. Cut the bulbs into quarters. Heat the oil in a sauté pan large enough to hold the fennel in one layer and brown the cut sides of the fennel very thoroughly over medium-low heat until the fennel has begun to caramelize and soften. This will take at least 15 minutes. Put the fennel in a casserole large enough to hold it in one layer. Bring the stock to a boil, season it with a little salt and pepper, and pour it over the fennel. Cover the pan loosely with foil and braise the fennel until it is quite soft, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
