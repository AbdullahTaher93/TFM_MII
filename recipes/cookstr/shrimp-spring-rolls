In a bowl, mix together the shrimp, bean sprouts, red pepper, mushrooms, scallions, ginger, vinegar, and soy sauce. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp mixture and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Set aside to cool, then stir in the chicken. In a bowl, mix the cornstarch with 4 tbsp cold water. Dust a baking sheet with cornstarch. Lay a wrapper on a work surface. Top with half a cabbage leaf and 1 tbsp of the shrimp mixture. Brush the edges with the dissolved cornstarch and roll up around the filling, tucking in the sides and pressing together to seal. Place on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Line another baking sheet with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 200°F (100°C). Pour ¼ in (5mm) oil into a large frying pan. In batches, add the rolls and fry, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes, or until golden. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Keep warm in the oven while frying the remaining rolls. Serve hot, with the chile sauce for dipping.
