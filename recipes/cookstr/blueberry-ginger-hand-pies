Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine the blueberries, preserves, cornstarch, lemon zest, and ginger. Roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thick. Using a biscuit cutter, cut 4 1/2-inch round discs of pie dough. Lay the discs on the lined baking sheet. Use a pastry brush to brush water around the edge of a disc, and place a heaping tablespoon of filling in the center. Fold the dough over the filling to make a half-moon shape and carefully seal the pie’s edge with your fingers, then crimp it with a fork. Repeat with the remaining dough discs and filling. Chill the hand pies for 15 minutes to help the edges really stick together. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Let the pies cool for 20 minutes on the baking sheet. Stir together the confectioners’ sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice to make a glaze. Brush the pies with the lemon glaze and let them cool for an additional 20 minutes. Serve warm or room temperature. The hand pies are best served the day you make them, but they keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
