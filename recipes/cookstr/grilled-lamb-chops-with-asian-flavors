Combine all the ingredients except the lamb chops in a large bowl or other container. Add the lamb chops and turn to coat them well with the marinade. Refrigerate, covered, for 8 hours or overnight, turning the chops once or twice. Heat a barbecue grill to high, or preheat the broiler. Remove the chops from the marinade and carefully scrape the excess marinade off them. Grill the chops over (or under) high heat, 3 inches from the heat source, for 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Serve immediately.
