To prepare the blueberry sauce, combine the water, sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch in a large saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar and cornstarch. Add the blueberries and jelly and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture is slightly thickened and reduced, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. To prepare the pancakes, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl, and set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the cornmeal with 1Â½ cups water and a pinch of salt. Whisk until smooth while bringing to a boil over medium heat, then continue to stir for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Beat the eggs into the cornmeal until smooth. Add to the flour mixture and stir to combine. Gradually stir in the milk until the batter is very smooth. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat in a large skillet. When hot, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the batter for each pancake with a large spoon. Cook until lightly browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes, then turn and brown second side. Repeat, using more oil. Serve warm with blueberry sauce.
