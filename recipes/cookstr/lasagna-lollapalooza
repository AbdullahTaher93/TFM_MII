Now Now Grease a 9 × 13-inch baking dish and set aside. In a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, brown the sausage and ground beef, crumbling it into small bits as it cooks. Drain off and discard the fat. Add the basil, salt, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and garlic. Bring to a boil, uncovered. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 40 minutes, until the sauce is very thick. Remove from heat, and set aside. Cook the noodles until al dente according to the package directions. Drain the noodles, rinse in cold water, and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the cottage cheese, Parmesan, parsley (if using), eggs, salt, and pepper, and mix well. Set aside. Place half of the cooked noodles on the bottom of the prepared baking dish, overlapping slightly. Spread half of the cottage cheese mixture evenly over the noodles. Layer half the mozzarella and then half the meat sauce on top. Repeat the layers. Cover well and refrigerate up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
