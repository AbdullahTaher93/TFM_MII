Add water to the bottom compartment of a steamer and bring to a boil over high heat. Mix the soy sauce, rice wine, and shredded ginger together. Score the fish with cuts about 1in (2.5cm) and ¼ in (6mm) deep on both sides. Rub the fish inside and out with the sesame oil and salt. Scatter one-third of the scallions in a heatproof serving dish and add 2 fish and half of the soy sauce mixture. Place in one tier of the steamer. Repeat with another serving dish, one-third of the scallions, and the remaining fish and soy sauce mixture. Cover the steamer and cook for 10–12 minutes, until the fish is opaque when pierced with a knife. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Sprinkle the fish with remaining scallions, julienned ginger, garlic, chiles, and lime zest. Drizzle the hot oil over the fish and serve.
