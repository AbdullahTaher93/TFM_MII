Dry the duck legs on paper towels. Process the salt, garlic, peppercorns, coriander seeds, juniper berries, and thyme in a food processor until a rough paste forms. Transfer to a glass or ceramic baking dish. Add the duck legs, and rub with and bury in the salt mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 275°F (140°C). Rinse the duck well and pat dry. Transfer to a baking dish just large enough to hold the duck in a single layer, and add the duck fat. Cook the duck for 1½ hours, or until very tender when tested with the tip of a knife. Remove from the oven and let the duck cool completely in the fat. Transfer the confit and the fat to a zippered plastic bag and refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to serve, heat the duck with a thin layer of clinging fat in a skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, about 12 minutes, until browned and heated through. Serve immediately. Good with mesclun salad and roasted root vegetables.
