Have 4 shallow serving bowls ready. To make the polenta: In a saucepan, combine the chicken stock, water, and salt, and bring to a boil. Add the polenta in a steady stream, stir once or twice, cover, and turn heat to simmer. Let cook until all the liquid has been absorbed by the polenta, about 10 minutes. Add the cheese and rosemary and stir just until the cheese has mostly melted. Keep covered over very low heat. Meanwhile, poach the eggs. Place a small container, such as a metal measuring cup next to the stove. In a 2-quart saucepan, bring about 1 quart water to a boil. Break each egg into the measuring cup and gently pour the egg into the water. Repeat with remaining eggs. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes, depending how you like your egg yolks. For a runny yolk, cook just 4 minutes. For a hard-cooked egg, cook about 6 minutes. Working quickly, ladle the polenta into the bottom of each bowl. Using a slotted spoon, scoop up an egg and place it in the middle of the polenta. Drape a piece of prosciutto on the side of the egg, sprinkle with black pepper, and serve right away.
