Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Melt the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl suspended over a saucepan of simmering water or in a low oven. Cream the butter and sugar until pale, soft, and light, then beat in the lightly whisked eggs, the vanilla extract, and melted chocolate. Lastly, stir in the ground almonds, gluten-free baking powder, salt, and chopped nuts. Spread the mixture in the pan and bake in the oven for about 30-35 minutes. Leave to cool, then cut into 2in squares for serving.
