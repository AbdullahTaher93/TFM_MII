Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Rinse the berries and place in a buttered baking dish. Squeeze the lime evenly over the top. Sprinkle with sugar. Combine the flour, cereal, butter, pequin chile, and cinnamon. Stir in the apple juice. Spread the batter over the berries. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the topping is browned and crusty. Serve with frozen yogurt or ice cream.
