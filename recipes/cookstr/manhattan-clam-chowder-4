Bring the wine and water to a boil over high heat in a large deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add the clams, cover, and boil until the clams open, 4 to 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the clams to a bowl as soon as they open and set aside. (Discard any unopened clams.) Strain the cooking liquid through a damp coffee filter or several layers of damp cheesecloth to remove grit, and reserve. You should have about 3 cups: add water if you have less. Wipe out the skillet and cook the bacon over medium heat until crisp. Add the onions, celery, and bell pepper and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the oregano, basil, salt, and pepper and saut√© for 1 minute, stirring often. Transfer to a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Add the bay leaf, tomatoes, vegetable juice, potatoes, and the reserved clam cooking liquid, cover the cooker, and cook for 4 to 6 hours on high, or 8 to 10 hours on low. While the soup is cooking, remove the clams from their shells; chop coarsely if large. Mix with any juice that drips from the shells. Refrigerate until the soup is done cooking. When the soup is done, remove the bay leaf and stir in the parsley and the clams with their juice.
