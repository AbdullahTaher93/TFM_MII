Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan. Stir the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Then stir in the buttermilk, bacon, melted butter, and egg and mix gently. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, set on the center rack of the oven, and bake for 25 minutes. The corn bread is done when the edges are lightly browned and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cut into 3-inch squares to serve. Variation: Spoon the batter into 10 greased muffin cups and bake for about 20 minutes.
