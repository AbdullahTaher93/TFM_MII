Bring the milk to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk the yolks and sugar together in a bowl. Whisk in the flour and cornstarch. Gradually whisk in the hot milk. Return the mixture to the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until it comes to a full boil and is smooth. Let cool slightly, then stir in the vanilla. If not using immediately, cover with a piece of buttered wax paper pressed directly onto the surface of the pastry cream. .
