Cook the potatoes. Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2 -inch dice. Place in a 2-quart saucepan; add water to cover. Cover the pan and bring to boiling over high heat; cook for 4 minutes. Drain in a colander. Cook the salmon. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Rub the butter over the sides and bottom of a flameproof baking dish large enough to hold the salmon fillets in one layer. Sprinkle the shallots over the bottom of the dish. Arrange the salmon on top; add the potatoes and olives. Pour in the wine and broth; sprinkle the salt and pepper over all. Heat the dish over high heat until the liquid is not quite boiling and then place in the oven. Bake until salmon is cooked through--8 to 12 minutes. Finish the sauce. Transfer the salmon to a serving platter and keep warm. Place the baking dish with the sauce on the stove top again and bring to simmering over medium heat, stirring constantly; stir in the tomatoes and heat through. Stir in the scallions and basil and then immediately pour the sauce over the salmon and serve.
