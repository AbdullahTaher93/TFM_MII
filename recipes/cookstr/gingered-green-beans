Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pot over high heat, salt the water, and add the beans. Boil until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain the beans and let cool slightly. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the ginger, garlic, and chiles and saute for 1 minute. Add the beans and saute for 2 minutes, stirring. Use tongs to remove the chiles. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and serve.
