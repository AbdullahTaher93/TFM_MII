In a large bowl, combine the coconut milk, evaporated milk, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the sugar, shredded coconut, and almond extract. Mix thoroughly. Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water in a small bowl, and let it stand for 5 minutes. Then place the bowl in a small saucepan of simmering water. Stir the gelatin mixture often until the gelatin has dissolved, about 3 minutes. Stir about 1 cup of the coconut mixture into the gelatin. Then whisk the gelatin mixture into the remaining coconut mixture. Place the bowl of coconut mixture in a larger bowl filled with iced water. Let it stand, stirring often, until partially set, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the iced water. In a small grease-free bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at low speed, beat the egg whites until foamy. Increase the speed to high, and beat just until soft peaks form. Fold the whites into the coconut mixture. Lightly oil a 1-quart fluted mold. Pour in the coconut mousse, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula, and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. In a medium bowl, combine the chopped cherries, remaining Â¼ cup sugar, and rum. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. To unmold the mousse, wet a clean kitchen towel with hot water and wring it out. Invert the mold onto a serving platter, and wrap the hot moist towel around the mold; let it stand for 30 seconds, and remove the towel. Hold the mold and the platter together, and shake firmly once or twice to unmold the mousse onto the platter. Remove the mold. Cut the mousse into wedges, and transfer them to dessert plates. Spoon marinated cherries and their juice over each serving.
