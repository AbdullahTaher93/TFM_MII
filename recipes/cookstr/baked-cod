Pour the milk into a bowl. Add the fish and coat each piece well. Place the breadcrumbs in another bowl. Add the fish and roll in the crumbs until completely coated. Add the oil to the bottom of a casserole dish or baking pan, and add the fish. Bake in a preheated 325Â°F oven for 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, turn the fish over with a spatula, then return to the oven. Bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork. Serve with lemon wedges.
