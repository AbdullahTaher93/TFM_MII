Caution: soak preserved grape leaves in hot water then rinse several times to remove the brine; fresh grape leaves should be blanched for 5 minutes. Cook the onions in the oil until softened but not browned. Stir in the rice and allspice, and cook for 2 minutes more. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the rice is tender and has absorbed the liquid. Stir in the tomatoes, herbs, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon some of the rice in the center of each grape leaf, shiny side down. Fold in the sides and roll into a parcel. Pack the grape leaves tightly in a large saucepan; add the lemon juice and enough cold water to just cover. Place a heatproof plate on top so they don't unravel. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat; simmer for 30 minutes, adding water if necessary. Carefully drain then serve. Variation Vine Leaves with Lamb: Brown 9 oz (250g) lean ground lamb with the onions in step 1. Reduce the rice to ¾ cup and the stock to 1¾ cups.
