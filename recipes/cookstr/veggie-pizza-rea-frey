Preheat the oven to 400°F (2000(). With a paper towel or brush, rub inside the squash with a dab of olive oil. Place the beet and the acorn squash in a baking pan to roast. Roast both until they are tender (about 20 minutes). Once they are done, remove them from the oven. Let them sit while you prepare the other ingredients. Once the beet is cool, remove its skin and slice. Remove the rind from the acorn squash and slice. Cut 5 of the tomatoes in half. Place the basil on the bottom of a small baking pan. Lay the halved tomatoes on the basil, and top them with the fresh oregano. Cover with the aluminum foil and heat in the oven for about 15 minutes. Make a garlic chive pesto by toasting the almonds in a dry pan for 5 minutes. Place the almonds, garlic, garlic chives, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a food processor. Process these ingredients until they are well combined. In a sauté pan, combine the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, the leek, and two heaping spoonfuls of the pesto. Cook these over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the lemon juice and let cook for a few more minutes. Add the kale and place a lid on the pan. Cook for a few minutes or until the kale has wilted. Stir the mixture well and add the mesclun greens. Cook for an additional 2 minutes. Set aside. Once the tomatoes, basil, and oregano have come out of the oven, place them in a saucepan over high heat and let them cook down for about 10 minutes to make a sauce (they should start to thicken). Stir in the tomato paste and a spoonful of pesto. Let the sauce simmer until the pizza is ready to assemble. Slice the remaining 2 tomatoes. On the crust, layer the tomato sauce, the kale and pesto mixture, the acorn squash, the beet, the bell pepper, and the mushrooms. Sprinkle the Daiya Mozzarella Style Shreds on top. Bake the pizza for 12 minutes, or until the crust is tender. Serve.
