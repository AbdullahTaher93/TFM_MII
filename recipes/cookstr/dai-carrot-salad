Peel the carrots. Using a cleaver or chefâ€™s knife, slice them very thin (1/8 inch thick if possible) on a 45-degree angle. You should have 3 cups. In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Toss in the carrot slices and stir to separate them. Cook just until slightly softened and no longer raw, about 3 minutes. Drain. Transfer the carrots to a bowl and let cool slightly, then add the chiles and scallion ribbons and toss to mix. Whisk together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Pour over the salad while the carrots are still warm. Stir or toss gently to distribute the dressing, then turn the salad out onto a serving plate or into a wide shallow bowl. Serve the salad warm or at room temperature. Just before serving, sprinkle on the salt and toss gently, then sprinkle on the coriander and toss again.
