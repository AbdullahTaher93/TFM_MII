Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place bread on prepared baking sheet and toast in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Turn and continue to bake until very light brown and dried, 5 minutes more. Remove and let dry at room temperature for about 1 hour. In work bowl fitted with metal blade, process toasted bread pieces until fine crumbs. Freeze in a resealable plastic freezer bag for up to 3 months. Variation: Add 1 tsp (5 mL) Italian herb seasonings when processing for Italian breadcrumbs.
