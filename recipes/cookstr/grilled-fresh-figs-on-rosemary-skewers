Strip the leaves from the bottom of the rosemary stems, leaving about 1 inch of leaves at the tip. Finely chop 2 teaspoons of the stripped rosemary leaves and set them aside. Place the stems in a bowl and add cold water to cover; soak for at least 30 minutes. Drain the stems and blot them dry. Skewer 2 fig halves crosswise on each rosemary stem. Arrange the skewers, with the cut sides of the figs facing up, on a plate. Stir the honey and lemon juice together in a small bowl, and brush the honey mixture over the cut sides of the figs. Preheat the broiler or grill. Grill or broil the figs until they are lightly browned and softened, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Sprinkle evenly with the reserved rosemary leaves and some black pepper. Serve, on the skewers, while still warm.
