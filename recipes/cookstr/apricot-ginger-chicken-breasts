Trim chicken and pound to an even Â½-inch thickness between two sheets of plastic wrap. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook 2 minutes per side. Stir together the apricot preserves, soy sauce and ginger. Pour over the chicken and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, turning over once to coat with sauce. Drizzle with sesame oil. Serve sprinkled with green onions.
