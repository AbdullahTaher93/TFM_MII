In a large soup pot set over high heat, combine all the ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and remove any scum that has formed on top. Simmer for 30 minutes, cool for 10 minutes, then strain, discard the solids, and refrigerate the broth. The chicken fat can easily be removed from the surface when the broth is cold. In a medium saucepot over high heat, reduce the broth to about 1 cup. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and the cream, then whisk this into the reduced broth. Whisk until the sauce comes to a boil and thickens. Set aside in a warm water bath until ready to serve. Taste for salt and add up to Â½ teaspoon.
