Preheat the oven to 325°F. In a bowl, combine the mustard, garlic, thyme, pepper, and cinnamon. Coat the chicken pieces with the mustard mixture. Roll each piece in the bread crumbs and arrange in 1 or 2 shallow baking pans. Dot each piece of chicken with some of the butter and sprinkle with the paprika. Bake for 2½ hours.
