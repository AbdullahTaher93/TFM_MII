Coat a cast-iron skillet or another heavy skillet with nonstick cooking spray, then spray it a second time. (For this recipe, it is best to avoid a pan with a nonstick coating.). Heat the skillet over high heat. When it is very hot, add the chicken in one single layer, with the smooth side (formerly the skin side) down. If necessary, do this in batches. Allow the chicken to cook until it is a deep golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Turn and brown the other side. Transfer to the slow cooker, smooth side up. Return the skillet to the stove, lower the heat to medium, and add the sake, mirin, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Cook, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the pan. Pour the liquid over the chicken. Cover and cook on HIGH for 2 hours for breasts, 3 hours for thighs.
