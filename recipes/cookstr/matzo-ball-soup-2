Place chicken in a stock pot with salted water to cover. Heat to a boil; reduce to a simmer. Cook until chicken is tender, 45-60 minutes. Remove chicken from stock; reserve. Add vegetables, bay leaves and parsley to stock; simmer until vegetables are almost soft, 30 minutes. Cool slightly. Meanwhile, make matzo balls. Combine eggs, matzo meal, chicken fat and salt in a bowl. Work into a dough. Refrigerate dough and soup, covered, overnight. Remove dough from refrigerator; roll into walnut-size balls. Heat soup to a boil; reduce heat to a simmer. Drop matzo balls into soup; simmer, covered, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut chicken into bite-size pieces. Season soup to taste. Place 1 or 2 matzo balls, some of the chicken, vegetables and cooked noodles in a bowl; ladle hot soup over.
