To make the dip, combine the yogurt and blue cheese in a small bowl, mixing well with a fork until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. To make the seasoned flour, combine all the ingredients in a shallow bowl. Cut the chicken into 1½- to 2-inch-long pieces and dredge them in the seasoned flour, tapping off any excess. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot but not smoking. Drop the floured chicken pieces into the oil in batches (be careful not to crowd them, or they won’t fry up crisp) and cook until nicely browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Continue until all the chicken is cooked. 5. Sprinkle with salt and serve warm with the dip on the side.
