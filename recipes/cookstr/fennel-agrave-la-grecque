Put the fennel and onions in a large pot so that they are almost in a single layer. Season and sprinkle over the lemon juice and Pernod or Ricard. Add the wine, fennel seeds, garlic, herbs, and oil and put on a low heat to cook. Stir together briefly, once it has come to a simmer, and cook very gently, covered, for about 45 minutes. By this time the vegetables will be very soft and deeply flavored. Allow to cool to tepid or room temperature before tasting the juices to ascertain a correct seasoning. Spoon into a serving dish and sprinkle over the parsley, and fennel fronds if using.
