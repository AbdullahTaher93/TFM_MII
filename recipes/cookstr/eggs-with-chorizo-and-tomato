Heat the lard in a frying pan, add the onion, and fry gently without browning for 1 minute. Add the crumbled chorizo and cook over low heat until the fat has rendered out and the meat is just beginning to brown. Raise heat, add the tomato, and cook until the juice has been absorbed-about 4 minutes. Add salt to the eggs and stir them into the tomato mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring and turning them almost constantly, until the eggs are set-about 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning and serve immediately with corn tortillas.
