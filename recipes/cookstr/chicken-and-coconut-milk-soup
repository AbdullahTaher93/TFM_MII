In a medium saucepan, bring the coconut milk and broth to a boil. Add the chicken, lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, and galangal or ginger. Simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. Remove from the heat. Strain out the lemon grass, lime leaves, and gaiangal. Stir in the chiles and reheat to simmering. Before serving, stir in the nam pia and lime juice. Ladle the soup into individual bowls and sprinkle with scallions and cilantro.
