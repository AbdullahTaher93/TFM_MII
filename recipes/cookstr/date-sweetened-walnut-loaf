Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Lightly butter and dust with flour all sides of a 9 x 5 x 3-inch (23 x 13 x 6-cm) loaf pan. Chop dates with 2 tablespoons flour to make them easier to chop. In a medium mixing bowl, mix flour, salt, sugar, and ½ cup (75 g) walnuts. Mix in egg and butter with dates. Stir into flour mixture until batter is soft and sticky. Pour batter into loaf pan. Sprinkle remaining nuts on top. Bake, uncovered, 2 hours or until brown and a knife inserted comes out clean. Let cool in pan. Take cake out of pan and store in a tightly fitted container or wrap with plastic wrap. This loaf gets better the next day. Slice thinly and enjoy with a cup of tea.
