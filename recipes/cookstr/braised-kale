Place a large sauté pan over medium heat. Sprinkle the bottom with a pinch of salt and heat for 1 minute. Add the oil and heat for 30 seconds, being careful not to let it smoke. This will create a nonstick effect. Add the kale and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until wilted. Add the stock, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Earth Balance. Drain the excess liquid. Serve immediately.
