Preheat the oven to 400°. Spread the tomato halves, garlic, onion, pepper, and jalapeños on an oiled sheet pan. Sprinkle with salt. Roast in the oven until the veggies begin to blacken on the edges, about 20 to 25 minutes. Turn as needed. Purée in the blender with the chipotle and cilantro until smooth. This sauce can be prepared up to 3 days in advance, puréeing all ingredients except cilantro. Purée with cilantro just before using.
