Lightly sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper to taste; coat all over with flour. In large Dutch oven, heat half of the oil; brown shanks, in batches and adding more oil when needed. Remove to plate. Stir in any remaining flour, garlic, basil, paprika, thyme, cumin and coriander; cook over medium heat for 1 minute, stirring. Stir in wine; bring to boil, scraping up any brown bits from bottom of pan. Stir in 1½ cups (375 mL) of the stock and tomatoes. Return shanks and any juices. With scissors, cut stems from figs; quarter figs and add to stew. Bring to boil; cover and bake in 350°F (180°C) oven for about 2 hours or until lamb is very tender, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in deep skillet or shallow stovetop casserole, melt butter and sugar over medium heat; stir in onions, carrots, parsnips and turnips until coated. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Add remaining stock and bring to boil. Bake, uncovered and stirring occasionally, in 350°F (180°C) oven for about 45 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir into cooked shanks. (Stew can be cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days; reheat slowly on stovetop, stirring often, or in 350°F/180°C oven, covered, for 30 minutes or until bubbly.)
