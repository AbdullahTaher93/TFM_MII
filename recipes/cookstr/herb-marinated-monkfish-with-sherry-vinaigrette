Place the monkfish fillets in a large mixing bowl and combine with the olive oil and the herbs youâ€™ve chosen. Rub the fish well so that the herbs stick to the fish. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours but no longer than 4 hours. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the maple syrup and vinegar together. Slowly add the corn oil and olive oil to the mixture to create an emulsion. Whisk in the shallots, then taste and add salt and pepper if necessary. Refrigerate until needed. This can be made one day ahead, and if you remember to you should make it ahead because the flavor will improve. Bring to room temperature before serving. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper and place on the cooking grate. Close the lid and cook for about 3 minutes, then turn and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. The fish should be just opaque in the center and relatively firm to the touch. Transfer to a platter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes. To serve, slice the fillets diagonally and arrange on individual plates. Spoon the vinaigrette on top of and around the fish.
