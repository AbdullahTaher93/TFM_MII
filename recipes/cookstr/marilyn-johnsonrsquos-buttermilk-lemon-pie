Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the sugar, flour, and eggs. Blend in the butter and the buttermilk with a whisk. Add the lemon juice, vanilla, nutmeg, and lemon zest and mix well. Pour the filling into the crust. Set the pie on a baking sheet and bake it for 60 to 75 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center comes out moist but clean. Remove the pie and let it cool on a rack before cutting.
