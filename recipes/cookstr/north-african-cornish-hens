Using a sharp knife or a cleaver, split each hen down its back and open it up flat, like a book. Arrange the hens, skin side up, on two large roasting pans. Squeeze the lemons and oranges over the hens, and then place the squeezed lemon and orange pieces underneath the hens. On a work surface, sprinkle the garlic with the salt. Using a large knife, chop and smear them together to form a paste. Scrape the garlic paste into a small bowl, and stir in the paprika, cumin, ginger, and optional cayenne. Gradually stir in the oil to make a paste. Spread the paste on the hens’ skin, and let them stand at room temperature, covered, for 1 hour before roasting. Position a rack in the top third of the oven, and preheat to 400°. Roast the hens, basting often with the drippings, until the juices run yellow when the flesh is pierced with a fork, 50 to 60 minutes. Serve immediately, discarding the cooked fruits.
