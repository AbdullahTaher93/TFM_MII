Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter two 9-x-5-inch bread pans and set aside. Place the pumpkin, oil, honey, and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl and stir with a wooden spoon. Add all the remaining ingredients and stir until well blended. Divide the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then turn the loaves out of the pans. Finish cooling the bread on the rack before serving.
