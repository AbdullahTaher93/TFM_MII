Place the beans in a medium saucepan, with cold water to cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until tender, about 45 minutes. Drain well. In a mixing bowl, combine the beans with ¼ cup of the vinaigrette and the thyme, tomatoes, and onion. Cool to room temperature. Season to taste with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, toss the mesclun with ¼ cup of the vinaigrette. Place about ½ cup of the white bean salad on each of 6 plates. Arrange the greens and lobster meat in 3 small alternating mounds around them. Drizzle the remaining vinaigrette. Variations: Substitute 18 cooked jumbo shrimp, shelled and left whole, for the lobster. For Sherry Vinaigrette, substitute Lobster Vinaigrette.
