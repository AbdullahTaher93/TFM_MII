Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Lightly butter a 13 × 9-inch glass baking dish. To make the filling, in the prepared dish, toss together the pears, cranberries, granulated sugar, flour, and butter. To make the topping, in a medium bowl, using your fingertips, work the flour, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon until combined and crumbly. Work in the walnuts. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the filling. Place on a baking sheet. Bake until the juices are bubbling and the pears are tender, about 45 minutes. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature. (The crisp can be baked up to 8 hours ahead, cooled, covered, and stored at room temperature.)
