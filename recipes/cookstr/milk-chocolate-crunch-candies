Temper the milk chocolate: Follow the instructions on this page to temper the chocolate (and see the Note on tempered chocolate). Once it is ready, add the rice krispies and fold the cereal into the chocolate until all of it is coated. Shape the candies: Using two small teaspoons, scoop and scrape the candies into small mounds on the lined cookie sheets. Try to make the mounds higher and not wider by adding small amounts of chocolate crispies to the top of the candy. Place the candies in a cool, dry place to set. Do not refrigerate. If the chocolate is well tempered and it is not too hot in the room you are working in, the chocolate should become shiny and dry within 5 to 10 minutes.
