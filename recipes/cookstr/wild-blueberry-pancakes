Separate the eggs, placing the yolks in one medium bowl and the whites in another bowl. Whisk the egg yolks with the milk and melted butter. Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the egg/milk mixture. Whisk together gently just until blended. Donâ€™t worry if a few lumps remain; they will work themselves out. Fold in the egg whites and gently stir in the blueberries. Preheat a lightly greased griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat. Ladle out the batter to form 3-inch pancakes. Cook until bubbles appear on the top, 1 to 2 minutes, then flip and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 1 minute. Serve with butter and warm maple syrup.
