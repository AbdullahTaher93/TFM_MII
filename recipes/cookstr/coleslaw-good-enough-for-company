Spread the nuts in a single layer on a microwave-safe dish. Microwave, uncovered, on high power until fragrant and lightly toasted, about 2 minutes, stirring once halfway through. (If you are using roasted peanuts, this step wonâ€™t be necessary.) Set the nuts aside to cool. Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, milk, and curry powder in a 3-quart or larger bowl and whisk to blend. Halve the cabbage and remove and discard the tough core. Cut it into very thin, long shreds, then cut the shreds in half and place them in the bowl. Add the raisins and nuts. (If you are making the slaw more than 1 hour ahead, wait to stir the raisins and nuts into the mixture until just before serving.) Stir until the mixture is evenly coated with the dressing. Season with the salt and black pepper. Serve at once or refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve, up to 24 hours.
