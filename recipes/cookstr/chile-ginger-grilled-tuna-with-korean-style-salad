In a medium bowl, combine the cabbage, bean sprouts, and cucumber. Make the dressing: In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and whisk together well. Add just enough dressing to the cabbage-cucumber mixture to moisten the ingredients, toss well, and refrigerate. Make the rub: In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix well. Rub the tuna steaks generously with the spice rub, place them on the grill over a hot fire, and cook for about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. To check for doneness: Cut into one of the steaks and check to see that it is just translucent in the center. Remove from the grill and serve with the chilled vegetable salad.
