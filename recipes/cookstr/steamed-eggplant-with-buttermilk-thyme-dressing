Cut the eggplants lengthwise—from stem end to bottom—into very thin slices. Do not peel. Bring 1 quart water to a simmer in the bottom of a steamer. Place the eggplant slices—slightly overlapping—on the steaming rack. Place the rack over the simmering water, cover, and steam until the eggplant is soft and cooked through, about 15 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the slices to a large platter. Sprinkle with the garlic, season with salt, and drizzle with the dressing. Toss gently to coat the eggplant. Serve immediately. This dish should be eaten warm.
