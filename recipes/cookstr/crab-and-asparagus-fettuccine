1 Heat the olive oil in a heavy frying pan, add the shallot, and cook gently until soft but not brown. Add the thyme, anchovy paste, wine, and fish stock, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. 2 Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the asparagus and cook for 4-6 minutes until just tender. Drain, reserving the cooking water, and add the asparagus to the shallot liquid along with the crab. 3 Cook the fettuccine in the asparagus water for 3-4 minutes. Drain and add to the crab sauce. 4 Heat the butter in a frying pan until nutty and golden. Add the lemon juice and parsley and pour it over the pasta. Toss to combine. Season to taste with plenty of black pepper.
