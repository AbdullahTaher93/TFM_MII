Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed saucepan and add the onions, garlic, red peppers, and jalape√±os. Cook until they are wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the chile powder, cumin, and oregano and stir. Add the chicken and cook until browned, about 5 more minutes. Add the beans, tomatoes, and beer. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 30 minutes, until the chicken is entirely cooked. Add the chocolate and the cashews and stir. Cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, for another 10 minutes, until the chocolate is entirely melted and mixed in and the liquid is well blended. Season with the salt and serve warm.
