Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) Prepare the base: In a saucepan, over low heat, melt chocolate and butter, stirring until smooth. Add coffee powder and mix well. Set aside to cool slightly. In a large bowl, beat eggs and brown sugar. Add cooled chocolate mixture and mix well. Blend in flour and baking powder. Spread evenly in prepared pan. Chill for 10 minutes. Prepare the cheesecake layer: In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until incorporated. Stir in coffee until blended. Blend in flour. Spread evenly over base. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until set. Prepare the topping: In a small bowl, mix together sour cream and sugar. Spread over warm cheesecake. Bake for 10 minutes. Place pan on a wire rack to cool completely. When cool, cut cake into 6 long strips, then cut strips across on diagonal into diamond shapes. If desired, top each with a chocolate-covered almond or espresso bean.
