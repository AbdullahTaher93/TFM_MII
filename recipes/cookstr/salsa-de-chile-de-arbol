Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add the chiles, tomatoes, and garlic, and dryroast, shaking the pan occasionally, until the skins start to blacken and the vegetables are soft. This can also be done under a broiler. Cool the vegetables. Remove the skins from the garlic. Put all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and pulse to coarsely blend, adding just enough water to form a sauce. Season to taste with salt. This sauce may be stored in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.
