Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the leeks and cover. Cook, gently shaking the pot from time to time, for about 15 minutes, or until the leeks are softened and golden. Add the stock, potato, and celery and bring to a boil, stirring often. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly. In batches, pur√®e in a blender with the lid ajar. Season with salt and pepper and cool completely. Stir in the cream. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours, or until well chilled. Ladle into soup bowls, sprinkle with chives and black pepper, and add a drizzle of cream. Serve chilled.
