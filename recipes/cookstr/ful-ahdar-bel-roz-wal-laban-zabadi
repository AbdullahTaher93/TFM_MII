Pour the rice into boiling salted water. Boil hard for about 14 minutes, until it is almost but not entirely tender. Drain and put back into the pan. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the oil, the herbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Put the lid on and leave the pan on very low heat for the rice to steam for about 15 minutes, or until tender. Boil the fava beans in salted water for a few minutes, until tender, then drain. Stir gently into the rice with the remaining oil. Serve hot or cold with the yogurt, beaten with crushed garlic if you like and a little salt, poured over.
