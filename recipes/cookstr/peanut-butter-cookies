Cream the butter and peanut butter, cream in the brown sugar, then beat in the egg. Sift the flour and salt and stir in. If desired, stir in the vanilla. This will make a very stiff dough. Form into long rolls about 1 inch in diameter. Cut into lengths of 1 inch or less, form into balls, and place an inch apart on greased cookie sheets. Press down the top of each cookie with a fork, fIrst in one direction and then the other to make a crisscross design. Bake in a preheated 375-degree oven 9 to 12 minutes or until a delicate brown. Remove from pans while still slightly warm, and cool on a rack. Store in airtight containers. Rich Peanut Butter Cookies: Rich Peanut Butter Cookies:
