Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets with butter. In a large bowl, combine the flour, oats, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Add the prune puree, orange juice, melted butter, egg whites, and vanilla. Mix with a wooden spoon until blended. Stir in the raisins and apricots. For each cookie, scoop 2 generous tablespoons of dough from the bowl and drop onto the baking sheets. Bake for 10 to 11 minutes, until just set and lightly browned around the edges. Do not overbake. Transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
