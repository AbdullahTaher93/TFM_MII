Preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C). Place the slices of bread on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, turning the slices over at a midway point in the baking. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Let the bread slices cool. Break the slices into smaller pieces and process in a food processor. Use immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
