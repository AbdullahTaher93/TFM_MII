Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) Halve potatoes lengthwise, then cut into thick wedges of uniform thickness. Transfer to a bowl. Add oil, paprika, garlic salt, oregano, cayenne and freshly ground pepper to taste and toss until potatoes are well coated. Transfer potatoes to baking sheets, lining them up nicely (do not let them touch). Bake in preheated oven, turning once or twice, for about 30 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. Top potatoes with half the cheese, then beans, tomatoes, green onions, olives and remaining cheese. Return to oven and bake for about 5 minutes or until cheese has melted (broil if necessary). Serve immediately (see Notes).
