Butterfly the meat and score it inside with a sharp thin knife. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, the minced garlic, and parsley. Arrange the peppers, egg, and ham over one cut side of the meat. Close the meat and tie securely lengthwise and crosswise with kitchen twine. In a deep pot, heat the oil. Dust the meat with flour and brown on all sides. Add the onion and saute until translucent, then add the tomato, unpeeled garlic, and peppercorns. Saute for 2 minutes more. Stir in the wine and salt to taste, cover, and simmer for 50 minutes to 1 hour (about 35 minutes per pound), until the meat’s internal temperature reaches 160°F. Remove the meat to a warm platter and cook down the sauce briefly. Press the garlic cloves with the back of a wooden spoon to extract the garlic flesh and discard the skin. To serve, remove the string, slice the meat about ¾ inch thick, and spoon on the sauce.
