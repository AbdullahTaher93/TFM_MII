In a large frying pan or heavy pot, heat the olive oil over high heat and brown the beef in batches (each batch should take 5 to 7 minutes); set aside. Turn down the heat to medium, add the onions, and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until soft and golden, scraping the bits off the bottom of the pan as they loosen. Add the flour, stirring and cooking for a few more minutes. Add the wine, finish scraping all the bits and cooked meat juices off the bottom of the pan, and bring to a gentle boil. Add the browned beef, carrots, garlic, herbs, Kitchen Bouquet or Maggi sauce, and enough water to cover. Return to a boil over medium-high heat, and then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 hours, or until fork-tender. Or cover the pot and place in a 325Â°F oven for 2 hours, until fork-tender. Check and stir often, and add water a little at a time, if needed. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Allow to cool completely. Assemble the tamales, using 1/4 cup masa and 1/4 cup filling for each tamale. Transfer to a steamer and steam for 55 minutes.
