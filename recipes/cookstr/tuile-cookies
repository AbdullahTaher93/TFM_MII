Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Beat the butter and confectioner's sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg. Gently fold in the flour. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment or a silicone baking liner. Place about 1½ tsp of the batter on the lined baking sheet and spread it out thinly to about a 3in (7.5cm) diameter. Make another 1 or 2 rounds on the same baking sheet. Bake for 5–8 minutes, or until they are just beginning to turn pale gold. Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Working quickly, one at a time, slide a metal icing spatula under a cookie and drape over a rolling pin so that they cool in a curved shape. Repeat with the remaining batter.
