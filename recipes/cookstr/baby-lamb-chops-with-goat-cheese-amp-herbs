Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Finely chop the rosemary and the thyme and combine. Set aside. In a bowl, mix the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Arrange lamb chops on a foil-lined baking dish with deep sides. Season the lamb with pepper (no salt is necessary because of the soy sauce), then pour the soy sauce mixture over the meat. Slice the goat cheese log into 12 rounds and place one round into each lamb chop. Sprinkle the herb mixture over the cheese. Roast the chops for approximately 15 minutes, then broil them for a minute or two until the cheese takes on a golden color. Serve warm or at room temperature.
