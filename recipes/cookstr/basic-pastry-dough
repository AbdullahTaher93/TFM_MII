Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or two knives. Mix lightly only until the mixture resembles coarse meal and some of the shortening remains the size of very tiny peas; the texture will not be uniform but will contain crumbs and small bits and pieces. Sprinkle the water over the flour mixture 1 tablespoon at a time and mix lightly with a fork, using only enough water so the dough will hold together. Press the dough together into a ball. If there are dry places that donâ€™t adhere, sprinkle a little more water over them.
