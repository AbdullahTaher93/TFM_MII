Melt the butter in a heavy 5-quart pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and saute until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the wine; bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the mussels. Cover and cook just until the mussels open, about 2 minutes. Stir the mussels in the cooking liquid and cook for 2 minutes longer. Discard any mussels that do not open. Using tongs, transfer the mussels to a large bowl; cover loosely to keep them warm. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer and into a large glass measuring cup; discard the shallots. Return the cooking liquid to the pot. Add the cream and the Curry Powder. Cover and steep for 5 minutes over low heat. Divide the mussels and cooking liquid among 4 wide shallow bowls. Garnish with the chervil and peppermint. Serve immediately.
