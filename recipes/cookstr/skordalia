For Potato Skordalia: Place the potato in a small saucepan and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until soft all the way through, about 10 minutes. Drain. Transfer the potato to a food processor. Add the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth. Use right away, or cover and store in the refrigerator for as long as overnight. For Bread Skordalia: Place the bread cubes in a large bowl, add the water, and soak until saturated, about 2 minutes. Drain the bread, and squeeze all the liquid from it. Place the bread in a food processor, add the remaining ingredients, and blend until smooth. Use right away, or cover and store in the refrigerator for as long as overnight. Other Mothers’ Versions: Instead of almonds, use pine nuts. Soak the bread in olive oil instead of water. Instead of potato or bread, use half of each—another traditional formula. Instead of potato or bread, use chickpeas, lima beans, broad (fava) beans, or another mealy legume that approximates the texture of potato when cooked. Add a pinch of cayenne pepper. Add 8 to 10 pitted black olives, 1 tablespoon capers, or 1 to 2 tablespoons Olive and Caper Tapenade.
