Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the salsa and sour cream and mix well. Turn the mixture into a lightly sprayed or oiled 9-by-5-inch loaf pan and gently pat down. Bake until the loaf is firm and the top is lightly browned, about 1 hour. Let stand in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Remove the loaf from the pan and slice to serve. Serve with the salsa and sour cream.
