1. Heat the oil in a large casserole over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until soft and transparent. Stir in the zucchini, eggplant, red pepper, and garlic, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften. Add the stock, tomatoes with their juices, and the chopped oregano and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and partially cover the pan. Simmer about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender. Add salt and black pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately, garnished with oregano sprigs.
