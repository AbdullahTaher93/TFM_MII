Place the whole-wheat flour and 4 cups of the all-purpose flour with the salt in a large bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer, and make a well in the middle. Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in ¾ cup of the water and pour into the well. Gradually, using a spoon or the dough hook of the mixer, work in 3 of the eggs, the oil, ½ cup of the honey, and the remaining cup of water. Either knead in the mixer or turn out onto a floured board and knead, adding all-purpose flour as needed until a soft, elastic dough is formed. Cover the dough with a towel and let rise for 2 hours. Punch down, divide into 6 pieces, and roll them out to 2-by-18-inch ropes. Place 3 pieces together, pinch ends, and braid. Repeat to make a second loaf. Beat the remaining egg with the remaining teaspoon of honey and brush on the challah. Place on a greased cookie sheet. Preheat the oven to 375°F and bake challahs for about 45 minutes or until the loaves are golden and sound hollow when tapped.
