Preheat the oven to 350° F, and position a rack in the middle of the oven. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Turn off the heat, add the chocolate, and stir occasionally until melted and combined. Set aside and cool slightly. Stir the sugar and salt into the warm chocolate mixture, using a wooden spoon. Add the vanilla and eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the flour until just incorporated. Fold in the nuts, if using. Pour the mixture into an 8 × 8-inch nonstick baking pan, and smooth the surface using your hands. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, until the center is firm. Cool completely. When ready to serve, remove the brownies from the pan and cut into 1½- to 2-inch squares, or larger if you like.
