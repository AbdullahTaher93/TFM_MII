Place the salt cod in a large bowl and add enough cold water to cover. Refrigerate for 24 hours, changing the water from time to time. Drain the salt cod. Place in a shallow frying pan and cover with fresh cold water. Bring to a simmer. Cook over low heat for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand 10 minutes more. Drain well. Remove the skin and bones from the fish. Flake the flesh into a food processor. Add the garlic and process until smooth. Transfer to a saucepan. Heat the brandade over low heat, whisking in enough of the oil and milk, a tablespoon at a time, to make a creamy mixture that holds its shape. Transfer the hot brandade to a serving bowl. Garnish with the parsley, a drizzle of olive oil, and a grinding of pepper. Serve hot with the fried bread and black olives.
