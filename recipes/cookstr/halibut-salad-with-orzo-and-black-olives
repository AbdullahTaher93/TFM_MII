1 To prepare the fish, put the cubed halibut in a bowl and add the lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, mint sprigs, salt, and pepper. Turn the cubes to coat them. Cover and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes. 2 To prepare the orzo, in a bowl, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, Â½ teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper and stir to mix. 4 Prepare a medium-hot wood or charcoal fire in a grill, or preheat a gas grill or a broiler. Oil the grill rack, if grilling, or ready the broiler tray. 3 In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the orzo and cook until al dente, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well and place in a bowl. Pour the lemon juice combination over the warm orzo and turn to coat. Gently turn in the lemon zest, olives, mint, and parsley. Cover to keep warm. 5 Thread the halibut cubes onto about 8 skewers. Do not pack them too tightly. Place the skewers on the grill rack 5 to 6 inches from the heat source, or in the broiler at about the same distance from the heat, and grill, turning once, for about 5 minutes on each side. The fish should be just opaque at the center. Do not overcook. 6 Remove the fish from the fire and let rest for about 10 minutes. Slide the fish from the skewers. Arrange the orzo on a platter, and top with the fish. Serve warm or at room temperature.
