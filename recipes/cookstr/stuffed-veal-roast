The night before you plan to barbecue, combine the soak ingredients in a lidded jar. Place the roast in a plastic bag and pour the marinade over it, making sure some goes into the roast’s pocket. Refrigerate the meat overnight. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200°F to 220°F. Remove the roast from the refrigerator and drain the marinade, reserving it if you plan to baste the meat. Let the roast sit for 30 minutes at room temperature while you prepare the filling. In a skillet, fry the bacon over medium heat until browned and crispy. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, drain it, and place it in a medium bowl. Add the apple, onion, and garlic to the skillet and sauté until soft. Spoon the mixture into the bowl. Stir in the remaining filling ingredients and mix until well combined. Stuff the roast loosely with the filling. If you are using the mop, heat the marinade in a small saucepan. Bring the mop mixture, to a boil over high heat and boil for several minutes. Keep the mop warm over low heat. Warm a heavy skillet over high heat. Sear the meat quickly on both sides. Transfer the roast to the smoker. Cook for 1¾ to 2 hours, mopping every 20 to 30 minutes in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for your style of smoker. The roast is best when the internal temperature reaches 145°F to 150°F, or medium-rare. Remove the roast from the smoker and let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before carving. Slice the roast and serve.
