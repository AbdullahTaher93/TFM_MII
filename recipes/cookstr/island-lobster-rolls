In a bowl, toss the lobster meat with the dressing. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Drain the lobster and discard the dressing. Add the celery and mayonnaise and stir to combine, adding more mayonnaise if needed to moisten well. Melt the butter on a cast-iron griddle or in a large frying pan. Place the rolls in the butter, cut sides down, and toast over medium heat, turning once, until browned on both edges. Fill with lobster salad and serve.
