Place the onion in a strainer over a bowl in the sink. Pour the boiling water over the onion, remove the strainer from the bowl, and let it drain for at least 5 minutes. Combine the pineapple, lemon or lime juice, ginger, coconut, and chiles in a medium-sized bowl. Add the drained onion, and mix well. Chill. Serve cold, garnished with mint leaves, if desired. Store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
