Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and garlic and cook for about 3–4 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the mushrooms and cook for 5-6 minutes more. Add the stock and potatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 30 minutes. In batches, process in a blender or food processor with the lid ajar until coarsely puréed. Sprinkle in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot. Variation: As an extra flavor, add a spoonful of prepared horseradish to each bowl of soup.
