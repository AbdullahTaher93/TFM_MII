Put the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter in a mixing bowl. Stir briskly until the mixture is smooth and blended. Stir the flour, salt, and baking soda together in a small bowl so they are well blended. Stir into the buttermilk mixture only until the dry ingredients are moistened—leave the lumps. Heat a skillet or griddle to medium hot. Grease lightly and spoon out about 3 tablespoons of batter per pancake. Spread the batter with the back of the spoon so it is thinned out a little. Cook until a few bubbles break on top. Turn the pancake over and cook briefly. Keep pancakes warm until enough are cooked to serve. Rye Buttermilk Pancakes: Use ½ cup all-purpose flour and ¼ cup rye flour. Whole Wheat Buttermilk Pancakes: Replace up to ½ cup all-purpose flour with an equivalent amount of whole wheat flour. Yellow Cornmeal Buttermilk Pancakes: Substitute ¼ cup yellow cornmeal for ¼ cup of the flour in the recipe. Strawberry Whipped Cream Waffles: These linger in the minds of many as a Sunday morning treat when the family gathered around the breakfast table. They are traditionally served with lightly sweetened whipped cream piled on top of the hot, cooked waffles. With a mound of strawberries on top, this is a glorious sight. Waffles with Chopped Nuts: It is best to add chopped nuts to waffles when they have nearly finished cooking. Sprinkle about ¼ cup chopped nuts evenly over the top of the waffle about 30 seconds before it is done. Cornmeal, Buckwheat, or Rye Flour Waffles: Substitute ½ cup cornmeal, buckwheat flour, or rye flour for ½ cup of the all-purpose flour called for in the basic recipe.
