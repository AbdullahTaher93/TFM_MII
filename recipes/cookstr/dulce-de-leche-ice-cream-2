In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook condensed milk, stirring constantly, until thick and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Meanwhile, in a separate medium saucepan over medium-low heat, bring cream, milk and cinnamon stick to a simmer. Remove cinnamon stick. Very slowly and carefully to prevent spattering, pour condensed milk into a clean large bowl. Gradually whisk in cream mixture, holding the saucepan at arm’s length and averting your face when adding the cream. Whisk in vanilla. Cover and refrigerate until completely cold or overnight. Stir cream mixture. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer’s instructions. Variation: Traditional Dulce de Leche: If you’re not in an ice cream mood, do as they do in Latin American countries: cook the sweetened condensed milk down into dulce de leche and, instead of freezing it into ice cream, spread it on toast or your favorite pound cake. Serving suggestion: Line each cup of a muffin tin with plastic wrap. Pack with ice cream and freeze. Turn the individual portions out onto plates, drizzle with chocolate sauce and sprinkle with unsweetened cocoa powder.
