To prepare: Halve the avocados and remove the pits. Scoop out the pulp and chop without mashing. Sprinkle with the lim e jucie and salt to taste. Use right away. Or, to store, tuck the pits back into the avocado mixture, cover with plastic wrap, pressing down to eliminate air pockets, and refrigerate. The mixture will remain brightly colored for 1 day. To vary: Add about 1 teaspoon black pepper, stir in ¼ cup chopped cilantro leaves, add 2 to 3 minced scallions (green onions), or 1½ teaspoons minced jalapeños.
