Preheat the oven to 425°F. Place the potatoes in a large roasting pan along with the bay leaf and wine. If the wine does not completely cover the potatoes, add a little water. Season generously with salt and pepper. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Meanwhile, place the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for about 7 minutes or until the bits begin to get brown and crispy. Add the onions and cook until they become translucent, about 3 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oven. Using a slotted spoon, transfer potatoes to the skillet with the bacon and onions. Leave about ½ cup of the liquid in the roasting pan, pour the rest of the liquid into a bowl, and set aside. Stir the potatoes into the bacon and onion mixture and taste for seasoning. If there is a hard tough rind on the cheese, slice most of it off with a sharp knife and discard. Place one half of the cheese on the bottom of a round or oval gratin-style baking dish. Pour the potato mixture over and around the cheese. Place the top half of the cheese on the potato mixture. If the mixture seems a little dry, add some of the reserved wine and/or a little water. (If you are making this dish in advance, prepare it to this point and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature, then bake it until the potatoes are hot, about 20 minutes.) Bake for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are hot and the cheese is oozing and bubbling. Serve from the baking dish at the table.
