In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, garlic, and salt. Stir in the bread, zucchini, cheese (if you’re so inclined), and the sun-dried tomatoes and let the whole mixture soak for about 20 minutes. Pour into a baking dish or greased muffin pan and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.
