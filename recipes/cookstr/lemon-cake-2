In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the margarine and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the 1 teaspoon lemon zest and the tofu, and beat well. In a separate medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt with a wire whisk. Add the flour mixture to the margarine mixture, alternating the additions with the soy milk, and beat well. Stir in the lemon juice. Preheat oven to 350°F, and spray a 13×9-inch baking dish with dairy-free baking spray. Set aside. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until an inserted cake tester comes out clean. Cool completely. Combine the creamy glaze ingredients in a small bowl, and drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.
