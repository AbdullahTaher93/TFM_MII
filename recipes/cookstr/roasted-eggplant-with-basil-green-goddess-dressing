Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a rimmed baking sheet, toss the eggplant with the oil and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Arrange the cubes in a single layer and roast for 30 minutes, stirring once or twice. While the eggplant is roasting, make the dressing. In the bowl of a food processor, place the creme fralche, mayonnaise, anchovies, garlic, chives, parsley, basil, lemon juice, pepper, and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Run the motor until the mixture is fully combined and bright green. Serve the dressing alongside or drizzled over the eggplant.
