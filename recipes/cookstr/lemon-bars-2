Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C, or gas mark 4). Line an 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20 cm) glass baking dish with parchment paper, allowing the 1 paper to go up the edges of the dish. To make the crust: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the eggs, coconut oil, and honey and process until smooth. Add the coconut flour, 1/4 cup (20 g) of the shredded coconut. cinnamon. baking soda. and salt and process again until well combined. Remove the blade from the bowl and stir in the remaining ½ cup (40 g) shredded coconut. Press the crust evenly into the prepared baking dish and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the edges are just turning golden. Allow the crust to cool. To make the filling: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the lemon juice, lemon zest, eggs, honey. maple syrup, and sea salt. Slowly add the melted coconut oil while whisking constantly. Whisk until it starts to thicken-it should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. You don’t want to leave this unattended. Strain the filling through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any cooked egg bits. Stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the filling over the baked crust and sprinkle the top with the shredded coconut. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or best overnight, to allow the curd to set. Remove the bars from the baking dish by lifting up on the parchment paper, cut into sixteen 2 x 2-inch (5 x 5 cm) bars, and serve. Will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
