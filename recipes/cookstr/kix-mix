Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). In a small bowl, combine the garlic and onion powders, salt, pepper, and basil. Pour the cereals into a large bowl. Melt the butter and drizzle it over the cereals. Quickly add the spice mix and toss well to coat. Spread the cereal mixture evenly onto a 12 × 18-inch (30 × 45-cm) baking sheet and place it in the middle of the oven. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring twice so the edges don’t burn. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.
