Combine all ingredients except port and brandy in a large pot (not aluminum); bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; simmer for 10 minutes. Add port and brandy; heat just until steaming (don’t boil). Pour into large, heatproof bowl. Ladle into mugs or heatproof punch cups, adding a few spices and citrus strips to each serving. Strain leftover mulled wine, tightly seal, and store in a cool place for at least 6 months. Mulled Cider: Substitute 2½ quarts (10 cups) apple cider for the wine; omit port. If desired, substitute 1/3 cup honey for the brown sugar.
