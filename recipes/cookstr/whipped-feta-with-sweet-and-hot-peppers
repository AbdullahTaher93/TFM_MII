Place all the ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and combine them so that the sweet and hot peppers coat the cheese. In’ food processor, fitted with a metal blade, puree the mixture for about 2 minutes, until very smooth and creamy. The mixture will be quite loose, but it will set when it’s chilled in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before serving. Place the mixture in a crock and sprinkle it with a pinch of all three of the chilies to garnish and show them off.
