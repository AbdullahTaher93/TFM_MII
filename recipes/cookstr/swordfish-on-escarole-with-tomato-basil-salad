Make a small X on the bottom of each tomato with a sharp knife. Plunge them one at a time into a pot of boiling water for 30 seconds. Peel, seed, and chop. Combine all the ingredients for the Tomato-Basil Salad in a nonreactive bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use. Combine all the vinaigrette ingredients in a small bowl or measuring cup. Refrigerate until ready to use. Brush the swordfish with a little oil. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Place the fish on the grill over hot coals. Rotate the fish to crosshatch after 1 minute. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side, turning once. Cover to keep warm. Toss the escarole with the vinaigrette, mixing well. Place the escarole on individual plates and top with the swordfish set at an angle. Spoon 2 tablespoons Tomato-Basil Salad across half of each fish. Serve the remaining salad on the side.
