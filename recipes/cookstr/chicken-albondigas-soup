To make the albondigas, in a large bowl combine the chicken, bread crumbs, egg, cilantro, cumin, pepper, and a pinch of salt. Mix well with your hands. Lightly shape into 1-inch meatballs, packing lightly. In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil to sizzling. Sauté the meatballs in small batches until evenly browned. Drain on paper towels and reserve. To make the soup, heat the oil in a large skillet until hot. Add the rice and sauté about 30 seconds, stirring to coat all the grains. Add the garlic, celery, and onion and sauté until the onion is translucent. Transfer to a Dutch oven or large pot. Add the tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, broth, juice, cumin, cayenne, and salt to taste. Simmer for 45 minutes, partially covered, or until the vegetables are cooked. Add the albondigas a few at a time. Simmer an additional 5 minutes to heat through. Adjust the salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste. Ladle into serving bowls and top with a dollop of Crème Fraîche or sour cream.
