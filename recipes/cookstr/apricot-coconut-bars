Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). In a large bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, oat bran, wheat bran and baking soda. In a small bowl, combine margarine and oil. Stir into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve 1 cup (250 mL) crumb mixture. Press remaining crumb mixture into bottom of prepared pan. Set aside. In a large saucepan, over medium high heat, combine apricots and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 5 minutes, until softened. Meanwhile, combine sugar and flour. Stir into apricot mixture. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until thick. Stir in coconut. Spread apricot mixture over crumbs in the pan and sprinkle evenly with reserved crumb mixture. Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown on top. Let cool completely in pan on a wire rack, then cut into bars. Variation: Replace the apricots with your favorite dried fruit.
