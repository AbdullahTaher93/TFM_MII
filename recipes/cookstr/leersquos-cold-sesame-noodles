Boil the noodles in a large pot of well-salted water until tender. Drain, cool thoroughly in cold water, and drain again. Toss the noodles with the sesame oil. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. In a large bowl, combine the tahini, peanut butter, vinegar, Hunan pepper sauce, chile, sugar, chicken broth, and white pepper. Add the cold noodles and toss well. Add the cucumbers, scallions, and cilantro, toss well, and serve.
