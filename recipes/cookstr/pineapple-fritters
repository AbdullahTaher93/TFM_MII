To make the batter combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add the milk, 1 egg, and 1 egg yolk. Whisk quickly until smooth and lump-free. Beat the egg white until stiff peaks form, and fold gently into the batter. Add enough oil to come halfway up the sides of a large frying pan, and heat to 350°F (180°C) over high heat. Dip the pineapple into the batter, then carefully add to the oil. Deep-fry for about 3 minutes, or until golden brown on both sides. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Sift confectioner's sugar on top and serve hot. Variation: Banana Fritters Use 4 bananas, each cut in half lengthwise then in half crosswise, instead of pineapple.
