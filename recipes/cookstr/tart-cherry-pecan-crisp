Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. In a large bowl, combine the cherries and granulated sugar and mix well. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt and mix well. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender (or do so quickly using your fingers) until small peasized chunks form. Stir in the pecans. Place the cherry mixture in an 8- or 9-inch-square baking pan. Place the topping mixture on top of the cherries. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the topping is browned and the filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let stand 20 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
