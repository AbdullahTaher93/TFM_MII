Heat 2 tsp of oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes, until beginning to soften. Add the cherry tomatoes, chile, brown sugar, and cayenne and stir well to mix. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Cook 5 minutes, until the tomatoes soften. Transfer to a bowl and cool. Stir in the corn, ketchup, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Just before serving, stir in the cilantro. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
