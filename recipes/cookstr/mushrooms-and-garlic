In a large skillet, heat the butter over high heat. Working in batches if necessary, add only the number of mushrooms that will cover the bottom of the pan in one layer. Saut√© until browned, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and parsley and toss or stir quickly. Season with the salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and arrange on a serving platter or in a vegetable dish. Serve hot.
