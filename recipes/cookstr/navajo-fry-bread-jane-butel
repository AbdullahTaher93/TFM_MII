Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium-size bowl. Stir in warm water in small amounts until mixture reaches the consistency of bread dough. Knead thoroughly until smooth and elastic. Cover bowl and let dough rest 10 minutes. Heat 2 to 3 inches of lard or oil in a deep-fat fryer to 400°F (205°C). Pull off pieces of dough and form into 2-inch rounds. Roll out ¼-inch thick and about 8 to 10 inches in diameter on a board lightly dusted with cornmeal or flour. Make a hole in the center of each piece. Fry breads, one at a time, on each side until golden, piercing large bubbles with a meat fork as they occur. Serve hot.
