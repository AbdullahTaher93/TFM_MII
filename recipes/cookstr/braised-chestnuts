Add the butter, turn the heat up, and shake the pan so the chestnuts are well anointed with the butter. Serve hot. Creamed Chestnuts. Add ¼ cup heavy cream with the butter. Puréed Chestnuts. Put the buttered chestnuts through a food mill or purée them in a blender or food processor, beating in a little hot heavy cream if too thick.
