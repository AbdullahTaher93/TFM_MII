In a medium bowl, whisk together the shallots, vinegar, raspberry puree, orange juice, honey, and olive oil to make a smooth mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain the onions, pat dry, and separate into individual rings. Transfer the onion rings to a medium bowl and pour the vinaigrette over. Marinate the onions for at least 30 minutes covered in the refrigerator. On chilled plates, arrange the watercress and top with the cubed watermelon. Arrange the onions and figs attractively around and drizzle the vinaigrette over. Sprinkle mint leaves over the top and serve immediately.
