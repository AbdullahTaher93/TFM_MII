In a large, heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion, garlic, cinnamon, and nutmeg and cook slowly until the onion is translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the calabaza and broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the calabaza is very tender, about 40 minutes. In a blender or food processor with a steel knife blade, working in two or three batches, puree the calabaza mixture until smooth. Return the puree to the saucepan and stir in the cream. Season with salt and pepper and heat the soup gently, stirring often, until hot. Ladle the soup into 4 to 6 individual soup bowls, top each serving with a crouton, and sprinkle with parsley.
