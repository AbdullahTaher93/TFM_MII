To Make the Fresh Tomato Salsa: In a medium bowl, stir together all ingredients. Cover and let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour to allow flavors to blend, then cover and store in refrigerator until ready to use. Drain, if necessary, before using. Homemade salsa is best eaten the same day as prepared. To Make the Chicken: Preheat oven to 400Â°F. In a large shallow bowl, whisk together lime juice, honey, oil, salt, and pepper. Add chicken and turn to coat and let stand 10 minutes. Spread crushed chips on a large piece of waxed paper. Remove chicken from lime juice mixture, reserving leftover juice, and roll in chips to coat evenly. Place in a lightly sprayed or oiled 8-by-10-inch glass baking dish. Pour remaining juice over all. Bake until chicken is no longer pink in the center and coating is crisp, about 35 minutes. Transfer to a warm platter. Top each breast with a dollop each of salsa and sour cream and a few avocado slices. Garnish with lime wedges.
