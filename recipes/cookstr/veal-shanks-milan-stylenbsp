Spread the flour on a piece of wax paper. Dredge the veal in the flour, shaking off the excess. In a Dutch oven or other deep, heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid, melt the butter with the oil over medium heat. Add the veal and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Cook until browned, about 10 minutes. Turn the slices over with tongs and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Scatter the onion around the meat. Cook until the onion is tender and the meat is browned, about 10 minutes more. Add the wine and cook, scraping up and blending in the browned bits at the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in the tomatoes and broth and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat to low and partially cover the pan. Cook, basting the meat occasionally with the sauce, until the veal is tender and coming away from the bone when tested with a fork, 1Â½ to 2 hours. If there is too much liquid, remove the cover and allow it to evaporate. About 5 minutes before serving, mix together the garlic, parsley, anchovy (if using), and the lemon zest. Stir the mixture into the sauce in the pan and baste the meat. Serve immediately.
