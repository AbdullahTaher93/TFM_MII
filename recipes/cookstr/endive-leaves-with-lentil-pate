Bring the lentils and water to boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the salt and cook another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the lentils are very tender and the water is absorbed. In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onions, garlic, and salt, and saute for 10 minutes, or until the onions are translucent. Add the cumin, coriander, and tahini, and saute another 2 minutes while stirring often. Transfer the onion-garlic mixture to a food processor, along with the lentils and walnuts. Blend until smooth. Add the shoyu and let cool. Remove the leaves from the endives, discarding any that are discolored. Using only the leaves that are large enough to fill, pipe or spoon the pate onto the leaves. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve. Variations: • Use green or red lentils. • Substitute cashews or pecans for the walnuts. • Serve the pate with crackers or raw vegetables.
