Preheat grill or use broiler. Lightly brush the ears of corn and onion with oil. Place on grill or under broiler and grill until brown flecks appear on each. Meanwhile, reconstitute chipotles with a splash of vinegar (cider vinegar is best) and water to cover. In a microwave, place chiles in bottom of a 1-quart glass measuring cup, cover, and cook on high for five minutes, or for the stovetop, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Set aside. Cut corn off cob, reserving ¼ cup for garnish, and coarsely chop onion. Place one cup water in blender jar, add corn and onion, and process until puréed. Add chipotle chiles and process further. Place mixture in saucepan, add heavy cream, pepper, and cumin and simmer for about 15 minutes. While chowder is simmering, prepare topping by combining reserved grilled corn, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, jalapeño, vinegar, and honey. Taste and add salt, if desired. Ladle soup into individual bowls, top with a spoonful of topping, and serve immediately.
