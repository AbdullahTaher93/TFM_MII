Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Gradually add in the egg until it is fully incorporated. Sift in the flour and cocoa powder and mix on a slow speed until the ingredients begin to form a ball. Remove the dough from the bowl and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least an hour until firm. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C/gas mark 4). Allow the dough 10 soften slightly at room temperature, then roll it out on a lightly floured surface to the required thickness. Cut out shapes using a cutter, then carefully lift the cookies with a palette knife and place them, evenly spaced, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes until they are just firm to the touch. Allow the cookies to completely cool on a wire rack before decorating.
