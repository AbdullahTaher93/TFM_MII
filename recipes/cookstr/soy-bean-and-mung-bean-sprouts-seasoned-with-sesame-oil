Bring 12 cups of water to a boil in a 4-quart pot. Put in the soy-bean sprouts and boil rapidly for 10 minutes. Add the mung-bean sprouts and boil another 2 minutes. Drain thoroughly, squeezing out as much of the water as possible. Put the sprouts in a bowl. Add all the other ingredients and mix well. Taste for seasonings.
