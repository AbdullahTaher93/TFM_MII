Prepare the crêpes. Preheat the oven to 375°F. To make the filling: In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, goat cheese, Gruyère, Parmesan, egg, and nutmeg. Spoon one-eighth of the filling down the center of each crêpe and make an envelope fold. Arrange in a greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Brush the tops of the crêpes with the olive oil and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese. Bake in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Garnish with tomatoes and sprinkle with basil. Serve at once.
