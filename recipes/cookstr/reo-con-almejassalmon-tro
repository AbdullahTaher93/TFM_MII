In a cup, combine the wine and mustard. Heat the butter and oil in a skillet and very lightly sauté the trout on both sides. Remove to a warm platter (the fish will be partially cooked). In the same skillet put the garlic, the wine mixture, salt to taste, and the clams and simmer, removing the clams as they open. Return the clams and fish fillets to the skillet and continue cooking until the fish is done (a total time, including the sauté, of 5 minutes for each ½ inch of thickness), adding some Fish Broth as needed to maintain a small amount of sauce in the skillet. Spoon the sauce over the fish, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.
