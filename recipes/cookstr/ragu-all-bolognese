Mince the pancetta, oruon, carrot, and celery together. Set aside. Heat the olive oil in a medium-size earthenware, cast-iron, or other heavy-duty pot. Over low heat, cook the minced vegetable mixture very slowly, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Add the ground meat, salt, and pepper and brown the meat completely. Stir in the wine and let it completely evaporate. Stir in the tomatoes, cover the pot, and cook the ragu over very low heat for 45 minutes. Stir in the milk or cream and heat through.
