Bring potatoes to a boil in a large saucepan of salted water. Cook at a low boil over medium-low heat until just tender, 15 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain and let cool long enough to handle. Place onion in a small strainer and rinse under cold running water. Dry on paper towels. Lightly chop capers. Cut salami into small dice. Peel potatoes and slice into 1/3-inch-thick rounds. Lay slightly overlapping in a large shallow bowl. Scatter onion and capers over top. Drizzle with vinegar and gently toss with rubber spatula. Drizzle with olive oil and toss again. Season with salt and pepper to taste and toss. Serve at room temperature with salami scattered over top. Dress it up: Cut a large ripe tomato into thin slices, then cut each slice in half. Season them with salt and place them around the salad so the cut sides lie next to the potatoes. Fresh oregano scattered over the top is a nice addition, too.
