Boil the potatoes in their jackets until they are tender. In a sauté pan, bring the vinegar, wine, stock, and olive oil to a boil. Over low heat, slice the warm potatoes ¼ inch thick into the pan, add the preserved shallots, the chopped herbs, and some salt and pepper, and toss gently to combine. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl and serve warm.
