Coat the bottom and sides of slow cooker with a thin layer of oil. Put the rice, sugar, cardamom, raisins, and milk in the slow cooker. If you are using agave nectar, I recommend adding it toward the end, as adding it early makes the dish pinkish-brown in color. It will be delicious either way. Cook on high for 3 hours, stirring once or twice. Be careful not to let it overcook, or the milk will separate. If there is any browned milk caked on the sides, just scrape it out with a spoon and discard before serving. Sprinkle chopped almonds or pistachios across the top, and serve hot or cold.
