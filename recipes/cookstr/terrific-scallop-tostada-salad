Rinse the scallops and pat dry with a paper towel. Place the scallops on a paper plate, sprinkle with the rub, and toss to coat. Set aside. Preheat a heavy, seasoned, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; spray the skillet with nonstick spray if necessary. Quickly sear the scallops, stirring a few times to cook evenly, for 1½ to 2 minutes, just until done. They will seize up as they cook yet should still be moist and tender. To serve, divide the salad greens evenly among the plates, top each with the scallops, and drizzle each with 1 tablespoon of the dressing. Stab tostado triangles into the top, bottom, and each side of the salad at the 6, 9, 12, and 3 o’clock positions. Serve warm. 3.
