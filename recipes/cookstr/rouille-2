Quarter the potato and cook in the reserved broth. Drain, reserving the liquid. Finely chop the garlic and peppers in a blender or a food processor. Add the potato, Tabasco, and oil. Process until the mixture forms a paste. Slowly add enough of the reserved liquid to give the mixture the consistency of mayonnaise. Season with salt.
