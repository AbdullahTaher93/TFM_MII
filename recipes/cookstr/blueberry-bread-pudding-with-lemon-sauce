Make the Pudding: Preheat oven to 350°F and butter the sides and bottom of a 9 × 13-inch baking pan. Combine milk and light cream in saucepan; bring just to a boil. Remove from heat. Combine sugars, salt and cinnamon in a large bowl. Toss in bread pieces to coat. Lightly beat together the eggs and extra yolks and add to the large bowl. Add blueberries, apple, the hot creamy milk mixture and vanilla. Stir to combine. Allow mixture to sit for about five minutes. Pour into the prepared pan. Choose a shallow pan large enough to hold the baking pan (a small roasting pan is a good choice), and place your filled bread pudding pan into it. Pour boiling water into the larger pan so that it comes about halfway up the side of the other. Place in oven and bake the bread pudding in this water bath for about an hour, adding water if necessary. This procedure keeps the custard-like texture of the pudding from becoming tough. Remove from water bath and let bread pudding sit for approximately one-half hour before serving. Serve warm with lemon sauce on the side. Make the Lemon Sauce: Combine sugar, cornstarch and water in a double boiler over boiling water until thickened. Remove from heat and add remaining ingredients one at a time. Stir and adjust seasoning. Serve warm with bread pudding. Yields: 1½ Cups
