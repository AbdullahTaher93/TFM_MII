For the oven-dried tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 225°F. and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the tomato slices in a single layer on the paper, drizzle lightly with the olive oil, and sprinkle with the herbs. Roast 2 hours. They will shrink and darken slightly and be drier in appearance, but they will remain some what firm and moist. For the potato galettes: To slice potatoes easily, first cut an even lengthwise slice off the bottom, so the potato can stand firmly on a cutting board. Using a mandoline if possible, cut each potato into 1/8-inch slices; there should be about 32 in all. Brush a small nonstick skillet with about 1 teaspoon of clarified butter. Place over medium heat until hot, then arrange about 8 potato slices in the center, overlapping slightly to form a pancake. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Repeat with the remaining potato slices. Drain on paper towels. You may use a larger skillet and cook 2 or 3 galettes at a time. To serve: Preheat the oven to 200°F. Place the galettes on a baking sheet and top each with a slice of cheese and some dried tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Place in the oven until warmed through and the cheese has softened, 3 to 4 minutes. In a bowl, toss the mesclun with the sherry vinaigrette. Arrange each galette on an individual serving plate and top with the mesclun.
