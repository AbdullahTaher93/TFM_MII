Put the fennel and celery in a large bowl. Whisk together the vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, and tarragon in a small bowl. Slowly add the olive oil and whisk until emulsified. Pour half of the vinaigrette over the salad and toss to coat. Add the radishes and salt and pepper to taste and toss again. Drizzle a bit of the remaining vinaigrette over the salad and sprinkle the cheese over the top. Drizzle with a bit more vinaigrette and add more fresh pepper, if desired. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
