If you’re using whole cumin, toast the seeds in a dry frying pan over medium heat, shaking the pan, until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Grind 2 teaspoons of the cumin seeds to a powder in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle and set aside. Stir together the ginger, garlic, flour, ground cumin, pepper, Garam Masala, and turmeric in a bowl large enough to hold the shrimp. Stir in the lemon juice and then the yogurt, a bit at a time, stirring until smooth after each addition. Add the shrimp and toss to coat with the marinade. Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours; overnight is fine. Preheat the oven to 550°F, or as near that temperature as you can get it. Put the shrimp in a single layer on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan, sprinkle with salt, and roast 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest 15 minutes, then brush with the melted butter and roast another 10 minutes, until cooked through. Arrange the shrimp on a platter, sprinkle with the reserved toasted cumin seeds and squeeze the lemon juice over all. Serve hot. 3.
