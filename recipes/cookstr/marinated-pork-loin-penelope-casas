Combine in a bowl the marinade ingredients. Add the meat and turn to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate at least 24 hours, turning occasionally. Cut the meat in Â½-inch slices, allowing some of the marinade to cling t the meat. Coat a skillet or griddle with olive oil and heat to the smoking point. Brown the meat on both sides, reduce the flame to medium, and continue cooking until the meat is just done.
