Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter a baking dish. Arrange the fillets in one layer in the baking dish. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Divide the crabmeat among the four fillets, arranging it on top of the fish. Then arrange a row of alternating orange and grapefruit segments on each fillet. Drizzle orange juice over each. Blend the butter and bread crumbs, and sprinkle over the citrus segments. Bake until the fillets are cooked through and the crumbs are crisp and golden, 15 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh mint, and serve immediately.
