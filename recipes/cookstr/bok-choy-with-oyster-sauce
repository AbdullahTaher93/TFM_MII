Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, add the bok choy, and blanch for 1 minute. Drain and rinse under cold water to preserve the bright green color of the leaves. Gently squeeze each bok choy to remove excess water. Mix together the stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce, rice wine, and sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle in the cornstarch and stir until dissolved. Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and garlic and stir-fry for 15 seconds. Add the bok choy and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the stock mixture and stir until the sauce has thickened and coats the bok choy. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot.
