Cut chilies in lengthwise strips. Place water and chilies in a medium saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, 5 minutes or until chiles are soft. Stir in cheese, butter, garlic, and salt. Cook, covered, 2 minutes more. Remove from heat, stir in green onions, cover, and let sit a few minutes, until mixture develops a paste consistency. Serve over rice.
