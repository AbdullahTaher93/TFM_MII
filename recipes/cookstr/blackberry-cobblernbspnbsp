Preheat the oven to 400°. Toss together the berries and sugar in the casserole. Place in the oven for 20 minutes, until the sugar melts and the berries soften. Meanwhile, prepare the biscuit dough. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients. Gradually pour in the cream and mix into a sticky dough. Remove the casserole from the oven and spoon the biscuit dough over the berries. Reduce the heat to 350° and bake from 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cobbler is golden brown. Serve warm with heavy cream.
