The Process Heat the grill. Coat the roast with oil and vinegar, then add salt, pepper and rosemary. Place the beef on the grill and cook to desired temperature (I suggest medium rare). Let the meat stand for a few minutes. Slice thin and serve with a final drizzle of the balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle with parsley and more rosemary if desired. I also like to top it with sautéed garlic and hot chili flakes that have been lightly sautéed in two tablespoons extra virgin olive oil.
