Trim the ends of the plantains, but do not peel. Cut into pieces about 5 inches (13 cm) long. Put into a saucepan, cover with water, cover, and bring to a simmer. Continue cooking over medium heat until the flesh is soft-the skin will probably split open-about 1 hour. Drain and set aside to cool. Peel the plantains, and break into the container of a food processor. Add the flour and salt and process to a fairly smooth consistency. Heat the oil in a skillet-it should be about ¾ inch (2 cm) deep-over low heat. Wet your palms a little and divide the mixture into eight equal parts. Roll one into a ball about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Press it out either with your hands or with a tortilla press lined with plastic bags to a circle about 4 inches (10 cm) across and ¼ inch (.75 cm) thick. Put about 1 scant tablespoon of the cheese across the center of the dough, but not right to the edge. Again wet or lightly oil your palms, and form the dough into a banana shape about 5 inches (13 cm) long and 1¼ inches (3.25 cm) wide. The oil should now be hot but not exceed 250°F (120°C) or the outside will brown too much while the inside is still raw. Fry two or more of the bananas, depending on the size of the pan-remember that you need plenty of room to turn them over as they tend to stick to the bottom of the pan. Fry for a few seconds, then start to roll them over from time to time until they are an even, golden brown color-10 to 12 minutes. Remove and drain. (see Notes) Serve hot for a snack.
