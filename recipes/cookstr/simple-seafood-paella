Place the shrimp and scallops in a bowl. Sprinkle with the paprika, turmeric, black pepper, and salt, if desired, and stir to coat. Place the broth in a 4-quart pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the shrimp, scallops, onion, garlic, and rice, and stir to mix. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the bell pepper and parsley to the rice mixture, stir once, and continue to simmer covered for 5 to 7 additional minutes, or until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Serve immediately.
