Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a shallow baking pan large enough to fit the portobellos in 1 layer. Carefully remove the stems from the mushrooms and either discard or save for another use. Using a teaspoon, scrape the black fan-like ridges off the underside of the mushrooms, taking care not the break the caps. Brush each mushroom with ½ teaspoon olive oil and place on the baking dish, cap side down. Sprinkle each with 1 teaspoon Parmesan and spread 3 tablespoons tomato sauce over each mushroom. Place 3 basil leaves on each mushroom and season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons mozzarella over each mushroom. Bake until the cheese melts and the mushrooms are firm but tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.
