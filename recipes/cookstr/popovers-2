Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Remove the top rack from the oven; the popovers will be baked on the lower rack. Grease each cup of the popover pan generously. (If using iron muffin pans, place them in the oven to preheat and butter them carefully once hot.) Using a rotary beater or a whisk, beat all of the ingredients together until smooth. Using a ladle, fill the prepared cups halfway full with batter. Bake in the bottom third of the oven for about 30 minutes, or until the popovers are golden and light. Serve at once; they fall quickly.
