Add the pasta, stir, and cook according to the package instructions, until al dente, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain the pasta and put it in a large bowl, toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Heat the remaining olive oil and the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the flour and cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes, just to cook the flour slightly, do not let it brown. Whisk in the milk and cream and cook, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. 5. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the cheddar, Parmesan, chicken, marjoram, hot sauce, salt and pepper. 6. Add the cheese chicken mixture to the pasta and toss to coat the pasta evenly. Place in the prepared baking dish, scraping all the sauce from the bowl, and bake for about 45 minutes or until it is bubbling around the edges and slightly brown on top. Remove from the oven and let stand for about 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm. 6. Add the cheese chicken mixture to the pasta and toss to coat the pasta evenly.
