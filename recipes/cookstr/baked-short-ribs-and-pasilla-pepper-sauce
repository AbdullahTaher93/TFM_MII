Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F. To rehydrate the pasilla pepper, place it in a bowl, cover with boiling hot water, and soak for 5 minutes. To prepare the ribs, season with salt and pepper on both sides. Put a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, then add the ribs, fat side down. Cook turning once, until browned on all sides, for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the ribs to a plate and reserve. Meanwhile, in a 5/2-quart Dutch oven add the oil and butter and, heat over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until they start to soften, for about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the pureed roasted red peppers, pasilla pepper, tomato sauce, red wine, star anise, cinnamon, five-spice powder, and bay leaves. Add the short ribs back to the pot, and wrap the lid with a slightly damp kitchen towel, pulling tight, placing the corners on top of the pot. Do not let the towel fall into the dish. Put the Dutch oven in the preheated oven on the middle rack. Cook until the meat falls apart easily with a fork, about 1½ to 2 hours. Serve on a plate with buttered egg noodles.
