Add 1 cup of water (or the minimum amount required by your cooker to reach pressure) to the pressure cooker base. Cut the florets from the cauliflower and cut them into l-inch pieces; reserve the stems for another use. Place the florets in the steamer basket and lower it into the cooker. Sprinkle with the salt. Close and lock the lid of the pressure cooker. Cook at high pressure (see Notes) for 3 minutes/all cooker types. When the time is up, open the cooker with the Normal Release method (see Notes). Turn on the broiler. Lift the steamer basket out of the cooker, tumble the florets into a heat-proof serving dish or individual ramekins, and sprinkle with the bread crumbs, cheese, and pine nuts. Place under the broiler until the cheese is bubbling and just starting to turn golden (about 5 minutes).
