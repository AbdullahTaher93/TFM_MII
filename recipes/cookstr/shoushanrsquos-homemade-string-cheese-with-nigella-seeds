Cut the mozzarella curd into small pieces and place them in a Teflon pan. Add the salt and nigella seeds. Heat the cheese on low, stirring, until it is melted thoroughly and there are no lumps left. Remove the cheese from the heat and drain off the excess water in a colander. While the cheese is still very warm but cool enough to handle, pick it up in a large lump and poke a hole in the center with your fingers, so that the cheese resembles a large doughnut. You will need to work very quickly at this point because the cheese cools down rapidly once it has been stretched. Youâ€™ll have about 3 minutes to stretch the cheese. Grab it with both hands and stretch it so that it forms a large loop. Stick your finger through each end of the loop, and very quickly start winding the two strands of the loop around each other, as if you were making a rope while winding. Keep stretching the cheese gently, almost to the breaking point. The more you stretch, the stringier the cheese will be. When finished, you should have a length of cheese that resembles a thick rope or a tightly wrung-out dish cloth. Twist the ends of the cheese in opposite directions and intertwine the rope into a braid. Place one end through the loop of the other to lock it. Set the cheese aside in the refrigerator or in a cool room for about an hour to dry thoroughly. Wrap the cheese in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze it; it will keep for a week in the refrigerator and up to 2 months in the freezer. To serve the cheese, open the braid, cut one loop, and pull the cheese apart into thin strands. Serve with pita bread.
