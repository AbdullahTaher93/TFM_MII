For the split peas Heat the olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. When the butter has melted, add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the onion, celery, and carrot, and cook until they start to turn golden. Add the cayenne and cumin, stir, and add the chicken stock, ham hock, bay leaf, and peas. Bring to a simmer, turn down the heat, and simmer gently until the peas are tender, about 45 minutes. Remove the ham hock and bay leaf and coarsely mash the peas. Set aside; the mixture will thicken as it cools. While it does, prepare the pork chops. For the pork chops Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine the cumin, cardamom, coriander, cayenne, salt, pepper, and lemon zest. Sprinkle over the pork chops, rubbing it into both sides. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and sear the chops on both sides. As they brown, transfer them to a baking sheet. Put the chops in the oven and bake to desired doneness, 140 degrees for medium, 150 degrees for well-done. Meanwhile, gently reheat the peas. Serve, using the split peas as a sauce.
