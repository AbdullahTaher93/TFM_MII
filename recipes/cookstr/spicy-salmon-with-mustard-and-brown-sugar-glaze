Preheat the oven to 300Â°F. Heat the wine, butter, Old Bay Seasoning, capers, and cayenne in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle the salmon on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the fish in a glass baking dish. Pour the wine mixture over the top, and bake until fish is opaque in the center, 15 to 17 minutes; remove from the oven. Preheat the broiler. Whisk together the mustard and sugar in a small bowl; spread over the salmon to cover. Broil the salmon until the topping is brown and bubbling, about 3 minutes. Transfer the salmon to a platter and serve.
