In a medium bowl, whisk ¼ teaspoon salt with the lemon juice until dissolved. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Taste, and season with pepper and a little more salt, if needed. Add more lemon juice if the dressing tastes too flat. Variations: Toss with your favorite greens and serve with any sautéed or seared and roasted fish. Depending on the tartness of the lemons, you may need a little more or less olive oil in the vinaigrette.
