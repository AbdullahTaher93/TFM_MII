In a heavy pot over low heat, simmer the pork in 3 quarts cold water for 1 hour. Remove and discard the pork and skim the broth. This stock can be prepared 1 day ahead of time and refrigerated until needed. In a nonreactive large pot, warm the broth. Add the greens, cover the pot, and simmer for 20 minutes. Check a few leaves to see if they are tender: Young greens may be nice and soft after 30 minutes; older ones can require up to 2 hours of simmering. When the greens are soft, taste. Add salt if needed. Serve the greens hot with relish or fresh sliced onions and vinegar.
