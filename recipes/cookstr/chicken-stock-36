Put the chicken bones in a large stockpot and add 4 quarts cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any impurities as they rise to the top. Just as the water comes to a boil, add the onions, carrots, celery, and bay leaves. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for about 4 hours or until the stock has a nice, rich flavor. Turn off the heat and let the simmering subside. Pour the stock though a fine mesh strainer, discarding the solids. Cool the stock to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate. Remove any solidified fat from the top before using. The stock will keep refrigerated for up to 3 days or can be frozen for up to 6 months.
