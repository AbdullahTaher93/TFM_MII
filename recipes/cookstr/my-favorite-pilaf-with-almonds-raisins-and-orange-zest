Melt the butter in a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the carrots and stir over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Stir in the almonds, orange zest, raisins, and turmeric, and continue to stir for another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rice and keep on stirring until the rice is well coated with the butter and takes on some color, 2 minutes. Pour in the boiling stock in a steady stream and let boil for about 2 minutes. Add salt, reduce the heat to very low, cover tightly, and simmer until all the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork, transfer to a serving platter, and stir gently before serving.
