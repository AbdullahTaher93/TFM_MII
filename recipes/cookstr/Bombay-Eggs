In a large, lidded saucepan, toast the cumin and coriander seeds over a medium to high heat, swirling the pan around until the spices are a pale golden brown. It should take 2 to 3 minutes. Then lightly grind them in a mortar and pestle. Pour the oil into the pan on a medium heat and, when it's hot, put the spices back into the pan. Stir-fry for a minute, then add the onions. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until they're starting to turn golden, then add the garlic and ginger. Cook for another couple of minutes before adding the chopped tomatoes. Let the tomatoes cook and reduce for around 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they have thickened into a rich, bright sauce. Then add the tomato paste, salt, sugar, chili powder, and turmeric, mix well, and leave for a minute. Add the spinach, handful by handful, mix again, and leave the spinach to wilt in the sauce. To bake the eggs, have them all ready to crack and put into the pan in quick succession. Make your first egg-sized well in the tomato sauce using the back of a wooden spoon and crack an egg into it. Then repeat as quickly as you can for the other eggs and put the lid on the pan. Turn the heat down really low and cook for 10 minutes, or until the whites of the eggs are set but the yolks still creamy. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of pepper, the cilantro, a dollop of yogurt, and some hunks of bread.
