The soufflé: Preheat the oven to 350°. Butter and sugar a large deep baking dish. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with ¾ cup of the sugar, the vanilla, and spices until thick, creamy, and lemony in color. Mix in the milk. Place the cubed bread in a large bowl and pour the yolk/milk mixture over the bread. Set aside for 45 minutes. In a bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt and the remaining ¼ cup sugar until stiff, glossy peaks form. Stir in the sultanas and pecans into the soaked bread and fold in the meringue. Turn the mixture into the prepared mold and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until puffed and golden. The whiskey sauce: Heat the cream over simmering water in a double boiler. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until thick. Off the heat, whisk the yolks into the heated cream. Return the mixture to the double boiler and cook over simmering water, whisking constantly, until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Slowly add the bourbon and continue to cook until lightly thickened and smooth. Serve warm with the soufflé.
