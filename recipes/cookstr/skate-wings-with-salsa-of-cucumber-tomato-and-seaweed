Combine 1/4, cup of the oil and the jalapeno chiles in a heavy medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat. Steep to infuse the oil with the chiles, about 30 minutes. Strain to remove the chiles. Return the jalapeno oil to the saucepan. Add the tomatoes, cucumber, crabmeat, seaweed, lemon juice, chives, vinegar, and dill to the jalapeno oil. Season the salsa to taste with fleur de sel and pepper. Stir over low heat just until heated through, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, sprinkle the skate fillets with fleur de sel and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in each of 2 heavy large saute pans over high heat. Add 2 skate fillets to each saute pan and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Using a large metal spatula, turn the skate fillets over and cook until they are golden brown and just opaque in the center, about 3 minutes longer. Spoon the salsa over 4 large plates. Top with the skate fillets, sprinkle on the chopped green bell pepper, and serve immediately.
