Combine the brown rice flour and salt in a large bowl In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the palm oil until softened, about 1 minute. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture slowly until incorporated. Add the agave syrup and water and mix until a soft dough has formed, about 5 minutes. If the dough is dry, add additional water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is smooth. For a double-crust pie, set aside and cover half of the dough. There is no need to refrigerate it. Dust your work surface (a 12- by 18-inch cutting board or piece of cardboard covered in parchment paper works well) and your hands liberally with brown rice flour. Place the dough on your work surface and sprinkle the top with more brown rice flour. Roll the dough into an 11-inch disc. Place your pie plate on top of the rolled-out dough. With one hand under the work surface and the other on the pie plate, flip them so that the cutting board is on top. Set the pie plate on the counter, remove the cutting board, and gently press the pie dough into the pie plate. Any tears that occur can be fixed by gently pressing and pinching the dough back together. For a single-crust pie, decoratively flute the perimeter of the pie crust by pressing a fork along the edge or using your thumb and forefinger to pinch the edge. For a double-crust pie, roll out the second half of the crust in the same manner. After adding filling to the bottom crust, slide the top crust onto the pie. Seal the perimeter by pressing a fork along the edge or using your thumb and forefinger to pinch the edge over the par-baked bottom crust.
