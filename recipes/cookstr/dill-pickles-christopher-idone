In the stoneware crock, combine the pickling salt with 2 quarts cold water. Add the cucumbers and soak for 24 hours. When ready to put up: Bring a large kettle of water to a boil. In a large non-aluminum saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, and 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Remove the Kirbys from the brine with a slotted spoon and drain. Plunge the cucumbers into the pot of boiling water. Drain immediately and pack the Kirbys into sterilized jars. Divide the garlic, spices, and dillweed equally among the jars, filling up to within 1 inch from the top. Pour in the hot vinegar liquid to reach 1/2-inch from the top of each jar. Tightly seal the jars. Place the jars on a rack in the kettle, making sure they do not touch. Add enough hot water to cover the lids by 2 inches. Cover and bring to a boil. Continue to boil for 15 minutes if using pint-size jars, or 20 minutes, if packed into quarts. Remove the jars from the water bath with the canning tongs and set on a rack to cool. Store in a cool place.
