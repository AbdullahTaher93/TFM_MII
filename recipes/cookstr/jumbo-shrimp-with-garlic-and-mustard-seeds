Crush a teaspoon of the mustard seeds in a mortar and pestle until the black skins split to reveal their yellow insides. Put a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat and, when it's nice and hot, add the butter. When the butter foams, add a teaspoon of the whole mustard seeds and wait for them to pop. This should happen after around 20 seconds in a hot pan; if not, move on, as you don't want them to burn and taste bitter. Add the curry leaves if you are using them and the garlic and stir-fry for a couple of minutes. Now add the cracked mustard seeds, the salt, chili powder, red chili, and turmeric to the pan and stir-fry for a few seconds. Add the shrimp and stir. It should only take a minute or so for them to turn pink; as soon as they do, take them off the heat. Squeeze the lemon over the shrimp and garnish with the scallions. Eat with rice or chapatis and a hearty salad.
