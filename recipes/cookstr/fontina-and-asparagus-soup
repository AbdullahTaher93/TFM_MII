In a large soup pot, melt butter over medium-high heat. Sprinkle with flour and sauté until foamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, stock, salt, cayenne and nutmeg; reduce heat and simmer, whisking, until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add asparagus and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Using an immersion blender, or in a food processor or blender in batches, pureé soup until smooth. Return to the pot, if necessary. Add cheese, ½ cup (125 mL) at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon after each addition until cheese is melted. Return pot to low heat, if necessary, to keep soup hot and melt cheese. Do not let boil. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Ladle into heated bowls and garnish with croutons.
