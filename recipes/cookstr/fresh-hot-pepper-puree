Wash the peppers thoroughly in cold water. With a sharp knife, trim the ends and cut them in half lengthwise. With a paring knife, scrape the seeds out and cut the peppers into small pieces. Transfer to a blender, add the water and salt, and process until smooth. Add a little more water, if needed, to make a thick sauce. Transfer to small containers and refrigerate for up to several days or freeze for up to several months.
