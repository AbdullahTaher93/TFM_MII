In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup of the water with the ginger and sugar, and cook over a medium flame, stirring frequently, until the sugar has dissolved. Let cool to room temperature. Strain into a pitcher. Add the remaining water, lemon juice, and lime juice, and either refrigerate for up to one week, or mix with the vodka for immediate serving. Fill four glasses with crushed ice. Add 2 ounces of vodka to each glass. Fill three-quarters of the way with the ginger-lemonade mixture. Stir and top with club soda. Garnish and serve.
