Prepare ahead The shallots can be cooked a few hours in advance, and gently reheated before serving. Melt 2 tbsp of the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes, until golden. Add the red wine, vinegar, sugar, thyme, and bay leaf, and season with salt. Partially cover and simmer over a low heat for 30 minutes, or until tender. Transfer the shallots to a serving bowl, using a slotted spoon. Increase the heat to high and boil the cooking liquid until syrupy. Remove from the heat and whisk in the remaining butter. Discard the bay leaf and thyme sprig, and pour the sauce over the shallots; serve immediately.
