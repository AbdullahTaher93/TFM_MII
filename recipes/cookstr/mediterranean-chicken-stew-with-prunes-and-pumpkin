Heat the olive oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium high heat. While the oil is heating season the chicken with half the cumin, paprika, salt and pepper and place in the skillet to sear on both sides, working in batches not to overcrowd the pan. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. Reduce the heat to low and add the onion and pumpkin; cook and stir about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, remaining cumin, paprika, salt and pepper and cook, stirring constantly about 1 minute. Stir in the broth, orange zest, orange juice and rosemary. Return the chicken to the skillet, add the prunes and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat to simmer and cook about 30 minutes, until the chicken and pumpkin are tender and cooked through. 4. Stir in the parsley and mint just before serving and serve warm on a bed of jasmine rice or couscous.
