Add the pork tenderloin to the simmering bean mixture and cook for 10 minutes more, or until the meats are tender and the beans are very soft. Wipe out the frying pan. Add the remaining oil and heat over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the chorizo and chile, if using, and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring often. Add 3 tbsp of the cooked beans and mash well with the back of a spoon. Stir the mashed beans and sausage to the pot of beans, and cook for 10 minutes. To serve, remove the larger pieces of meat and cut them up. Spread the beans in a wide serving bowl, and top with the meats. Garnish with the orange wedges and scallions and serve hot. Variation Quick Pork and Bean Stew Delete the dried beans.
