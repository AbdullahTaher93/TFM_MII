Heat the oil in a 6-quart braising pot over high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the onions. Cook until light brown, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Move the onions to a platter. Spread the rice bran on a newspaper or large sheet of parchment and dredge the chicken in it. Working in small batches (3 to 4 pieces at a time), brown each piece of chicken in the hot oil, then move to a platter when done. When finished browning the chicken, reduce the heat to low and return the onions and chicken to the pot. Add the mushrooms, yellow peppers, garlic, apricots, lemon wedges, cinnamon, and harissa. Pour in the chicken stock and stir to combine. Cover the pot and cook for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes more. Season with the lemon juice and salt to taste. Serve with a bowl of quinoa and almonds on the side for people to add if they wish.
