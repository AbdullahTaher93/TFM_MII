Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. One tablespoon at a time, beat in the sugar, and beat until the mixture is stiff and glossy. Fold in the almond flour, rice flour, and almond extract. Line a large baking sheet with wax paper. Using a rounded teaspoon for each cookie, drop 24 mounds of the batter, spaced well apart, on the baking sheet. Top each mound with a blanched almond. Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the cookies are pale gold. Cool the macaroons on the baking sheet. Carefully peel the cookies from the paper. Store in an airtight container. Variation: Hazelnut Macaroons Substitute hazelnut flour (hazelnut meal), hazelnut or vanilla extract, and peeled hazelnuts for the almond flour, almond extract, and blanched almonds.
