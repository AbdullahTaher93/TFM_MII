Melt the chocolate in a small heavy saucepan over very low heat, stirring frequently. Stir in the coffee and vanilla until smooth. Add the milk, increase the heat to medium, and heat until the mixture is quite hot but not boiling. Pour the mixture into a blender container and whizz until frothy. Pour the chocolate into 2 cups and sprinkle each with a light dusting of nutmeg. Serve at once.
