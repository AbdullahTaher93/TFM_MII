Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Cut each potato into 1/2-inch (1 cm) thick slices. Cut each slice lengthwise into 1/2-inch (1 cm) strips. Place in a shallow bowl or plastic bag. Add oil, garlic, tarragon and a dash of salt and pepper. Toss until coated. Spread on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender, turning once.
