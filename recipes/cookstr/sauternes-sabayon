Cook the sabayon (see the Note on Egg Yolk Foams and Sabayons, below): In the bowl of a bain-marie, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Whisk in the sweet wine and salt and place the bowl over the simmering water. Whisk briskly until the mixture has thickened, tripled in volume, and holds the lines of a whisk, 5 to 10 minutes. As you whisk your sabayon you will smell the alcohol in the sauternes evaporating. Finish the sabayon: Remove the sabayon from the heat and cool slightly. If you would like it finished with cream, allow the sauce to cool completely and fold in the lightly whipped cream. Serving Suggestions: If you would like to serve it in the classic Italian style (zabaglione made tableside), then serve it immediately.
