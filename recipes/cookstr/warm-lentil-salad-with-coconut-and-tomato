Combine the oil, the mustard seeds, if using, and yellow split peas in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or casserole over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until the mustard seeds crackle and/or the dal begins to color, 1 to 2 minutes. (Cover the pan if using mustard seeds; they pop and splatter.) Add the cumin and cook, stirring, until the cumin turns golden brown, about 1 minute. Add the dried chiles, and the curry leaves and asafetida, if using, and cook, stirring, about 1 more minute. (Stand back if using curry leaves; they spit when they hit the oil.) Add the fresh chile, onion, and salt and cook until the onion softens, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the coconut, if using, and cook, stirring, until it turns golden brown, about 2 more minutes. Add the tomato and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the cooked lentils, lemon juice, and cilantro and stir until the lentils are warmed through. Taste for salt. Spoon the salad into a serving bowl and serve warm or at room temperature.
