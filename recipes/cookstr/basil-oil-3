Loosely pack the basil in a clean quart jar, leaving about an inch of space at the top. Add enough oil to cover (still allowing an inch of space). Using a butter knife, gently press down the basil to eliminate any air pockets. Put the cap on the jar, and add a label that includes the contents, date prepared, and approximate date the oil will be ready (2 to 6 weeks from the preparation date). Place the jar on a small plate and set on a windowsill. After 2 weeks, taste the oil. If stronger flavor is desired, let it continue to steep. Continue to check once a week. When the oil is ready, pour it through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a bowl, wide-mouth jar, or measuring cup. Before discarding the strained basil leaves (or saving for later use), either squeeze them with your hands (with or without the cheesecloth) or press them against the strainer with the back of a spoon to get every last drop of oil. Transfer the oil to a clean bottle or jar with a lid or cork, and label it with the type of oil and date. Store in a cool dry place, where it will keep for at least a year. For A Change: â€¢ Add a bay leaf or chili pepper for added flavor interest.
