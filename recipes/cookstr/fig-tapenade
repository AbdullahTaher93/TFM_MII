Stem and cut the figs crosswise into ¼-inch slices. Put them in a saucepan with the cognac and stock. Gently simmer 10 minutes, or until the figs are soft. Meanwhile, pit the olives. Transfer the figs with a slotted spoon to a food processor, reserving the poaching liquid. Add the olives, anchovies, and capers, and process to a smooth paste. Add the mustard, lemon juice, and oil, and process to combine. With the motor running, add enough fig-poaching liquid (½, to 1 cup) to obtain a soft, spreadable puree. Correct the seasoning with salt, pepper, and lemon juice: the tapenade should be highly seasoned. Transfer the tapenade to a serving bowl and serve with the toast points or bread.
