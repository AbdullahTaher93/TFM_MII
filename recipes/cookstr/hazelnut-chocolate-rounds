Preheat oven to 350 degrees Prepare 2 cookie sheets. Beat the butter and sugar until light and creamy. Add the hazelnuts. Sift the flour and salt together and beat it into the butter-and-nut mixture. Add the melted chocolate. Chill the dough for at least 2 hours. Dust your hands with flour and break off 1-inch pieces of dough and roll them into balls. Roll these into ropes and pinch the ends of the ropes together to form small circles. Bake for 20 minutes. Cool on a cookie rack and store in an airtight container, preferably in the refrigerator.
