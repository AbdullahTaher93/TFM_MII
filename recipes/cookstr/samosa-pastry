In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Add butter and, using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Drizzle cream evenly over mixture and mix lightly with a fork. Pinch a small quantity of dough between your thumb and fingers. If it doesn’t hold together, add more cream, 1 tbsp (15 mL) at a time, until it does. Knead until smooth. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Divide dough into 4 batches. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each batch, one at a time, very thinly into a large circle. Place a small plate (5 inches/12.5 cm in diameter) on top of circle and, using a sharp knife, cut out rounds of dough (you should get 3 rounds per large circle). Cut circles in half. Repeat until all dough is rolled out, yielding 24 half circles. If necessary, reroll scraps. When you’re ready to fill the samosas, combine cornstarch and water and mix well. Set aside. Working with one half circle at a time, moisten half of the straight edge with cornstarch solution. Fold in half, matching the dry straight edge with the wet one and keeping rounded edge open to form a cone. Pinch straight edge to seal. Holding the cone upright, fill with about 2 tbsp (30 mL) of filling. Moisten the inside edge of one side of the rounded top with cornstarch solution, pinch edges together and fold over the cone. Press firmly to seal. Repeat until dough and filling are used up. Place on a tray, wrap in plastic and refrigerate the prepared samosas for up to 8 hours. When you’re ready to serve the samosas, preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Make the egg wash by beating egg and cream in a small bowl. Place samosas on prepared baking sheet and brush tops with egg wash. Bake until top is just turning golden, about 10 minutes. Flip samosas over and brush other side with egg wash. Bake until nicely golden, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.
