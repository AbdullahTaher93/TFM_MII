Make the Beer Batter, strain it, and let it rest while you prepare the Quick Herb Sauce. Combine the seasoned flour as directed in the Beer Batter recipe. Preheat the oven to 225°F. Heat a griddle or cast-iron frying pan over high heat until hot; reduce the heat to medium-high. Brush the outsides of the rolls with melted butter and toast on the griddle, turning on all sides until golden, 4 to 6 minutes total. Keep the rolls warm in the oven while you fry the clams. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep saucepan to 375°F. Drain the clams and pat dry. Working with about one-fourth of the clams at a time, dip them in the flour mixture, shake off the excess, then dip them in the batter to coat them and let the excess drip off. Add the clams to the oil and deep fry until they are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining clams. Spoon a little on the toasted rolls. Divide the clams among the rolls. Top each with some lettuce and serve with a lemon wedge.
