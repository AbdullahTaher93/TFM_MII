Put the bowl of acidulated water near the work area, and begin to trim the artichokes. First cut off the top of an artichoke to flatten, then remove all the tough bracts (outer leaves). Trim the woody end of the stem and carefully peel the skin around it. Cut the artichoke in half length wise and remove the inner hairy choke, leaving the soft, edible bracts attached to the artichoke. Cut the artichoke heart lengthwise into Â¼-inch slices. Put the slices in the acidulated water to prevent the artichoke meat from discoloring. Trim and slice the second artichoke. Remove the artichoke slices from the water and transfer them to a medium bowl. Add the fresh lemon juice, olive oil, and salt. Toss gently and let stand for 30 minutes before serving. This dish will last for about 3 days in the refrigerator.
