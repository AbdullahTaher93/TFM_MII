Combine the lentils with 1 cup water in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the lentils are al dente, or slightly firm. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, sauté the onions in the vegetable oil over medium heat for 30 minutes, or until thoroughly caramelized. When the lentils are al dente, drain the liquid into a measuring cup and add enough water to bring the total amount of liquid to 1½ cups. Return to the saucepan and add the rice, salt, and a third of the onions. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the butter to the rice and continue simmering for 10 more minutes. Before serving, top the mujedrah with the remaining fried onions and their cooking oil.
