Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Set aside. Pour the olive oil into a shallow baking pan. Remove the leaves from the rosemary and scatter over the oil. Spread the sweet potatoes on the baking pan. With a spatula, turn the potatoes so they are coated with oil on both sides. Sprinkle potatoes with sea salt and pepper. Bake about 10 minutes. With spatula, turn potatoes and bake about 5 minutes longer or until potatoes are crisp-tender. Serve immediately.
