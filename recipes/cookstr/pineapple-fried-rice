Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise and remove the fruit from the middle. Cut out the eyes and core. Set the pineapple shell aside. Dice the pineapple fruit. Dry the diced pineapple with paper towels. In a medium bowl, add ½ teaspoon salt and the pepper to the eggs. To cook the chicken breasts, in a medium saucepan, bring 3 cups water to a boil and cook the chicken for about 15 minutes. Cut the cooked chicken into ½-inch diced pieces. Heat a wok until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and tilt the wok to coat the sides. Add the eggs. Cook and stir until the eggs are thickened throughout but still moist. Remove the eggs from the wok and set aside. Wash and thoroughly dry the wok. Make sure all the ingredients are dry before cooking. Reheat the wok until very hot. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and tilt to coat the sides of the wok. Add the rice and stir-fry for 2 minutes. If you cannot stir-fry fast enough, reduce the heat so the rice will not burn. Stir in the soy sauce and continue stirring until the rice is mixed well with the soy sauce. Stir in the shrimp, chicken, eggs, mushrooms, peas, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until the entire mixture is hot. Stir in the pineapple and green onions. Rinse the pineapple shell with boiling water; dry with paper towels. Place the pineapple rice into the pineapple shell and serve.
