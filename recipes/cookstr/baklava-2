Place the pistachios and the walnuts in a food processor and pulse until they are completely mixed. Add 2 tablespoons of the honey and mix until fully incorporated. Using a mandolin slicer or knife, cut the pears into 16 to 20 very thin disks. To assemble, place one slice of pear on a plate and top it with a spoonful of the pistachio mixture. Spread the mixture evenly, then place another slice of pear on top. Continue alternating layers until 4 slices of pear have been used. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of honey over the assembled baklava and serve.
