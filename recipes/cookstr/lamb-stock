Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Spread the bones in a large roasting pan and toss with a little olive oil to coat. Roast until evenly browned, 45-60 minutes, turning them over halfway. Heat the oil in a large stockpot and add the vegetables and garlic. Cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Add the tomato paste and fry for 2 minutes longer. Add the wine and let it boil until reduced by half. Add the browned bones to the pot. Pour in water to cover, about 8 cups. Bring to a simmer, skimming off the froth and scum that rise to the surface. Add the peppercorns and herbs. Simmer the stock for 4-6 hours until you are happy with the flavor. Take the pot off the heat and let stand for a few minutes before straining through a fine sieve. Let cool, then refrigerate, or freeze in convenient portions. Use fresh stock within 5 days or keep frozen for up to 3 months.
