While the tomatillos are cooling, soak the chiles: Put them in a bowl and pour over enough cold water to cover them completely. Soak until pliable but not completely softened, about 20 minutes. Drain. Combine the drained chiles, garlic, and one-third of the cooled tomatillos in a blender jar and blend until smooth. Add the remaining tomatillos and blend, using quick on/off pulses, just until smooth; donâ€™t overblend. Pour into a bowl and season with salt. The salsa can be kept at room temperature for up to 4 hours or refrigerated for up to 12 hours before serving. Before roasting, remove the husks and wash thhe tomatillos thorougly to remove all traces of stickiness. Leave the cores intact.
