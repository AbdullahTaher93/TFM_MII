Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Make sauce: Mix cucumber, yogurt, fromage blanc, raisins, and mint in a small bowl. Set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 9-inch (22.5-cm) ovenproof skillet. Add herbs, lettuce, and onions. Stir occasionally and cook 5 minutes to soften. Transfer to plate to cool. Mix herbs and eggs in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in skillet over medium heat. Pour egg mixture into hot oil, reduce heat to medium-Low, and cook, undisturbed, for 2 minutes or until bottom is firm and brown. Transfer skillet to oven. Bake about 5 minutes, just until top is firm. Cut into wedges and serve with cucumber sauce. Invert cooked eggs onto a plate to display the browned side when served.
