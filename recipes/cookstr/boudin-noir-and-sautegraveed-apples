Cut each apple slice in half crosswise. Melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the apples and brown sugar. Cook, stirring often, for 8â€“10 minutes, until the apples are softened and slightly caramelized. Transfer to a plate and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan. Add the oil and heat over medium-high heat. In batches, add the boudin noir and cook, turning once, for about 6 minutes, until slightly crisp. Transfer to the plate. Add the bacon to the frying pan and cook, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes, or until cooked through and slightly crisp. Transfer to the plate. Add the cider to the pan and increase the heat to high. Boil until reduced and syrupy, stirring up the browned bits in the pan with a wooden spoon. To serve, place a slice of boudin noir on each of 4 plates. Add a layer of apples, then repeat with the remaining boudin noir and apples. Top with the bacon strips and drizzle with the pan juices. Variation Boudin Blanc with Apple Substitute boudin blanc (white sausage with chicken and veal) for the boudin noir, and add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to the cooked apples.
