Heat the stock in a pan over a moderate heat. Heat the olive oil in a separate pan. Add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 5 minutes until softened. Add the rice to the pan and turn up the heat. Cook for a minute or so, stirring constantly, until the rice looks slightly translucent. Add the wine and keep stirring. Once the wine has been absorbed by the rice, add a ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn’t cook too quickly on the outside. Add the stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next, until the rice is cooked but still holds its shape – this takes about 15 minutes. Stir in the Appenzeller or Gruyere and Taleggio. Remove the pan from the heat and season to taste, then beat in the butter and Parmesan. Place a lid on the pan and leave to rest for 2 to 3 minutes – your risotto will get nice and oozy. Enjoy!
