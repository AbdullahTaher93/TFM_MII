TO PREPARE THE CARROTS Place the carrots in a medium saucepan and add enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat; then reduce to a simmer and cook the carrots until tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. Purée the carrots in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Add the lemon juice, process to combine, and then transfer to a small bowl. (The carrots can be made up to 2 days in advance. Cover and refrigerate; then bring to room temperature before making the pudding.) Preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat a 2-quart soufflé dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter, the sugar, flour, salt, pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Beat until smooth. Add the onion and puréed carrots, and beat until well blended. Add the milk and eggs, and mix until smooth. Spoon the mixture into the prepared dish. Bake, uncovered, until the pudding is puffed and lightly browned and the center is firm to the touch, about 50 minutes to 1 hour. Serve immediately. (The pudding can be assembled several hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate; then remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before baking.)
