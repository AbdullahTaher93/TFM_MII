Heat the oil in a saut√© pan. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, spices, and bay leaf, and cook over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until soft but not brown. Add the clam broth and bring to a boil. Stir in the spinach and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the spinach is soft and mushy. If the mixture dries out too much, add more clam broth. Stir in the shrimp and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, or until cooked. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish, garnish with the cilantro, and serve at once.
