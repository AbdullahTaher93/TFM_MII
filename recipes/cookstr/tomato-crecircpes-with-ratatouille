GARNISH Prepare the crêpes. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and sauté the shallots, eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and tomatoes for 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, basil and parsley, tomato juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer until the vegetables are soft, about 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly and mix in the cheese. Spoon ½ cup of the filling in a ribbon down the center of each crêpe and roll to enclose. Arrange in a greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Bake in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until heated through. Garnish with crème fraîche or yogurt and basil leaves. Serve at once.
