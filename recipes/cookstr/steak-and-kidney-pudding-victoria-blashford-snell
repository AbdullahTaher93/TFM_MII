Freezing Information: Freeze for up to 3 months. To make the pastry, sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Stir in the suet. Make a well in the center. Stir in just enough ice water to mix to a soft, but not sticky, dough. Shape into a thick disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate. To make the filling, trim the excess fat from the steak. Cut the meat and kidney into bite-sized pieces. Season the flour with salt and pepper then toss the steak and kidney pieces in the flour to coat evenly. Mix with the onion and mushrooms. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry. Line a 6-cup ovenproof bowl with the pastry, letting the excess hang over the side. Add the meat mixture, packing it snugly in the bowl, taking care not to tear the pastry. Sprinkle in the Worcestershire sauce, and add just enough stock to cover three-quarters of the filling. Roll out the remaining pastry to make a lid. Brush the overhanging edge of the pastry with cold water. Place the lid on top, and press the two layers of pastry together to seal. Flute the edges. Cut a circle of parchment paper larger than the top of the bowl. Pleat the top, to create surplus paper that will allow the pudding to expand. Secure on top of the bowl. Cover this with a double layer of pleated aluminum foil. Firmly crimp the foil around the rim of the bowl to secure it, or tie with kitchen string. Place the bowl on a steamer rack in a large stockpot. Add boiling water to almost reach the bottom of the bowl. Cook at a brisk simmer, adding more boiling water as needed as the water evaporates, for 4 hours, or until the crust is firm. To serve, remove the foil and paper. Run a knife around the edge of the pudding to loosen, then turn out on to a serving plate.
