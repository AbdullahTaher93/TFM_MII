Spear the chorizo slices vertically onto 4â€“6-inch wooden skewers, as if it they were lollipops, one slice of chorizo per stick. To make the candied sugar, stir the sugar and water in a heavy small saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Raise the heat and boil without stirring until the mixture turns light amber, occasionally brushing down pan sides with a wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and, holding the chorizo by the skewer, quickly dip it in the sugar and spear into the bread at an angle, being careful not to drip the hot sugar on your hands. Cool, snap off any sugar drippings, and present the chorizo on a tray, speared into the bread.
