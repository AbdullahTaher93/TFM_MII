Combine the tomatoes, watercress, tofu, and 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds in a large mixing bowl. Add the Miso Dressing, tossing thoroughly to coat. Taste and add a bit more dressing if desired. Distribute the salad evenly among six small plates and sprinkle each with the remaining black sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
