Rinse and dry the shrimp and put them in a bowl. Add the pomegranate molasses and mix gently. Set the shrimp on a cutting board or other flat surface and sprinkle on some pepper, cinnamon, cayenne, and half the rice flakes. Turn them over and season the other side the same way. Melt the butter with the oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat and gently set the shrimp in. When theyâ€™re nicely browned, after about 2 minutes, flip them over and cook the other side for another minute or so, depending on the size of the shrimp, until well browned. Place the cilantro on a plate and mound the shrimp over it. Liberally sprinkle them with salt and serve hot with additional pomegranate molasses if you like.
