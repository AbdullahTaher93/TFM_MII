Heat the olive oil in a large wide saucepan; add the ground beef, onion, and garlic. Sauté, stirring, over medium heat until the meat is browned, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce and paste, basil, and oregano. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-low heat until sauce is cooked down and thickened, 1½ to 2 hours. (There should be about 4 cups sauce.) Season with salt and pepper. Cook the lasagne noodles in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, or firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Let noodles sit in a bowl of cool water until ready to use. Beat the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and egg together; set aside. Heat the oven to 350°F. Select a 9 × 13-inch shallow baking dish. Add about ½ cup of the tomato sauce to the bottom of the dish. Lift the noodles from the water individually and blot dry on paper toweling. Arrange a slightly overlapping layer of 5 noodles on the bottom of the dish. Dot the noodles with half the ricotta mixture; add about a third of the remaining sauce and arrange a layer of a third of the mozzarella slices on top. Arrange a second layer of 5 slightly overlapping lasagne noodles. Dot with the remaining ricotta, half of the remaining tomato sauce, and half of the remaining mozzarella. Top with the 5 remaining lasagne noodles in a slightly overlapping layer; add the remaining sauce and a layer of the remaining mozzarella. Bake until cheese is melted and mixture is bubbly, about 50 minutes. Let stand at least 15 minutes before serving.
