Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook the onions, stirring, until golden and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic turns golden, about 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to turn brown and soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the water and peas. Cover and cook over medium heat for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the salt, pepper, and allspice and mix well. Cook for an additional 2 minutes. Serve hot in a medium-size bowl or over the rice.
