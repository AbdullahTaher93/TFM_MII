In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, vanilla bean, and coconut milk. Simmer over moderate heat until the sugar dissolves. Add the shredded coconut and cook for 7 to 8 minutes to extract the flavors. Pour in the milk, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring often, for about 20 minutes, until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and add the corn kernels. Whisk in the egg yolks. Turn the cocada into a bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours. Before serving, beat the egg whites until stiff and glossy. Fold the whites into the custard mixture. Turn into a serving dish and sprinkle with the toasted coconut.
