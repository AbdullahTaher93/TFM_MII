. Put the peanuts, palm sugar, honey, butter, and salt into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the peanuts are finely chopped and the mixture is starting to come together, about 20 times. (You can also do this by hand: Pound all the ingredients together in a large mortar with a pestle or chop the peanuts and mix with the other ingredients.) Form the mixture into ½-inch balls and place on a baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard, about 5 minutes. Put a peanut ball in the center of a puff pastry round. Fold the circle over the filling to form a half-moon and press the edges with the tines of a fork to seal. Repeat with the remaining peanut balls and puff pastry rounds. Fill a medium saucepan with oil to a depth of 2 inches and heat to 350°F When the oil is ready (a pinch of flout will sizzle), add a few of the turnovers, without crowding the pan, and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining turnovers. Serve warm or at room temperature.
