Prepare ahead The purèe can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. Combine the apricots and orange juice in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Lower the heat and cover. Simmer for 25–30 minutes, or until very tender. Cool slightly. Transfer the apricot mixture to a food processor and purèe. If the mixture is too thick, add a little more orange juice. 3. Serve warm or cold, in individual serving dishes with layered Greek yogurt, muesli, and pistachio slivers. Variation Variation Peach Parfait: Instead of apricots, use 12oz (350g) dried peaches. The parfait also makes a delicious sauce for ice cream, thinned with a little juice or a liqueur, such as apricot brandy or Amaretto.
