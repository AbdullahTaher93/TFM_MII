Toss the cherries with the kirsch and 2 tbsp of the sugar in a bowl and let stand for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and butter a ceramic or glass 10in (25cm) one-piece quiche or flan dish and set aside. Strain the liquid from the cherries. Whisk the eggs, drained cherry liquid, seeds from the vanilla bean, and the remaining 4 tbsp sugar in a bowl until combined. Gradually whisk in the flour, then add the milk and salt, and whisk until smooth. Spread the cherries in the dish, then pour in the batter. Bake for 35–45 minutes, until the top is browned and the center is firm to the touch. Serve warm or at room temperature. Variation Plum Clafoutis Substitute small pitted plums for the cherries and add more sugar to compensate for the tartness of the plums.
