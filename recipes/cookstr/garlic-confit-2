Slice off the brown root end of each clove and place the cloves in a saucepan. Cover them completely with the oil. Heat the oil very, very gentlyâ€”you want bubbles to rise but not break the surface. Slow and gentle is the key here. Cook for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and let the cloves cool in the pan. Then transfer to a lidded jar and refrigerate. The confit will last in the refrigerator, sealed and in oil, for a few months, but you will go through it quickly once you taste how good it is and start using it regularly.
