Arrange chicken in a large pot. Add stock, and cook until tender but not falling apart, 1 to 1Â½ hours. Lift chicken out of stock and cool slightly. Reserve stock. Process tortillas, raisins, chocolate, almonds, onion, bell pepper, tomato, and garlic in a food processor or blender until finely ground. Add enough stock to make a thick gravy-like sauce. Add crushed chile and cinnamon. Pour sauce into a large pot. Add chicken pieces and simmer 30 minutes. If mixture becomes too dry, add more stock. Serve hot with rice.
