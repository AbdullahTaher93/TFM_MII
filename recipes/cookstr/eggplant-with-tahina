Grill the eggplant over a gas grill until the skin is completely charred or prick and place on a cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 450Â°F oven for 20 minutes or until soft inside. Cool. Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise, drain off the liquid, and scoop out the pulp. Press the pulp through a food mill or pulse in a food processor equipped with a steel blade. Stir in the parsley, tahina, lemon juice, and garlic. For a thinner baba ghanouj that is whiter in color, add a little water. Season with salt and cayenne pepper to taste and garnish with additional chopped parsley.
