Place the raisins in a small bowl, cover with very hot water, and set aside for at least 30 minutes to plump, replacing the hot water once or twice. Tear all the cabbage into large pieces. Heat the oven to 400Â°F. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat until it slides easily across the pan. Add the leek, carrot, parsnips, turnip, salt, and pepper, Cook, stirring often, until the leek begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add a little cabbage, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring. When the cabbage begins to soften add more, continuing until all the cabbage has been added. Add the butter, thyme, and a little more salt and pepper. Cook, turning the vegetables in the melting butter, until all the cabbage has wilted, about 3 minutes more. Drain the raisins and stir them into the cabbage mixture. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until the cabbage is tender, about 40 minutes. Serve immediately.
