1 Preheat the oven and a nonstick baking tray to 425°F. 2 Lightly brush the sheets of phyllo dough with a little of the olive oil and fold them in half. Stack them, one on top of the other, on another nonstick baking tray (one which would fit inside the other baking tray). 3 In a frying pan, warm the rest of the oil over medium heat. Add the ground coriander, fennel seeds, scallions, cumin seeds, and garlic, and stir-fry until the spices start releasing their fragrant bouquet. Add the chili powder and the tomatoes (you will need to do this in two batches), and cook for 1-2 minutes, being careful not to break up the tomato slices. Set aside any cooking juices. 4 Arrange the tomatoes on the dough, leaving a ¼-inch edge around the dough. Set the baking tray on top of the hot tray in the oven and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and golden. 5 Drizzle any tomato spice juices over the tart and serve.
