Dry the shrimp well and sprinkle salt on both sides. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Heat the oil in four ramekins or one shallow 8-inch casserole, preferably earthenware. Add the garlic and chile pepper, and when the garlic starts to turn golden (be careful not to overcook) add the shrimp. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, for about 2 minutes, or until the shrimp are just done. Sprinkle in the paprika, parsley, and salt. Serve immediately, right in the cooking dish if possible. Provide lots of good bread for dunking.
