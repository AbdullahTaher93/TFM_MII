Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat with a fork until lemon colored. Stir in the bread crumbs and tomato sauce. Cut the onion half in half. Place the onion halves, garlic, and parsley in a food processor. Pulse several times until finely chopped. Add the onion mixture to the bread crumb mixture along with the Italian seasoning and stir to combine. Add the ground round to the bread crumb mixture and mash it with a fork to combine. Divide the ground round mixture into 6 even portions and form these into loaves Place the meat loaves in a 13-by-9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Bake until the tops brown and the meat loaves have cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the meat loaves from the oven, serve at once, or let cool, wrap in aluminum foil, and freeze for a later meal. The meat loaves will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months. 2.
