Trim the stem ends off the Brussels sprouts, and remove any tough outer leaves. Halve the sprouts lengthwise, and then cut them into julienne strips. Heat the oil and butter together in a heavy pot. Add the bacon and cook over medium-low heat until it renders its fat and turns golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the carrots and cook, stirring constantly, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the sprouts to the pot, toss well, and cook, stirring, until they are crisp-tender, 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the chives and serve immediately.
