While the ceviche is curing, make the sauce: Cut away the flesh from both flat sides of the mango pit, then trim as much of the flesh from the narrow sides of the pit as possible. Use a large spoon to separate the flesh from the skin of the 2 large pieces of mango. Slice the skin from the smaller pieces. Put the smaller pieces in a blender. Coarsely chop a little less than half of the remaining mango and add that to the blender. Add the orange juice, cider vinegar, garlic, chile de àrbol, and habanero and blend until smooth. Pour the sauce into a mixing bowl. Add the water to the blender jar, swish to rinse it, and add to the bowl. Cut the remaining mango into ¼-inch dice and set aside. Drain the ceviche and put it in a mixing bowl; discard the marinade. Pour the mango sauce over the ceviche. Add the jicama, scallion, red onion, cilantro, mint, lime juice, and reserved mango. Stir well, then add salt to taste and more lime juice if necessary. Let sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. Spoon into large cocktail glasses, stick a strip or two of scallion green into each portion, if desired, and serve.
