To prepare the crepes: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the milk, salt, sugar, melted butter, and oil. Set aside. In another medium mixing bowl, add the flour and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and beat until incorporated. The batter will be quite thick and stiff. Slowly stir in the milk mixture, incorporating fully before adding more. Whisk in the beer and vanilla seeds. Set aside to thicken, 30 minutes to 1 hour. To prepare the apples: While the batter is thickening, make the apples. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large, shallow baking dish, combine the apples, sugar, cinnamon, and salt, tossing until the apples are evenly coated. Spread out the apples in single layer, being sure not to crowd or overlap them. Bake for 10 minutes, until the apples are starting to soften, then remove the pan from the oven and stir well, turning the apples. Return the pan to the oven and bake until the apples are browning, about 5 minutes more. Now add the cider to the pan and stir to combine. Bake until the cider turns syrupy, about 5 minutes more. Remove the pan from the oven and set aside until you're ready to use it. After the batter has sat (at least 30 mintues), set a small frying pan over medium-high heat until it's very hot A drop of water splashed in the pan should sizzle and evaporate upon touch. Add a small spoon of butter (about Â½ teaspoon) to the pan and wipe out the excess with a paper towel, working to coat all sides of the pan. Ladle a small amount of batter into the pan, about 1/8 cup. Lift the pan slightly, swirling to evenly coat it with a very thin layer of batter. When the crepe is lightly browned, use an offset spatula or small kitchen spatula to flip it over. Cook the second side until it's lightly brown, about 1 minute. Continue working in this fashion until ail the crepes are cooked, stacking them on a plate. To serve, fold 2 or 3 crepes into quarters and fan them out on a plate. Spoon over a portion of the apples and serve immediately.
