In a saucepan, bring 1 cup of the water to a boil and simmer the berries for 5 minutes to help release their juice. If you wish, remove the seeds by pouring the berries and liquid into a strainer. Return the juice to the saucepan and bring it to a simmering boil. Add the remaining cup of water and the lemon zest, and stir in the sugar until dissolved. Allow this syrup to cool, stir in the liqueur, and place it in a covered container in the freezer. After an hour or so, stir the partially frozen granita to minimize separation, then freeze it solid. (You may have to turn down the thermostat of your freezer to do so.) Prepare the granita for serving by vigorously going over it with a fork to create a light, fluffy texture. If the block is frozen so hard that you have difficulty fluffing it up, allow it to stand out to soften somewhat.
