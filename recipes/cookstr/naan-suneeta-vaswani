In a food processor, pulse together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add 2½ tbsp (32 mL) of the ghee and egg and pulse again. With processor running, gradually pour in milk through feed tube and process until dough comes together. Process for 1 minute more. Knead bread for 1 minute. Dough should be very soft and smooth. Form into a ball, cover with a towel and set aside for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Knead dough for 2 minutes. Divide into 5 portions and roll into balls. Cover with a towel. Working with one ball at a time, pat dough into a disk and roll into an oval, about 8 by 4 inches (20 by 10 cm). Gently pull one end to make into a teardrop shape. Transfer to baking sheet. Make remaining naans and place on baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes. Flip and cook other side until cooked through, for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and brush generously with remaining ghee. Serve immediately.
