Stir in the parsley, basil, capers, and rosemary and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside until ready to use Whisk before using. To make the fish: Lay the swordfish between 2 sheets of plastic wrap Using a meat mallet or the bottom of a small, heavy skillet, lightly pound the fish until it is about ¼ inch thick. Transfer the fish to a plate, season with salt and black pepper. Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Saute the onion and garlic for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove pan from the heat and stir in the parsley, thyme, capers, and red pepper. Season with salt and black pepper and set aside. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the fish. Cover with the provolone and roll each piece of fish into a roll. Hold the rolls closed with toothpicks. In an ovenproof sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat and saute the swordfish rolls until golden brown on all sides. Turn them carefully with tongs or a wooden spoon. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 4 to 6 minutes, just until they are still moist in the center. Do not overcook. Put each swordfish roll on a plate. Whisk the vinaigrette and spoon a little over each roll. Garnish with any remaining bread crumbs.
