In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat, until shimmering. Saut√© the celery, carrots, shallots, and apple until transparent, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often. Add the curry powder and cook 1 minute. Add the stock, bring to a boil, and lower the heat to medium. Simmer for 4 minutes then add the cream coconut milk and optional cilantro or coriander seed. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes. The sauce will thicken and reduce slightly. Strain through a fine strainer, pushing down on the solids. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Variations: For fish and shellfish dishes, make the sauce with lobster stock or shrimp stock. For cilantro, substitute the bulbous white portion of 1 stalk lemongrass, cut into 1-inch pieces. For a slightly richer and thicker sauce, omit the coconut milk and use all heavy cream.
