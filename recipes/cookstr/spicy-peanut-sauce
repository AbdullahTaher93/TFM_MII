Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil, and when hot, add the shallots, garlic, and ginger and saut√© until the shallots are soft and transparent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth, raise the heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and stir in the remaining ingredients. Simmer the sauce, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes until thickened. Serve the sambal warm or at room temperature. Do not refrigerate, or the peanut butter will congeal and the flavors will not blend.
