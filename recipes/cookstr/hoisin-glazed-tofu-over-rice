Cut the tofu into Â½-inch-wide slices and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the hoisin, tamari, and water. Set aside. Heat the safflower oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the tofu, ginger, scallions, and red pepper flakes and stir-fry for 3 minutes, or until fragrant. Add the hoisin mixture and bring to a simmer, stirring until heated through, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, heat both rices together with the sesame oil, tossing to coat. Serve the tofu over the rice.
