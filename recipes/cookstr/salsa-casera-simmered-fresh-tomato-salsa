In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the water, 2 teaspoons of the salt, and the tomatillos, tomatoes, onion, clove, garlic, and chiles. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook gently for about 10 minutes, until the tomatillos are just softened. Be careful not to boil vigorously, or the ingredients may fall apart. With a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to a food processor, draining well. Discard the cooking liquid. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and pulse the salsa until it is very smooth, with specks of chile de arbol. Cool completely. Stir in the cilantro, then taste and adjust the seasoning as desired.
