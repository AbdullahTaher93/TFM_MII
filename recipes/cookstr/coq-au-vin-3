Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large, heavy skillet and brown the chicken over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes on each side. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drain off the butter, pour the Cognac over the chicken, and flambé. Add enough wine to just cover the chicken, then add the bouquet garni. Cover the pan and simmer for 30 minutes, or until tender. Test the pieces of white meat first, and if done, transfer to a warm platter while the dark meat continues to cook. Remove the bouquet garni. Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in another skillet and brown the onions and salt pork. Then cover and cook very slowly for about 20 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Add the mushrooms and cook for another 4 minutes. When the chicken has been removed from the pan, degrease the sauce and bring to a boil. Add the beurre manié a bit at a time until the sauce has thickened slightly. Correct the seasoning. Add the onions, salt pork, and mushrooms to the chicken, and pour the sauce over all.
