Place the potatoes in a pot with water to cover and boil for about 6 to 7 minutes (the potatoes should be parboiled but not completely cooked through). Cool the potatoes, peel them, and cut into wedges and set aside. Heat the mustard oil in a wok or skillet on medium heat for about 1 minute and add the panch phoron and wait till it crackles. Add the onion and sauté lightly for about 3 to 4 minutes, till the onion is soft and translucent. Add the green chilies and cumin-coriander powder. Add the salt and the potato wedges and mix well. Cook, stirring well, till the potatoes are coated with the spices and begin to turn golden. Add the sugar, poppy seed paste, and ½ cup water and cook till the mixture is fairly dry (the moisture should dry out leaving a soft coating of the poppy seed paste over the potatoes).
