In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Make a well in the center. Add the lard and 2 cups (480 ml) of the water. Stir well with a spatula, until the dough starts coming together. Switch to your hands and add the remaining 1?2 cup (120 ml) water, kneading until the dough comes together (it will be soft and sticky). Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead it for 1 to 2 minutes (adding more flour as needed), until the dough holds together in a ball and no longer sticks to your fingers. Return the dough to the bowl; cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.
