Wash and cut everything as suggested. Heat the olive oil and half the butter in a heavy saucepan; add the scallions, spinach, herbs, and salt to taste and cook over medium heat for a few minutes, stirring frequently. Add the rice and cook several more minutes, until the grains of rice begin to turn clear and golden. Add the water, bring it to a boil, turn the heat to low, cover the pan, and cook until the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Add the remaining butter and lightly stir it into the rice with a fork. Turn the rice into a serving dish, grind pepper over the surface, and dust with a grating of cheese.
