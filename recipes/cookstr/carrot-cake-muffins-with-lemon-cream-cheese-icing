Position your oven racks so that one is in the center, and preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Smear six big muffin tin cups with butter. Whisk the flours, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a medium-size bowl. In a separate, big bowl, whisk the eggs to break up the yolks. Still whisking with one hand, pour in the sugar with the other. Continue whisking for a few minutes, until the eggs begin to pale in color. Whisk in the oil and applesauce. Stir in the carrots and walnuts. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet, stirring gently with a wooden spoon until there’s not a trace of flour visible. This batter will be very runny. Scoop the batter up with a glass measuring cup or a ladle, and pour it evenly into the six cups of your prepared muffin tin. Wipe off any batter that may have spilled onto the pan. Place the muffin tin on the center rack in the oven, and bake the muffins for 35–40 minutes, until they begin to darken and a toothpick or small knife inserted deep into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Remove the tin from the oven, and place it on a wire rack. Let the muffins sit for a few minutes in the tin, until they’re cool enough to touch. To remove the muffins, flip the tin upside down and let the muffins fall out onto the wire rack to cool completely. Just before you’re ready to serve these, spread a nice thick layer of lemon–cream cheese icing on top with a rubber or offset spatula.
