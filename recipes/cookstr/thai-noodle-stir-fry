Soak the noodles in a bowl of very hot water about 10 minutes, until softened. Drain well and rinse under cold running water. Cut into manageable lengths with kitchen scissors. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a wok over high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry about 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tbsp oil. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, bell pepper, lemongrass, ginger, and chili, and stir-fry about 2 minutes, or until the bell pepper softens. Add the bok choy and stir-fry for about 2 minutes, or until wilted. Return the chicken to the pan and add the noodles. Pour in the soy sauce, fish sauce, and sweet chile sauce, and toss everything together over the heat for 2â€“3 minutes, or until piping hot. Serve hot.
