Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease a shallow baking dish. Set aside. Using a sharp knife, cut the butterfly pork chops in half. Using a smaller knife, make a pocket in the side of each piece. Set aside. In a medium bowl stir together Buttery Corn Bread pieces, apple, celery, onion, and chopped or dried sage. Add walnuts, raisins, salt, and pepper. Mix well. Stuff the mixture into the pockets of the pork chops. In a large skillet heat oil. Add pork chops and brown on both sides. Transfer to prepared baking dish. Top with apricots and sage leaves. Cover with foil and bake about 50 minutes or until chops are thoroughly cooked. Serve immediately.
