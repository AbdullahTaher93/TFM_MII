To make the grits, bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the salt, pepper, and butter and stir until tile butter melts. Add the grits in a slow, steady stream as you stir constantly with a whisk. Continue stirring until the grits return to a boil. Scrape into a 3- to 4-quart slow cooker. Cover the cooker and cook for 3 to 4 hours on high, or 5 to 6 hours on low, until creamy and thick.
