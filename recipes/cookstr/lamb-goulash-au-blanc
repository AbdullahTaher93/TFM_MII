Smear the bottom of the slow cooker with the butter and sprinkle with the onion. Put the lamb in the cooker, and arrange the lemon slices over it. In a mortar, mash together the caraway seeds, marjoram, and garlic with a pestle; stir into the broth. Add the broth to the cooker, cover, and cook on LOW until the lamb is fork-tender, 5 to 6 hours. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
