Put whole beets and water into a large pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 30 minutes. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft. Stir in tomato and cook a few more minutes. Add onion and tomato mix, potatoes, carrots, cabbage, bay leaf, salt, and pepper to soup pot, cover, and cook over low heat 1 hour. Remove cooked beets with a fork and rinse under cold water to cool. Peel and grate. Stir grated beets, dill, and parsley into soup; continue cooking 10 minutes to blend flavors. Serve garnished with sour cream or crème fraîche.
