To make the garam masala, grind all the ingredients in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle until fine. This can be prepared in advance. You will not need all of it for this recipe, but it keeps well in a sealed container for several months if all the ingredients are fresh when first prepared. Put the yogurt, cornstarch, and 2 heaping teaspoons garam masala in a shallow bowl and mix well. Place the duck breasts in the bowl and turn to cover completely in the marinade. Cover the bowl and leave in the fridge for 4 hours or overnight (the flavor will improve if left overnight). Remove the duck from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking. Heat a griddle to medium high or a grill to high. Remove most of the yogurt mixture from the duck and cook the breasts for about 8-10 minutes, turning over halfway through. Cook a little longer if you prefer your duck cooked through. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Place the yogurt mixture in a saucepan and gently bring to a boil. Cook briefly and add a dash of water if the mixture is too thick. Serve the duck with the warm yogurt dressing on top and a scattering of cilantro for color.
