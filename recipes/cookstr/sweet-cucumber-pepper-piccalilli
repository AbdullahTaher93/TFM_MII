Under a warm running tap, scrub the cucumbers well with a vegetable brush. Place the cucumbers, onion, and bell peppers in a large colander set over a bowl. Sprinkle 2½ teaspoons of the salt over the vegetables and toss to combine well. Let them stand for 3 hours, then discard any liquid in the bottom of the bowl. Transfer the vegetables to a clean dish towel (we prefer towels cut from thin cloth, such as a flour sack). Bundle the vegetables tightly and squeeze them as strongly as one can manage, until no more liquid can be extracted. In a small saucepan set over medium heat, stir together the vinegar and sugar until the sugar completely dissolves, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the vegetables, turmeric, black pepper, the remaining ½ teaspoon salt, and cinnamon stick; simmer until the liquid has evaporated and the relish is thick, 10 to 12 minutes. Fill the jar with the hot relish and seal, if desired (see Notes), or let cool to room temperature before chilling. Chilled, unprocessed relish will keep in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
