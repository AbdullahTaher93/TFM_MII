Heat the oil in the widest pan you own (or use a roasting pan straddling two burners) over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the chicken thighs skin sides down and cook them, flipping once or twice, until the skin is deeply browned, about 10 minutes. When the meat is browned, add the onions and cook them, stirring occasionally, until they soften and start to take on a little color, then add the garlic and bay leaf and cook 1 minute more, until the garlic is golden. Drain the soaked mushrooms and add them, along with the fresh mushrooms, to the pan; cook, stirring, until the mushrooms have wilted slightly and begun to give up some of their liquid. Add the chorizo and pimentón and cook, stirring, for a 30 seconds more. Add the wine and reduce by half, about 10–15 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the rice, scattering it across the pan in as even a layer as possible. Add the stock and saffron and season heavily with salt. When the stock reaches a boil, set a timer for 20 minutes, and adjust the heat so the paella cooks at a gentle simmer. When the timer rings, check the rice—if it’s still crunchy on the top, add a little more liquid and cook a few minutes longer. When the rice is ready, turn the heat off, let the paella rest for 2 minutes, and serve immediately. 2.
