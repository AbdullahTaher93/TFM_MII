In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup and peanut butter until melted together. Bring to a boil for a short time so the peanut butter mixes with the corn syrup. (If you cook too long it will reach a candy state and cookies will be difficult to bite into.) Remove from the heat and pour over 6 cups crispy rice cereal in a large bowl. Mix well. Spray a baking dish with cooking spray and press the cereal mixture evenly into the baking dish. Melt chocolate chips and butterscotch chips together in a double boiler. Spread the chocolate and butterscotch mixture over the cereal and refrigerate until top hardens. Remove from the refrigerator 10 minutes before cutting. Cut into squares when ready to serve. I prefer to serve these at room temperature once the top is hardened.
