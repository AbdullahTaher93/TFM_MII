In a bowl, moisten the fresh bread crumbs with the milk. Mix in 1 egg, sea salt, pepper, parsley, and cheese. Set aside. Place the fish in a shallow pan with the water, coarse salt, carrot, and onion; simmer until fish easily flakes, about 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully lift the fish out of the water with a strainer, place in a bowl, and cool to room temperature. Dice the carrot and add to the bread crumb mixture. Discard the water and onion. Flake the fish with a fork, then add it to the bread crumb mixture and mix well. Have ready a plate with the flour, and one with the fine bread crumbs. In a small bowl, beat the remaining eggs. Divide the fish mixture evenly into 8 balls, forming them with your hands. Roll each ball in the flour and shake off the excess. Coat the balls in the beaten egg, then roll them in the bread crumbs, coating them evenly. Place the balls on a plate and press down slightly with your hand to flatten a little. In a deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 375Â°F. Fry the fish cakes in the oil until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on brown paper and serve hot, accompanied by lemon wedges.
