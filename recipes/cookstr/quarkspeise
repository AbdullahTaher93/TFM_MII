Whisk the heavy cream and farmer's cheese together in a bowl. Add the confectioner's sugar and whisk until smooth. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold into the cheese mixture. Line a sieve with cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Spoon the cheese mixture into the sieve and spread evenly with the back of a spoon, making sure there are no air pockets. Fold the cheesecloth over the top. Refrigerate and drain overnight. Pur√©e the raspberries and confectioner's sugar together in a blender. Rub through a fine sieve to remove the seeds. Turn the cheese mixture out onto a serving platter and remove the cheesecloth. Serve with the raspberry sauce and berries.
