These little quail should be served on Polenta cakes, soaking the squares with their juices, while the are picked apart and eaten with the fingers. Prepare the charcoal fire. Salt and pepper the cavities for the birds. Place 2 juniper berries in each cavity. Truss the birds, brush with olive oil, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400Â° F. When the coals reach a dusty red glow, lightly oil the grill. Brown the birds on the grill, turning often. Place on a heatproof pan and baste with a little more oil. Bake in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes, until rare and juicy. Serve the quail on the fried Polenta cakes so that the polenta will absorb the juices.
