Cut the squash in half lengthwise and put it in a baking dish cut side down, adding a little water. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and microwave 8 to 10 minutes, or until the squash is tender. Turn the squash halves over and carefully pull out and discard the seedsâ€”some may be lurking in the strands. With a fork, scrape out the strands until you have about 3 cups. Toss the strands in a bowl with the remaining ingredients and serve immediately.
