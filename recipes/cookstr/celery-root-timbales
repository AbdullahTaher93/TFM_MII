Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the celery root and potatoes in a large saucepan and add enough lightly salted water to cover. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer about 10 minutes, or until tender; drain well. Purèe the celery root, potato, cream, eggs, yolk, garlic, and nutmeg together in a food processor. Season with salt and pepper. Butter six 6 oz (175ml) ramekins. Divide the celery root mixture among the ramekins. Place in a roasting pan and add hot water halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until just firm to the touch. Carefully run a knife around the inside of each ramekin and turn out onto plates.
