Preheat the oven to 325°F. with the rack in the center position. Place all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and with your hands or 2 large spoons mix them well. Spread the granola in a large, shallow baking pan; the layer should not be deeper than 1 inch. You may have to bake the granola in several batches. Bake for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the granola cool completely before storing it in a closed container. Preheat the oven to 325°F. with the rack in the center position.
