Preheat the oven to 325°F. Wash the duck and remove excess fat from the body and neck cavities. Rub the inside lightly with salt. Combine the onion, celery, sugar, cinnamon, anise seed, 1/3 cup of the soy sauce and 1 cup of the water. Bring to the boiling point. Tie the duck's neck tightly with a string so the sauce will not seep out while cooking. Pour the hot sauce inside the duck. Sew up the vent tightly. Rub the outside of the duck with a little salt. Place breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast for 20 minutes. Heat 1 cup water with the honey, vinegar, remaining soy sauce and 1 tablespoon salt. Brush this mixture over the skin of the bird. Continue to cook until the duck is done, about 1½ hours, basting at 20-minute intervals with this sauce. Remove the duck from the oven. Drain the sauce into a saucepan and thicken it with cornstarch mixed with 2 teaspoons water. Cook until slightly thickened. Serve separately as gravy.
