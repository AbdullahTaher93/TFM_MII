Butterfly each chicken breast (or have the butcher do it for you), place between sheets of parchment or waxed paper, and with a meat mallet or the back of a small, heavy iron skillet, gently pound until about ¼ inch thick. Place a sage leaf and 2 overlapping slices of prosciutto on each chicken breast and fold over to form a sandwich, with the prosciutto on the outside. Pound gently again to an even thickness and secure with toothpicks if needed. In a heavy skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with the olive oil over medium-high heat. Dredge the chicken breasts in seasoned flour and add to the pan. Cook until beautifully browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Set aside and keep warm. Add the mushrooms to the pan with a bit more olive oil if necessary and sauté until they are lightly browned and the juices have evaporated. Set aside and keep warm. Add the Marsala and stock to the pan, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to a boil and reduce by half or until the sauce has thickened lightly. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place the chicken breasts on warm plates and top with oyster mushrooms. Spoon the sauce over and garnish with fried sage leaves, if using. Serve immediately.
