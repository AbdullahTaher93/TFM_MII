Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast for about 8 minutes, until fragrant and golden. Set aside to cool. Turn off the oven. In a large bowl, stir together ¼ cup of the olive oil, the 3 tablespoons garlic, the 2 tablespoons pimenton, 1 tablespoon salt, the cumin, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Poke the skinless side of the chicken all over with a fork or paring knife. Coat the chicken with the spice mixture, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator, allowing it to sit out for 15 to 30 minutes as you preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the chicken in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 50 minutes. (Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the pieces.) You should see the meat pulling away from the bone, with about an inch of bone visible at the drumstick. The skin should be crispy and golden brown. Transfer the chicken to a warm serving platter. While the chicken cooks, make the sauce. Purée the remaining 2 teaspoons garlic, 1 teaspoon pimentón, the piquillo peppers, almonds, lemon juice, and crackers in a blender or food processor until nearly smooth. With the motor running, drizzle in the remaining 1 cup of oil until the mixture is well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Because this is a bistro dish, I like to serve it family style on a large platter. Spoon some of the pepper sauce over the chicken pieces and serve the rest in a bowl on the side. Garnish the chicken with chopped cilantro, if desired. Roasted new potatoes tossed with olive oil and sea salt make a great accompaniment.
