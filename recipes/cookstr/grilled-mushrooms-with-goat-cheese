Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). To make the dressing, whisk together all the ingredients and set aside. Cut the bread diagonally into ¼ in (6mm) slices. Brush both sides with olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown. Remove the stems from the mushrooms. Slice the goat cheese into rounds. Place a slice in each mushroom cap. Position the broiler rack about 6in (15cm) from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Place the mushrooms on the broiler rack. Drizzle with a little olive oil and the balsamic vinegar, then season with salt and pepper. Grill for about 5 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling and the mushrooms are tender. To serve, top each toast with a mushroom, and drizzle with the dressing. Variation Blue Cheese Mushrooms: Use a mild blue cheese, such as Roquefort or gorgonzola, instead of goat cheese. Omit the olives from the dressing.
