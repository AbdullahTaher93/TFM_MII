In a small bowl, stir together the tamari, water, sugar, salt, sesame oil, and cornstarch. Set aside. In a large skillet or wok, heat the safflower oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the broccoli and stir-fry for 1 minute, or until bright green. With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Add the garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and tofu to the pan and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Return the broccoli to the pan and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the tamari mixture and the scallions and stir-fry for 1 minute, or until the broccoli is tender and well coated with the sauce. Serve over the rice.
