In a large stockpot, combine the meat, garlic, salt, and 4 quarts water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the meat is tender or until the internal temperature registers 175°F on a meat thermometer, about 2 hours. Remove the meat and allow it to cool. Skim the fat from the broth. Shred the meat and place it in a large shallow baking dish. Add a ladle or two of the broth to keep the pork moist. Cover with aluminum foil and set aside. (The recipe can be prepared ahead up to this point.) Preheat the oven to 250°F. Place the pork in the oven to warm. Meanwhile, bring the broth to a boil again. Add the drained hominy and simmer for 20 minutes. To serve, divide the pork and hominy among 6 to 8 large soup bowls. Add enough of the broth to fill the bowl halfway. Pass the garnishes at the table.
