Heat the oil in a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker. Stir in the onions, cumin seeds, 2 tablespoons of the chili powder, and the cinnamon and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Stir in the beer. Taste the mixture, and if the chili flavor is not pronounced, add more chili powder to taste. Stir in the turkey sausage, turkey, bell pepper, beans, and chickpeas. Break up any large pieces of sausage. Pour the tomatoes and their liquid on top. Do not stir after adding the tomatoes. Lock the lid in place. Over high heat bring to high pressure. Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 4 minutes. Turn off the heat. Quick-release the pressure. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow steam to escape. Add the cilantro plus salt and pepper to taste. Serve in bowls with a generous sprinkling of the pumpkin seeds and cilantro on top.
