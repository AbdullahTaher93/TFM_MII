Make an ice-water bath (see Notes). Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil, Core the tomatoes and cut an X in the bottom of each with the tip of a knife. Blanch the tomatoes in the boiling water for about 10 seconds, then remove the tomatoes from the water with tongs and place in the bowl of ice water. Drain the tomatoes, then peel and cut them into quarters. Remove the seeds and ribs with a sharp knife and discard. Each tomato will yield lour “petals” of flesh. Cut each petal into thin strips and then into a small dice and place in a medium bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the oil, the salt, pepper, vinegar, olives, and thyme. Toss gently. Preheat the broiler, or prepare the grill. If you are using the roasted garlic, mash the garlic with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Brush the baguette slices with the oil, lightly season with salt and pepper, and place the slices on a baking sheet if using the broiler. Toast the slices until golden brown, then set aside to cool. Spoon 2 teaspoons of the tomato-olive mixture onto each bread slice and arrange on a festive platter to serve.
