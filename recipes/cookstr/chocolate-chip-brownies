In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, thoroughly combine the shortening, granulated sugar, tofu, and vanilla. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt with a wire whisk. Add the flour mixture to the shortening mixture, and mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips with a rubber spatula. Preheat oven to 350°F, and spray an 8-inch square baking dish with dairy-free baking spray. Spread the batter into the prepared baking pan, and bake for 30 minutes, or until an inserted cake tester comes out clean. Cool completely, and dust with confectioners’ sugar.
