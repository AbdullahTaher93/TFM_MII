To make the topping, place the avocados and cucumber in a medium bowl. Add the cilantro, lemon juice, and sea salt, and mix well. Let marinate for about 5 minutes while you prepare the rest of the soup. Place all the soup ingredients in a food processor. Process until smooth, adding water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time until the desired consistency is reached. Ladle the soup into bowls, skimming off any foam that may have formed at the top. Scoop a heaping spoonful of topping onto each portion and serve.
