Preheat the oven to 375°F. With heavy kitchen shears, cut out the backbone of each bird, then cut them in half above the breastbone. Cut away as much fat as possible, then rinse and pat dry. In a small bowl combine the lemon peel, garlic powder, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle the spice mixture over the birds and rub it in well. Core, seed, and cut the peppers into very thin strips. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the peppers, cover the skillet, and cook until they’re tender, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice, unpeeled garlic, and raisins. Simmer covered for 10 minutes more. Set the birds, skin side up, on top of the peppers and place the skillet in the oven. Bake until the juices run clear, not rosy, when the thigh is pricked with a fork, about 1 hour. Let sit for 5 minutes, then transfer the hens to dinner plates and spoon the peppers and pan juices over them.
