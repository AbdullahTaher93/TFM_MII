Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Have ready a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Grind the pumpkin seeds in the workbowl of a food processor until you have coarse crumbs. In a bowl, mix the ground seeds with the cheese and spices. Add the egg and mix well. Drop tablespoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, flattening down the mounds with the back of the spoon. Bake 7 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and slide the crisps, still on the parchment paper, off the baking sheet to cool. After a few minutes, slide the crisps off the paper onto a baking rack to finish cooling.
