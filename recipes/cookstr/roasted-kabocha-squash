Preheat the oven to 375°F. To seed the squash, use one hand to hold it steady and the other hand to carefully stick the knife into the center of the squash. Slowly rock or wiggle your knife into the squash on one side, from top to bottom. Turn the squash over and follow the line to the top of the squash, making a complete cut through the squash. Use a fork or dinner knife to pry the squash open. Remove the seeds. Quarter the squash, always putting the flat flesh side down when cutting. Cut each quarter in half crosswise so you have eight crescent-shaped pieces. Add the squash to a 5½-quart Dutch oven; add the pears on top of the slices of squash. Sprinkle the nutmeg over the pears, and drizzle with melted butter. Distribute the brown sugar and salt. Pour in the apple juice. Cover and bake for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven, add 1 tablespoon of cranberry sauce and chopped walnuts to each piece, and serve.
