Peel the cucumber completely, or remove lengthwise strips of peel, leaving some of the cucumber unpeeled, to give the slices an attractive look. Slice lengthwise in half and then in half again. Use a knife or sharp spoon to clean out the seeds. Cut each piece lengthwise in half, then cut crosswise into ¼-inch slices. Place the cucumber in a bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of the salt and let stand for 10 minutes, then transfer the cucumber to a sieve or colander and rinse thoroughly under cold water. Squeeze gently to remove excess water, and place in a shallow bowl. Whisk the vinegar and sesame oil together and pour over the cucumbers. Toss to blend. Set aside until ready to serve (no longer than 30 minutes). Just before serving, taste, and add about ¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste, if you wish.
