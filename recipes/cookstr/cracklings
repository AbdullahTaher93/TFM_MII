In trimming the fat and skin from the poultry, try not to include bits of meat. Place the cut-up skin and diced fat in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the water, and simmer very, very slowly over low heat. When all the water has evaporated and pure yellow fat begins to collect, pour it off and reserve. The fat is completely rendered when the skin forms crisp, brown cracklings. Drain the cracklings on paper towels and use in recipes where called for or sprinkle with salt and eat before someone else does. Although it is not strictly necessary to pour off the fat as it accumulates, it is safer to do so; it will not then become brown by the time the cracklings are finished. The fat should be a bright butter yellow without any tint of brown in it. Store the fat tightly covered in the refrigerator. It will last about one week. Cracklings should be used as soon as possible after they are made, or they will become soggy.
