Whisk together in a small bowl, the vinegar and mustard. Whisk in the oil, salt, pepper, and sugar. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the shrimp, and cook very briefly, just until they turn opaque. Shell the shrimp and chop medium-fine. Place in a bowl and gently mix in the onion and scallions, 2 teaspoons of the parsley, and 4 teaspoons of the vinaigrette. Taste for salt. [May be prepared ahead] Fill each whole piquillo pepper with about 4 teaspoons of the shrimp mixture. Stand them upright on a serving platter, or on individual dishes, filled side down. Arrange the watercress and fris√©e around them and scatter the sliced onions all around. Drizzle the peppers and salad greens with the remaining dressing and sprinkle with the remaining parsley. Serve at room temperature.
