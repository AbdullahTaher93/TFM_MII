FIRST Put the lamb pieces, onions, garlic, ginger, saffron, cinnamon, and chicken broth in a 5-quart casserole with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and let simmer, covered, for 1 hour. SECOND Cut each fennel bulb lengthwise in half, then cut the fennel into slices about Â½ inch thick and 2 inches long. Cut the tomatoes in half, remove the seeds, and chop coarsely. THIRD Add the carrots, fennel, tomatoes, and cilantro bundle to the lamb, stir, cover, and bring the stew again to a boil. Continue to cook over medium-low heat for 40 to 45 minutes, skimming the surface with a spoon to remove any impurities. Add the chickpeas, stir, cover, and continue cooking for about 10 minutes. Remove the cilantro bundle and discard. FOURTH After the chickpeas have been added, prepare the couscous according to the package directions, substituting 1 cup of the lamb broth for 1 cup of the water. Fluff the cooked couscous with a fork to separate the grains, mix in the fresh cilantro, and spoon onto a platter. Ladle spoonfuls of lamb stew on top or serve separately. You may serve with bottled harissa sauce or some chile paste mixed with chopped garlic for extra flavor.
