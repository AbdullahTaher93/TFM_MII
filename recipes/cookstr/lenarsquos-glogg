In a non-aluminum kettle, combine the wine with the cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, orange zest, and lemon zest. Stir to mix and set aside to steep overnight. Next day, add the sugar and warm the mixture over very low heat until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is hot, about 15 minutes. Place 1 almond and 2 or 3 raisins in each glass. Add about 1 tablespoon of Aquavit to each glass and place a silver spoon in each. Pour the hot wine into the glass and serve.
