Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the salt, and make an ice-water bath. Blanch the basil in the boiling water for 15 seconds, just until it is bright green and wilted. Drain and place the basil in the ice-water bath. Remove the basil immediately and dry on paper towels, gently squeezing out any water. In a blender, process the oil and basil until smooth. Strain through a fine sieve, discarding the solids and store in a tightly covered container (or up to 2 weeks).
