Begin by grinding the chia seeds into a fine meal using a coffee or spice grinder, and then add the water, pulsing to combine. Let sit for 5 minutes for the liquid to absorb. Meanwhile, cream together the margarine and sugar in your stand mixer until smooth and homogeneous. In a separate bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, salt, curry powder, mustard powder, and tumeric. Whisk briefly to combine. Add half of the dry ingredients into the mixer, and mix until smooth. Next, incorporate the chia mixture, and the second half of the dry goods. Add in the vanilla, and allow the mixer to continue working until the dough comes together. It may seem very dry, but just be patient and resist the urge to add more liquid. Once you get a smooth dough, divide it into two pieces and wrap each up in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before proceeding. When the dough is thoroughly chilled, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with silpats or parchment paper. Take one ball of dough and roll it out very thinly, to about 1/8th of an inch in thickness. Lightly flour the surface and rolling pin if necessary to prevent sticking. Use the cutest animal cookie cutters you can find, and cut out your shapes, transferring them to the silpat or parchment paper. Quickly slip the sheets of unbaked cookies into the freezer for 15 minutes before moving them into the oven. This will help to prevent the shapes from distorting or spreading. Bake for 9 – 15 minutes, taking into a account how small or thin the animal shapes are and keeping an eye on the cookies so that they don’t burn. Let the cookies cool on a rack before storing in an air-tight container.
