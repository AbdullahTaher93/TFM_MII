Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium- sized skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and saute until golden on both sides, about 10 minutes. Cover and cook 10 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, stirring several times. Add the garlic to the skillet and saute until garlic is golden. Remove chicken and garlic to a medium bowl. Add the water to the skillet. Cook 1 minute, stirring to dissolve any browned-on bits. Pour the liquid from the skillet into a glass measuring cup; discard excess or add water to make Â¼ cup. Add the skillet liquid, the remaining oil, the vinegar, thyme, salt, and black pepper to the chicken and garlic in the bowl; stir together. Stir in beans, tomato, the pepper, and scallions. Spoon onto a bed of leaf lettuce. Serve immediately at room temperature or refrigerate, covered, until 30 minutes before serving. .
