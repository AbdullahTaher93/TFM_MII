The night before you plan to barbecue, combine the marinade ingredients in a blender or food processor. Pour the marinade over the pork in a plastic bag. Refrigerate the chops overnight. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200°F to 220°F. Drain the pork, reserving all of the marinade if you plan to baste the meat during cooking. Let the chops sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. To make the optional mop (see Notes, “To Mop or Not”), bring the marinade to a boil over high heat and boil for several minutes. Keep warm over low heat. Transfer the chops to the smoker. Cook for 2½ to 2¾ hours, basting at 45-minute intervals in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for your style of smoker. 6. When done (see Notes), the pork will pull easily away from the fat and bone. Allow the chops to sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes and pull the pork into shreds. Arrange the pork on a platter with the warm tortillas and garnishes. Serve with Sauce Olé or additional habanero hot sauce.
