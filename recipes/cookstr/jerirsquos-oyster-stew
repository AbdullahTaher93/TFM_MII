Pour the oysters, including all of the liquid, into a large soup pot, and add about 2 cups pure spring water. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Bring nearly to a boil and decrease the heat to a simmer. Cook until the oyster gills curl, about 3 minutes. Add the cream and cook over medium heat until hot, but do not allow to boil. Stir in the butter. Serve in a soup bowl with an extra pat of butter on top. Have lots of soda crackers and Tabasco sauce on the table.
