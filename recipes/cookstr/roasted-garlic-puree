Preheat oven to 350°. Remove the outermost layers of the skin on the garlic heads. Cut the top off so that the garlic cloves are exposed and place them in a shallow baking dish. Heat the olive oil over high heat for 1–2 minutes. Stir the salt into the oil and pour the oil directly over the tops of the garlic. Cover the garlic with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool the garlic. To remove the roasted garlic cloves, gently squeeze the bottom of the head and the garlic should come out easily. Place the roasted garlic cloves on a cutting board and, using the flat side of a chef’s knife, smash the garlic into a purée.
