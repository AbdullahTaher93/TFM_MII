Preheat the oven to 459°. Butter a large (9 X 14 inches) baking dish. Layer the sliced potatoes in the baking dish and sprinkle with the garlic, salt, and pepper. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk and cream and bring to a boil. Pour over the layered potatoes. Bake in the cemter of the oven until the potatoes are brown and tender and a knife easily penetrates them, 35 to 40 minutes. The potatoes should simmer or gently boil while in the oven. If they begin to boil rapidly, or brown before they are tender, reduce the heat by 25 to 50 degrees. 5. Remove the dish from the oven and serve. The potatoes will stay hot for about 30 minutes. (The gratin can be made ahead of time. Let cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate. Reheat by bringing back to room temperature and then placing in a 350° oven for 15 minutes.)
