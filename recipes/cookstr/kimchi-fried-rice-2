Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large wok over medium- high heat. Add the onion, green onions, and carrot, and cook until lightly softened, about 2 minutes. Remove the veggies from the wok and lightly wipe it out with a paper towel. Return the wok to the heat and add the remaining tablespoon oil, along with the mushrooms and garlic. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes, or until the shiitakes soften and become a little glossy. Chop the kimchi. Add the onion mixture back to the wok, along with the ginger and kimchi. Add the rice and stir to distribute. Increase the heat slightly and let the rice sit so some of it crisps on the bottom of the wok. Pour in the soy sauce and sriracha and stir to combine. Stir in the cashews. Reduce the heat to medium-low. In a separate skillet, fry the eggs over easy. To serve, divide the rice between 2 bowls and top each bowl with 1 or 2 eggs and additional kimchi on the side.
