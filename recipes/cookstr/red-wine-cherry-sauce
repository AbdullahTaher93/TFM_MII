To make the sauce, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and saut√© the shallots and garlic until the shallots are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add both broths, red wine, jelly, thyme and cherries. Boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 40 minutes. Reduce the heat and add half of the cornstarch mixture to the hot liquid while whisking. Bring back to a boil and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add more of the cornstarch mixture if a thicker sauce is desired. Sauces thicken quickly with cornstarch. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Do not over whisk.
