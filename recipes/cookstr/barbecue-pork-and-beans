Put the beans in a bowl, cover with at least 3 inches of water, and soak overnight. Or put the beans in a saucepan, cover with 3 inches of water, and bring to a boil. Continue boiling for 3 minutes, remove from the heat, and soak the beans for 1 hour. Drain. While the beans are soaking, rub the pork cubes with 2 teaspoons of the spice rub; wrap well and refrigerate. Cook the bacon in a large deep skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium heat until most of the fat has rendered and coats the bottom of the skillet, about 5 minutes. Remove the cooked bacon and reserve. Turn the heat up to medium-high and brown the pork in the bacon fat, in batches if needed; transfer to a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Add the beans and the bacon, and toss to combine. Add the onion, carrots, and celery to the skillet and saut√© until tender and lightly browned, about 4 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the cumin, the remaining teaspoon of spice rub, and the flour and stir to coat the vegetables. Add the chicken broth and simmer until slightly thickened, stirring often. Stir in the barbecue sauce and tomatoes and pour into the slow cooker. Stir to combine, cover the cooker, and cook for 8 to 10 hours on low, until the beans are tender. Stir and serve.
