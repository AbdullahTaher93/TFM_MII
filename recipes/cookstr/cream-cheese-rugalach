Place cream cheese, margarine, flour, and salt in a large bowl, and work it together with your hands until smoothly blended. Form into a ball, wrap well with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. While dough is chilling, mix sugar, raisins, cinnamon, and walnuts in a bowl. Set aside. When dough is chilled, dust your work surface with confectioners sugar, and roll out half the dough at a time, leaving the remainder in the refrigerator. Roll into a circle about 1?16 inch thick, giving the dough quarter turns as you roll. Sprinkle with a bit of confectioners sugar to prevent sticking. Work quickly; when the dough loses its chill, itâ€™s hard to work with. Cut the circle of dough like a pie into 16 equal wedges. Place a little more than a flatware teaspoon of the mixture on each wedge, and roll from the wide edge to the point into a crescent. Place crescents on an ungreased cookie sheet, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 15 to 20 minutes until lightly browned. Do not overbake; the rugalach will be soft when done.
