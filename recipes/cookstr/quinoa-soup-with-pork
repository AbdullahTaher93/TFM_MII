Heat the oil in a heavy 4-quart saucepan over low heat. Stir in the annatto, then add the scallions, leeks, tomato, garlic paste, and cumin and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Increase the heat to medium, add the pork cubes, and cook for a couple of minutes, tossing so they are well coated with the vegetable mixture. Add the water and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 45 minutes. Add the potatoes, quinoa, and peanut puree. Partially cover and continue to cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Add the peas, basil, and cayenne and cook for a couple of minutes to heat the peas through. Taste for salt and black pepper. Serve hot, garnished with the parsley.
