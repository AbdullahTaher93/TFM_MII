Prep: Take your eggs and butter out of the refrigerator a couple of hours before you make the popovers. Spray muffin pans with cooking spray. Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the milk, butter, flour, and salt using a whisk. Mix until just combined. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs. Blend the eggs into the milk-butter mixture with a whisk until combined (the mixture will have the consistency of pancake batter). Pour batter into prepared muffin pan, filling each cup half-way. Bake for 12 minutes at 375°F. Then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for another 6 to 8 minutes, or until golden brown. I love eating these popovers straight out of the oven with butter and jam, but you can easily spice up this recipe by adding cheese to the layers while pouring the batter into the cupcake pan. If you want to make this recipe sweet, add ¼ cup of sugar to the melted butter.
