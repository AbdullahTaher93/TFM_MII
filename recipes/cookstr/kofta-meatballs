1 Blend all the ingredients except the oil and lemon wedges in a food processor until smooth. 2 Take a small handful of the mixture and, using your hands, roll it into a ball or oval shape. Repeat until you have used all the mixture to make 16 meatballs. If you wet your hands first, it will help prevent the mixture from sticking to them. 3 Heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan and fry the meatballs until they are golden brown and cooked through. Drain on absorbent paper towels and serve with lemon wedges. They are delicious with a green salad and couscous or brown rice.
