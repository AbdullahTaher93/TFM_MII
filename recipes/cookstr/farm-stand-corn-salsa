Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the corn, and cook until just tender, 2 minutes. Drain, run under cold water, and drain again. Pat dry. Combine the corn, tomatoes, jalape√±o, scallions, olive oil, lime juice, and cumin in a medium-size bowl. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 6 hours. Shortly before serving, toss in the cucumber, cantaloupe, and mint, and season with salt and pepper.
