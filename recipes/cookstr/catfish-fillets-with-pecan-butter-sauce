Rub the catfish fillet pieces with as much Cajun or Creole seasoning as you wish. Lightly dust each piece of fish with the flour. Warm the oil and butter together over medium-low heat. Add the fish pieces, and cook them 3 minutes on each side. Thin fillets (about 1/3 inch) will cook completely in 6 minutes and begin to flake; fat fish will be a little underdone. Both states are acceptable at this stage. Pour in the stock, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Remove the fillets that are cooked through as soon as they are coated with the sauce. Fillets that require longer cooking can simmer in the sauce another minute or two. Transfer the fillets to individual plates or a platter. Stir the salt (if needed), pecans, and parsley into the sauce, and spoon equal portions over each piece of fish. Serve the fish immediately.
