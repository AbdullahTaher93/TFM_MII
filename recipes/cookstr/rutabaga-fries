Preheat oven to 425°F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Slice the rutabagas lengthwise into "french fry shapes" (½-inch-wide strips). Put the rutabaga strips in a large bowl and drizzle with oil Toss well so that each piece of rutabaga is coated with oil. Sprinkle fries with salt and pepper. Place rutabaga strips in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake about 20 minutes or until golden brown. (Watch carefully because rutabagas have more sugar in them than baking potatoes and tend to caramelize faster. If the fries are getting too dark too fast, reduce the oven temperature to 400°F.) Season to taste.
