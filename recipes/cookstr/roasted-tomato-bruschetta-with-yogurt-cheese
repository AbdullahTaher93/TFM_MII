Preheat an oven to 300Â°F. Put the tomatoes cut side up in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold them in a single layer. Drizzle with the olive oil. Season with the oregano, crumbling the dried herb between your fingers to release its fragrance. Dot the tomatoes with the minced garlic and season with salt. Bake until the tomatoes are very soft and beginning to caramelize but still hold their shape, 2 to 3 hours, depending on their size and ripeness. Using a pastry brush, baste the tomatoes with any pan juices--the tomatoes may not release much--every 45 minutes or so. Let cool slightly. The tomatoes are best warm, not hot. Preheat a broiler or toaster oven. Place the baguette slices on a baking sheet and toast on both sides until golden brown. Spread one side of each toast with 1 tablespoon yogurt cheese. Top with a warm roasted tomato half. (You can halve the tomatoes lengthwise first so they cover more of the toast surface.) Garnish with the basil leaves and serve immediately.
