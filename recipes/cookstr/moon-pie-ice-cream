METHOD Microwave the chocolate in 15-second increments, stirring in between, until completely melted. In a large bowl, combine the chocolate, milk, vanilla, sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder, lemon juice, and salt. If the mixture is warm, set it aside to cool completely. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until it reaches soft peak. Fold the cream gently into the cooled chocolate milk mixture. Transfer one-third of the mixture to a shallow freezable container. Spread on a third of the Marshmallow Fluff, sprinkle on one-third of the crushed graham crackers, and repeat to fill the container. Don’t stir in a swirl. The ice cream will swirl itself when you scoop it. Cover with plastic wrap or waxed paper pressed directly on the surface of the ice cream, and place it in the freezer for 6 hours. Scoop and serve with whipped cream, shaved chocolate, sautéed bananas, or top with more fluff and toast it with a propane torch. (You have one of those, right?)
