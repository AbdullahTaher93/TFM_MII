Add 2 cups of water to the pressure cooker base; insert the steamer basket and set aside. Break one of the eggs into a 4-cup measuring cup; separate the other egg, adding the yolk to the measuring cup and reserving the white for another use. Add the honey to the eggs and whisk together until well combined, then whisk in the milk. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into six 4-ounce ramekins: cover each tightly with aluminum foil. Arrange the ramekins in the steamer basket, making sure they are level. Close and lock the lid of the pressure cooker. Cook at high pressure (see Notes) for 5 minutes/all cooker types. When the time is up, open the pressure cooker using the 10-Minute Natural Release method (see Notes. Check the flan for doneness (see “Check Custards for Doneness,” page 246). Lift the ramekins out of the cooker. Remove the foil and sprinkle crushed cookies over each flan and serve warm. Or if you prefer to serve them chilled, hold off on the crushed cookies. Instead, let the flans cool for about 30 minutes, then Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Add the crushed cookies just before serving.
