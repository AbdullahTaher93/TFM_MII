Set a rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Stir the oats, flour, pecans, cranberries, and baking soda together in a bowl. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter and brown sugar with a large rubber spatula. Beat in the egg, then the applesauce, cinnamon, and ginger. Stir in the dry ingredients and scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Smooth the top. Bake the bars for about 25 minutes, or until they are firm when pressed with a fingertip. Cool in the pan on a rack. Invert to a cutting board and peel off the paper. Use a ruler to cut into 2-inch bars.
