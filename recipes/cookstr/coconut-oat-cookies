Preheat the oven to 350°F. Oil a cookie sheet and set aside. Whisk together the oats, spelt flour, coconut, baking powder, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Place the coconut milk, rice syrup, oil, and vanilla in a blender and blend briefly to mix. Add to the oat mixture and stir to form a loose dough. Drop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared cookie sheet, leaving enough room between them to allow for expansion Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Variations: • Add grain-sweetened carob or chocolate chips (½ to 1 cup) to the dough.
