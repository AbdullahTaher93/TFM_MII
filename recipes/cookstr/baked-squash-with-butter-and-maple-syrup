Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the squash, cut side down, on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the squash is easily pierced with a fork. Scoop the flesh into a bowl and mash with a potato masher or a fork until fairly smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Combine the butter and maple syrup in a small saucepan and cook, stirring, over low heat until the butter is melted and blended with the syrup, about 2 minutes. Stir half of the syrup mixture into the squash. Transfer the squash to a shallow serving dish. Pour the rest of the syrup mixture over the top.
