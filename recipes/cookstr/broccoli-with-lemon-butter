Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a 4-quart saucepan. Place the steamer in the saucepan. Place the broccoli in the steamer. Cover, and cook for about 5 minutes or until it is tender, but has some crunch left in it. While the broccoli is steaming, start the sauce. Combine the lemon rind, lemon juice and water in a 9-inch skillet. Bring this to a boil and reduce for a minute or so until these juices begin to thicken. When the broccoli is done, whisk the butter, tablespoon by tablespoon, into the frothing juices. When all the butter is in, continue to let the sauce cook, whisking all the while, for 30 seconds. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain the broccoli, pat it dry with towels, and spoon the sauce over the broccoli.
