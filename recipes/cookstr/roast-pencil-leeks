Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Lay the leeks in a large, shallow baking dish or roasting pan, add the oil and salt, then roll the leeks about to coat well. Cook in the blistering oven for about 15 minutes, by which time they should be bronzed in parts. Decant to a serving dish, and spritz with lemon juice.
