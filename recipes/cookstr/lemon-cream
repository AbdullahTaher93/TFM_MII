In the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, whisk the arrowroot into the lemon juice until thick and shiny. Cook until warmed through. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until smooth and lemon colored. Add the lemon juice mixture to the sugar and yolks and stir. Return the mixture to the double boiler and whisk over simmering water for 10 minutes, or until thick. Set aside and keep warm. Serve the Lemon Cream with Angel Food Cake, accompanied with strawberries and raspberries.
