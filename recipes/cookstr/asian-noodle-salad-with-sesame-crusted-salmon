Preheat the oven to 250°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Soak the rice vermicelli in a large bowl of warm water until softened, about 20 minutes. Drain well in a colander, shaking the colander a few times to make sure all the water is removed. Rub each salmon fillet with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt. On a small plate, combine the white and black sesame seeds. Dip the top side of each salmon fillet in the sesame seeds and place on the prepared baking sheet, seed side up. Bake the salmon until the fat between the layers begins to turn whitish and opaque and the fish flakes slightly, or an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers between 125° and 130°F, about 20 minutes. WHILE THE SALMON IS BAKING, MAKE THE SALAD: In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, and ginger. Add the rice vermicelli and toss until the noodles are well coated with the dressing. Add the carrot, celery, green onions, and cilantro. Toss to combine. When the salmon is done, divide the noodle mixture among 4 entrée plates. Place a salmon fillet in the center, on top of the noodles, and serve immediately.
