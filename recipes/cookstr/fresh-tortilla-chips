Fill a deep fryer, deep heavy pot or deep skillet with 3 inches (7.5 cm) of oil and heat to 350°F (l80°C). Using tongs, gently place 4 to 6 tortilla wedges at a time in the hot oil and deep-fry, turning once, until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Salt to taste. Serve chips warm or at room temperature.
