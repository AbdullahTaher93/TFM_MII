Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium low. Cut the bread into 1-inch-thick slices. Press the garlic into a small saucepan using a garlic press. Add the butter, oil, salt, and pepper to taste and cook over a low heat until the garlic begins to sizzle, 5 to 7 minutes. Brush both sides of the bread slices with the garlic mixture, picking up some of the garlic each time, and place on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle with the rosemary and cheese. Pat down gently with your hand to help the cheese adhere. Place the bread slices on the grill, cheese side down, and grill until golden brown. Turn and repeat on the other side. The exact time will depend on the heat of your grill. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Keep warm in foil until ready to serve.
