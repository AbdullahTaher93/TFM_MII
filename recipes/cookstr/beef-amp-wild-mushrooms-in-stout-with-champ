Carbonnade: Season beef to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. In a large, heavy pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear all over, turning with tongs. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Add onion and sauté for about 10 minutes or until beginning to soften. Stir in brown sugar and sauté for about 10 minutes or until mixture is beginning to brown. Stir in flour until blended. Stir in beef broth and stout and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes. Stir in vinegar and bay leaves. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Reduce heat to medium and return beef and any accumulated juices back to pot. Reduce heat, cover and gently simmer for 1½ to 2 hours or until beef is tender. In a skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Cook bacon, mushrooms and onion, stirring, for about 12 minutes or until bacon is cooked and vegetables are softened. Drain off fat and transfer bacon mixture to beef mixture, stirring to combine. Reduce heat to very low, cover and keep warm. Champ: Cut potatoes into uniform chunks. Place potatoes in a large saucepan and add cold water to barely cover. Add salt, cover loosely and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and cook for 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, warm milk. Stir in green onions and bring just to a gentle boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes or until onions are tender and flavors have infused. Drain potatoes well. Return to saucepan over very low heat and shake the pot back and forth to remove any trace of moisture. Using a potato masher, mash in butter. Mash in milk mixture until smooth. Mound a quarter of the champ on each of four warmed individual shallow soup plates, making a little well in the center. Add a small knob of butter to melt. Spoon a quarter of the carbonnade alongside. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.
