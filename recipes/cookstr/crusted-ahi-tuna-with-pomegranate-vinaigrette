In a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, crush the coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and peppercorns. Transfer to a shallow bowl and stir to mix. Lightly season the tuna pieces with salt. Roll each log in the crushed seed mixture until completely covered, including the ends. Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette: in a blender, mix together the pomegranate juice, vinegar, lime juice, shallot, and mustard. Slowly blend in the olive oil until incorporated. Add the basil and chives. Slice the tuna logs into 1/2-inch-thick shingles and layer them on each of 4 plates. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and garnish with sea salt and cracked pepper and, if desired, pomegranate seeds. Garnish each plate with a lime wedge and serve.
