To Make the Rosted Garlic: Peel the loose outer paper from the garlic bulbs and cut about 1/4 inch off the tops to expose some of the clives. Drizzle each bulb with 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Place the bulbs in a terracotta garlic roaster or wrap them in aluminum foil. Bake in a 350Â°F oven for 45-60 minutes, or until the garlic is soft. Not that it takes a little longer to bake garlic in a terracotta garlic roaster than in foil. Serve the garlic immediately, either from the roaster or arranged on a plate. To release the cloves, simply squeeze them from their wrappers. Squeeze any lefotver cloves into a small covered container and refrigerate up to a few days. To Make the Tapenade: Place all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and process just until blended. The tapenade should not be completely smooth. Serve as a dip with crackers. Store any leftover tapenade in a covered container in the refrigerator.
