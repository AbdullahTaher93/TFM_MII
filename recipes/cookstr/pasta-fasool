Place the beans in a medium-size saucepan of lightly salted and peppered water and add the 4 crushed garlic cloves and the parsley sprigs. Bring to a boil and cook until the beans are nearly tender, about 1½ hours, replenishing the water as needed. Drain the beans, discard the parsley and garlic, and save 2 cups of the cooking water. In a large casserole, heat ¼ cup of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook the soffritto of celery and chopped garlic until soft, stirring constantly so the garlic doesn’t burn, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, red chile, black pepper, and water. Stir, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the drained beans and oregano and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding 1 to 2 cups of the reserved bean cooking water while the beans cook, so they are slightly “stewy” looking. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of abundantly salted water to a boil, cook the pasta until al dente, and drain. Transfer the pasta to the beans and cook until creamy, about 5 minutes. Check the seasonings, pour on the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and serve immediately.
