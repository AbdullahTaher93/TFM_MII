Prepare the vinaigrette. Using a fork, mash the anchovies in a small bowl. Mix in the lemon juice. In a separate bowl, combine the sesame oil and olive oil. Alternately whisk the oil and the vinegar, 1 teaspoon at a time, into the bowl with the anchovy-lemon mixture. Whisk in the tarragon and garlic. Cover the dressing and set it aside for at least 20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend at room temperature. In a small saucepan, bring the water and kombu to a boil. Break off tiny pieces of gluten and drop them into the water one by one. Cook these “dumplings” for 10-12 minutes. Transfer the cooked dumplings to a colander and set aside to drain. Place ¾ cup of the salad dressing in a large bowl along with the onion and lemon zest. Add the dumplings while they are still hot. Refrigerate until just chilled, stirring occasionally. While the dumplings are chilling, toast the nori by holding it in one hand and passing it back and forth over a medium-high flame. Tear the toasted nori sheet into irregular bite-size pieces. Just before serving, add the escarole to the marinated seitan and onions. Toss lightly and add dressing to taste. Garnish with olives and nori.
