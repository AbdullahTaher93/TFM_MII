1.?In a large stockpot over medium heat, cook the pasta according to package directions. Remove from the heat, drain, and rinse with cold water. Toss with the olive oil to prevent sticking. Return the pasta to the stockpot and set aside. 2.?In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the vegetable oil. Add the bacun and pan fry it for 2 to 4 minutes, until browned. Remove from the heat. Once the bacun is cool enough to handle, chop it into bits and transfer it to a small bowl. Set aside. 3.?In a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, melt the margarine. Add the flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring well to avoid clumps. 4.?Slowly add the vegetable stock to the saucepan, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low and let simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. 5.?Add the 3/4 cup sundried tomatoes, soy milk, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Remove from the heat. Using an immersion blender (or transfer to a regular blender), purée until smooth and creamy. 6.?Return to the heat (and, if using a regular blender to purée, the saucepan). Add the asparagus and peas to the saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes, until the sauce takes on the thickness and consistency of spaghetti sauce. Remove from the heat. 7.?Transfer the sauce to the stockpot containing the pasta and toss well. You may need to restore to medium-low heat to thicken the sauce and really coat the noodles. The sauce should not be runny. 8.?Place 6 shallow entrée-sized bowls on the counter. Place 2 cups (76 g) of the pasta in each bowl. Garnish with the remaining sundried tomatoes and parsley.
