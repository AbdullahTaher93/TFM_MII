Preheat the oven to 350°F. Prepare the stuffing. Sauté the onion in 2 tablespoons oil until soft. Then add the garlic, tomato purée, chilies, and chicken. Add salt to taste and simmer for about 10 minutes. Briefly heat the tortillas, one at a time, in about 1 inch hot oil. Do not let them get crisp, as they are to be rolled. Heat the cream, and add the chicken stock. Dip each tortilla into the cream mixture, place a generous portion of chicken filling on it, and roll it up. Arrange the rolls in a baking pan, seam side down, and pour the remaining cream mixture over them. Top with the jack cheese and bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Garnish with avocado, hard-boiled eggs, or olives.
