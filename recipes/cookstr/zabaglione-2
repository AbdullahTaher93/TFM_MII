In the top of a double boiler, combine the egg yolks, sugar, Marsala, and vanilla. Place the pan over barely simmering water, and whisk or beat with an electric mixer until the mixture is pale and fluffy and holds its shape, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, preferably with berries or mixed fresh fruits.
