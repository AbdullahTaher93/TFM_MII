Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Combine the milk, sugar, and tapioca pearls in the stoneware. Stir well to mix. Cover and cook on high for 2 to 5 hours. You want the tapioca to be soft and somewhat slimy, but it won’t get thick. In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs with the vanilla. Measure out ½ cup of the hot milk and tapioca mixture and whisk it into the eggs. Add another ½ cup of the hot milk and tapioca, and whisk that into the eggs, too. Then add yet another. Now you’ll have a bowl of yellow tapioca gooeyness. Pour the contents of the bowl into the stoneware, and whisk until it is all thoroughly combined. I cover and cook on high for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the tapioca is pudding-like in consistency. Unplug the cooker and let the pudding sit for about 1 hour to cool. Ladle into serving-size bowls and chill in the refrigerator. Or eat it with a serving spoon, hot, right out of the crock! Your choice.
