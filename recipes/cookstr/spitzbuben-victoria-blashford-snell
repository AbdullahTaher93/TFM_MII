Beat the butter in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugar and beat again until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in the egg and vanilla. Sift in the flour and salt and stir until combined. The dough must be firm enough to roll out; add more flour, if needed. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line 2 baking sheets with wax paper. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to ¼ in (5mm) thickness on a lightly floured surface. Using a fluted 3 in (7.5cm) cookie cutter, gathering and rerolling the trimmings as needed, cut out 18 rounds. Using a plain 1 in (2.5cm) cookie cutter, cut the centers out of 9 of the rounds. Place the rounds on the baking sheets. Bake 10 minutes, until the cookies are pale golden. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Spread each of the solid cookies with about 1 tbsp of the preserves. Top each with a cut-out cookie. Sift confectioner's sugar over the cookies and serve.
