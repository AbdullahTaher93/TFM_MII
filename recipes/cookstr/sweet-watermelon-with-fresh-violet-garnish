Lay watermelon on counter. Cut out two top sections, leaving a “handle” of the outer shell along the top length of the watermelon. Carefully hollow out the watermelon until left with a “watermelon basket”. Cut up the watermelon meat into bite-sized pieces and return to the “basket”. Place violets on top to garnish. Serve.
