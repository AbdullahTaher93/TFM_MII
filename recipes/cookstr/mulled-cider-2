Pour the cider, rum, and herbal tea into a wide saucepan, add the sugar and pour over a low heat to mull. Halve the clementines, stick a clove into each half, and add them to the pan. Break the cinnamon sticks in half, and tip into the pan. Add the bay leaves, bruised cardamom pods and whole piece of ginger, and let everything infuse as the pan comes almost to the boil. Once the pan is near to boiling, turn down the heat, so that it just keeps warm, and ladle into heatproof glasses with handles to serve. To make this into a non-alcoholic warmer, replace the cider and rum with 1 quart of apple juice and ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice. You probably won’t need the sugar, but taste when warm to see if you want a little and the add as you like.
