Fill an Old Fashioned glass with cracked ice. In a mixing glass add simple syrup or granulated sugar and lime quarters. Muddle to extract juice without forcing the rind from the lime. Dump the ice from the glass into the mixing glass, add vodka, and shake. Pour the entire drink into the chilled Old Fashioned glass. Remember, this drink is served with the same ice used during its preparation.
