Preheat the oven to 350°F. Slash the cut surfaces of the eggplant in a crosshatch pattern and drizzle with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season the eggplant with salt, pepper, and the herbes de Provence and place on a baking sheet, cut sides up. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until the flesh is very soft. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature. Scoop out the eggplant flesh and place it in a blender or food processor with the olives. Process until the mixture is well blended and smooth. Preheat the broiler. Place the baguette slices on a baking sheet, brush them with the remaining ¼ cup of olive oil, lightly season with salt and pepper, and broil until golden brown. Spread] teaspoon of the eggplant mixture on each crouton. Arrange the crostini on a platter and serve.
