Place the butter, chili powder, cumin, garlic and cilantro in a mixing bowl and mash together. Season with salt and pepper and mix. Transfer the butter to sheet of waxed paper and mold it into a roll. Wrap the roll with the paper and twist the ends to seal. Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm enough to slice.
