Use a 6-quart slow cooker. Put the meat into the stoneware. Add the chopped carrots, onion, and celery. Add the beans, tomatoes, and pasta sauce. Pour in the beef broth. Season with salt, black pepper, oregano, and Tabasco sauce. Stir to combine. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours, or on high for 4 hours. When the vegetables are tender, stir in Â½ cup of dry pasta. Cover and cook for another hour on low, or until the pasta is al dente. It will swell quite a bit. Garnish with Parmesan cheese.
