Soak the noodles in 3 quarts hot water for 30 minutes, then drain them. (At this point you can store them, covered, for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.) In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, fish sauce or salt, sugar, chile sauce, and 1 tablespoon water. Pour 1 tablespoon of the oil into a large non-stick skillet, and cook the eggs over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon. Once the eggs are barely cooked, transfer them to a plate. In the same skillet (rinsed if necessary), add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Over medium heat, add the garlic and ginger. Sauté for about 30 seconds, then add the carrot and scallions. Sauté for 1 minute more, stirring frequently. Add the lime juice mixture, then the drained noodles. Cook the noodles, stirring constantly, until they are tender but still chewy, about 1 minute. Add a bit more lime juice if you’d like a perkier Pad Thai, and add the sprouts and the scrambled eggs, stirring well. Quickly divide the mixture among plates, sprinkle with the peanuts and cilantro, garnish with the lime slices, if you like, and serve.
