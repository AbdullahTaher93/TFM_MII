In a medium bowl, mash or stir the butter with a fork until it is smooth and slightly fluffy. Add the sugar, honey, salt, and zest. Mix together, mashing with the back of the fork to make sure all the ingredients are incorporated. Taste for seasoning and adjust if desired. On a piece of plastic wrap or parchment, drop the butter in spoonfuls to form a log. Roll the butter in plastic wrap and smooth out to form a round log about 1½ inches in diameter. Refrigerate until hard and easy to cut into pieces. The butter will keep, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week and in the freezer for up to 1 month. Add 1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar to this simple butter for a nice variation. You can also add ¼ cup no-sugar-added preserves to flavor it. I love mixing it with blueberry preserves for a sweet-tart butter.
