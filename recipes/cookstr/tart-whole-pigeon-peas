Put the lentils and water in the slow cooker. Cook on high for 3 hours. After cooking, if there is too much water left, drain and discard the excess water. This should be a dry dish that can pass for a side salad. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Once it’s hot, add the mustard seeds. Cover the pan until the seeds pop (this takes just a few minutes-make sure they don’t burn). Add the curry leaves, onion, ginger, garlic, green chiles, red chiles, and coriander. Cook, stirring several times, until the onions are browned. Add this mixture to the slow cooker along with the salt. Cook for another hour. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Enjoy with hot roti or noon or as a side salad.
