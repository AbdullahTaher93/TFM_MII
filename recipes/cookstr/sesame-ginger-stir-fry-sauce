In a small bowl, combine the broth, soy sauce, cooking wine, sugar, cornstarch, and vinegar. In a small saucepan, heat the oil until shimmering over high heat. Add the ginger and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir the broth mixture, add it to the pan, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thickened and glossy, about 1 minute longer. Off the heat, stir in the sesame oil.
