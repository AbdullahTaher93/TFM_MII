Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, parsley, thyme, and rosemary and cook an additional minute. Stir in the celery, carrots, and tomato puree. In a bowl, using a fork or in a food processor, mash 1 cup beans. Add the mashed beans and the water to the saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, 15 minutes. The recipe can be made ahead until this point. Refrigerate until ready to continue. Add squash and remaining 3 cups beans. Simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper, stir in Parmesan cheese, and let stand a few minutes before serving. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese at the table, if desired.
