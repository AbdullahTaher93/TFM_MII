Cut the rolls in half horizontally and sprinkle the cut sides evenly with the olive oil, vinegar, and chile powder. Drain and flake the tuna, then divide it evenly among the bottom halves of the rolls. Compose the sandwiches by evenly dividing the tomatoes, eggs, anchovies, capers, olives, and lettuce leaves among them. Cover with the roll tops and serve.
