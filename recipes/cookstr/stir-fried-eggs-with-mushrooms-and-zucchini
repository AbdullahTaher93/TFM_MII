In a bowl, whisk together eggs, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and pepper. Set aside. Heat a wok or a large deep skillet over high heat. Add vegetable oil and swirl to coat pan. Add onion and garlic and toss well, until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add mushrooms and toss well. Spread into a single layer and cook, undisturbed, for 30 seconds. Toss well. Cook, undisturbed, until beginning to wilt, about 1 minute. Add zucchini and red pepper and toss well. Cook, tossing often, until mushrooms are tender and zucchini and pepper are tender-crisp, 1 to 2 minutes more. Push vegetables aside. Stir in egg mixture and swirl gently to spread around pan. Cook, undisturbed, for 30 seconds. Gently but quickly stir and scoop to scramble eggs until almost done, about 1 minute. Mix vegetables into eggs as you scramble them, tossing more quickly when they are almost done. When eggs are just cooked, but not dry, remove from heat. Add green onions and dill and toss well. Transfer to a serving plate. Serve hot or warm.
