With a mandoline, cut the lemon into paper, thin slices, shaving the slices directly into a large, shallow bowl to catch all the juices. Layer the sliced tomatoes on top of the lemon. Sprinkle with the bread cubes. Scatter the capers and basil on top. Drizzle with the oil and vinegar. Season with salt. Toss to evenly coat the ingredients. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes to allow flavors to mellow, then serve as a first course or as part of a buffet.
