Preheat oven to 350 degrees Prepare 2 cookie sheets. Stir the egg and spices into the honey. Add the brown sugar and stir until it dissolves. Add the water. Sift the flour with the baking powder and beat into the honey mixture. Fold in the nuts and candied fruit. Knead the dough until it is well blended. It may be difficult to handle, but the kneading will soften it. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Wrap them in plastic and refrigerate for 3 days. Flour a board and roll out the dough, a piece at a time, to a thickness of a ¼ inch. Cut the dough into cookies about 1 inch by 3 inches. Brush off excess flour and place on the cookie sheets. Bake them for 15 minutes. Cool on a cookie rack. When the cookies are completely cool, combine the confectioners’ sugar with the water and spread some on each cookie. When the glaze has hardened, store the cookies in airtight tins and do not consume for a month or more.
