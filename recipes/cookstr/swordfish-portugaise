Arrange the swordfish in a single layer in a lightly oiled shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and rub all over with the lemon juice. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, sherry, and wine. Simmer uncovered for 15 minutes. Stir in the parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Pour the sauce over the fish in the baking dish and scatter the lemon slices over the top. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake just until the fish is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.
