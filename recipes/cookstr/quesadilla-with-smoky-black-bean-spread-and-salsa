Spread the bean dip on a tortilla and place it in a lightly oiled skillet over low heat. Scatter the cheese and cilantro over the beans and add a spoonful of salsa and diced chiles. Top with a second tortilla. Flip it over and warm the second side. When heated through, slide the quesadilla to a plate and cut into wedges. Quesadilla with Roasted Pepper Strips (Rajas): The Roasted Pepper Strips and Onions make a soft, succulent filling for quesadillas. Spread Â½ cup or more over the bottom tortilla; add a little grated cheese or a few dabs of sour cream if you wish and chopped cilantro. Either fold it in half or cover with a second tortilla, flip the whole thing over, and cook on the second side. Cut into wedges and serve with a pile of pickled vegetables. Whole-Wheat Quesadilla with Monterey Jack and Cilantro Salsa: If you can find whole-wheat tortillas, use them here. Set a tortilla on a heavy, ungreased skillet over medium heat. Grate Jack cheese generously over the top. When the cheese has melted, drizzle with Cilantro Salsa, then fold the tortilla in half and serve with a plate of sliced serrano chiles or Pico de Gallo.
