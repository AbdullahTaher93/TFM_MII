Preheat the oven broiler. Place the lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and black pepper in a small bowl, and stir to mix. Set aside. Divide the scallops into 4 portions, and thread each portion onto a skewer (see Notes). Brush both sides of the scallops with the lemon mixture. Place the scallops under the broiler, about 4 inches below the heat source. Broil, occasionally basting with the remaining lemon mixture, for 3 to 4 minutes; then turn the scallops over, and continue to broil and baste for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the scallops are no longer translucent. Divide the salad greens among 4 individual salad plates. Arrange the onion rings and tomato wedges over the greens. Top each serving with a skewer of scallops. Serve with lemon wedges.
