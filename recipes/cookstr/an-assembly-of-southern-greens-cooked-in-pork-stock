Pour the smoked-pork stock into a large Dutch oven or heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the prepared greens in batches, waiting until the first batch wilts into the stock before adding more. (This will seem like an enormous amount of greens, but they cook down considerably and quickly.) Cook, uncovered, over high heat until the greens are just tender, about 15â€“20 minutes. Take care not to overcook the greens. They should be silky and tender but still vibrant green in color. During cooking, season as needed with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Greens are served highly seasoned. When they are done, use a slotted spoon or strainer to remove them from the pot, draining off any excess liquid, and serve hot.
