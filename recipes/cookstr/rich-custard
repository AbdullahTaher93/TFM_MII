Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and 3 tbsp of the milk together in a heatproof bowl until well blended. Bring the remaining milk, cream, and lemon zest to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. Whisk the cream mixture into the yolks. Return to the saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Strain into a bowl. Serve hot or chilled. Variation: Vanilla Custard Omit the lemon zest and replace with 1 split vanilla bean. After the mixture has stood, remove the vanilla and scrape the seeds from the bean into the milk mixture with the tip of a small knife. Complete the recipe as above. The cleaned bean can be stored in a jar of sugar, for at least 2 weeks to make vanilla sugar.
