Make the quinoa: Place all of the quinoa ingredients in a medium bowl and toss to combine. Make the vinaigrette: Cut the oranges into segments; set aside. Squeeze 2 tablespoons juice from the orange shells into a small bowl. Add the vinegar and, whisking constantly, slowly pour in the oil in a thin stream until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Assemble the salads: Toss the baby greens with the vinaigrette to coat. Using tongs, divide the greens among 4 serving plates. Place 3 endive spears on top of the greens on each plate and fill with the quinoa mixture. Arrange the orange segments around the endive. Garnish with chives.
