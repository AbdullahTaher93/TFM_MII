Sear the tofu slices in a wok or heavy skillet in 2 tablespoons oil until they show a little color around the edges. Remove from the pan, drain on paper towels, and reserve. Heat the remaining oil until very hot. Add the ginger, garlic, chiles, and shallot; stir-fry until fragrant. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and spinach. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes; add the sugar and reserved tofu. Cook a few seconds more, tossing well, until the tofu is heated through. Serve immediately.
