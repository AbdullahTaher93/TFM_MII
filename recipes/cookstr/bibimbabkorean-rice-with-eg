Divide up the rice among six bowls that are about 8 inches in diameter at the top and about 2½ inches in height, heaping it in the center in the shape of a mound. (Old-fashioned soup plates may be used.) Put a fried egg on top of each mound of rice. Radiating down from it, in somewhat triangular segments, arrange the Oshitashi, Soy-Bean and Mung-Bean Sprouts Seasoned with Sesame Oil, Korean-Style Cucumber Salad, and the Zucchini Stir-fried with Garlic. Leave a little room for the lettuce leaf “cups.” Mix the kochu chang, sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds and put a dollop in each “cup.” angled, rather like a beak on a parrot’s head.
