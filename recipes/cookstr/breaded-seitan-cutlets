Blot the cutlets with a paper towel to remove surface moisture and set them aside. In a medium bowl, dissolve the arrowroot in the soymilk. In another medium bowl, mix together all the remaining ingredients. Preheat the oven to broil. Lightly oil a baking sheet and set it aside. Dip the cutlets in the soymilk, then roll them in the cornmeal mixture. Press the cornmeal firmly into the cutlets. Place the breaded cutlets on the baking sheet and place them under the broiler about 6 inches from the heat source. Broil for 5-7 minutes, then turn the cutlets over and broil the other side 3-5 minutes. Arrange the cutlets on a serving platter and serve with your favorite sauce.
