Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. In a bowl, toss the shrimp with the mirin, vinegar, oil, and garlic. Let the shrimp sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to the smoker, preferably on a small grill rack, grill basket, or sheet of heavy-duty foil. Smoke them until just cooked through and fragrant, about 15 to 20 minutes at a temperature of 225° F to 250° F. The shrimp are ready when opaque and slightly firm, with lightly pink exteriors. When the shrimp are cool enough to handle, slice each in half lengthwise. Place the shrimp in a bowl and gently mix in the remaining salad ingredients. Refrigerate the salad covered for at least 30 minutes. Serve chilled, topped with the nuts.
