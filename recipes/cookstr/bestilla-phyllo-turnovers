Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken and sprinkle with the ginger, turmeric, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the parsley and almonds. Beat the chicken broth and eggs until well blended and pour into a small saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, until the consistency resembles soft scrambled eggs. Stir into the chicken mixture to bind. This is the bestilla mixture. Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut the sheets of phyllo dough crosswise into fifths. Lay 1 strip down and brush the top with melted butter. Cover the remaining dough with a slightly dampened kitchen towel to keep it from drying out. Combine the granulated sugar and remaining 3 teaspoons cinnamon and sprinkle a little evenly over the buttered strip. Top with another phyllo strip and brush it with butter. Place a heaping teaspoon of the bestilla mixture in the center of the strip about ½ inch from the base. Fold a comer across the filling and continue to fold, as if you were folding a flag, until the strip is all folded into a neat triangle. Brush both sides with melted butter and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining phyllo, cinnamon sugar, and bestilla mixture (see Note, below). Bake until golden, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 5 minutes. Arrange on serving platters and dust the tops with sifted confectioners’ sugar. Serve immediately.
