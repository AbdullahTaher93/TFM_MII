In a large bowl, whisk together the orange juice, lime juice, orange zest, and Â¼ teaspoon salt. Gradually whisk in the oil; the dressing will thicken. Add the cabbage, season generously with pepper and toss. Adjust the seasoning. Let the slaw stand at room temperature for up to 30 minutes to soften and blend the flavors.
