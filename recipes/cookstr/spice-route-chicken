Wash and pat dry the chicken. Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or wide nonstick pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and brown on all sides. You may have to do this in batches. Remove with a slotted spoon. Drain all but 2 tablespoons fat out of the pot. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onions, peppers, and garlic, and cook until wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the coriander, cumin, cinnamon, and bay leaves and stir for 1 minute with a wooden spoon. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste and place it back in the pot. Add the tomatoes and broth. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 45 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, plump the raisins in Â¼ cup warm water, then drain. Add the raisins and olives to the pot 5 minutes before removing from the heat. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, and serve.
