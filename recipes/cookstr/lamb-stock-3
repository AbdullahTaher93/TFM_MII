Preheat the oven to 450°F/230°C (Gas Mark 8). Spread the bones out in a roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes, then add the onion and carrots and continue roasting for 20 minutes more. Transfer the bones to a large pot and add the celery, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, cloves, garlic, and tomato paste. Deglaze roasting pan on the stovetop over high heat with a little water, then add contents of pan to pot. Add 6 qt/6 L of water to the pot, or as much as you need to cover the ingredients completely. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the stock has reduced by half, 4 to 6 hours. Skim any foam that forms on the surface. Strain the stock, discarding the solids. Rinse out the pot, then return the stock to it and simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes longer. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate or freeze in several containers. If desired, refrigerate for about 3 hours, until far rises to the top and solidifies, then remove the fat before freezing.
