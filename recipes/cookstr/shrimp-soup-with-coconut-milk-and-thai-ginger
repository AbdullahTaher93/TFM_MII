1 Combine the coconut milk, chicken stock, and first seasonings in a large stockpot and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, stirring once or twice to prevent curdling. 2 Just before serving, stir the second seasonings into the soup and ladle into individual serving bowls. Serve hot.
