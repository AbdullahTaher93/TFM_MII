In a medium bowl, combine the crab, onion, scallions, tarragon, mint, and lemon zest. In a small bowl stir together the mayonnaise and mustard. Add the mayo-mustard mixture to the crab and toss until the dressing evenly coats the salad. Season with the salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.
