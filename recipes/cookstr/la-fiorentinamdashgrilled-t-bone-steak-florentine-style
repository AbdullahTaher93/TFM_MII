Light the charcoal in time for it to form white ash before cooking, or the wood long enough in advance to reduce it to hot embers. Rub the coarsely ground or crushed peppercorns into both sides of the meat. Grill the steak to the degree desired, preferably very rare, approximately 5 minutes on one side and 3 on the other. After turning it, sprinkle salt on the grilled side. When the other side is done, turn it over and sprinkle salt on it. When the steak is cooked to your taste, and while it is still on the grill, rub the optional garlic clove over the bone on both sides, then drizzle the meat very lightly on both sides with a few drops of olive oil. Transfer to a warm platter and serve at once. I have seen cooks rub the steak with oil before putting it on the grill, but the scorched oil imparts a taste of tallow to the meat that I prefer to avoid.
