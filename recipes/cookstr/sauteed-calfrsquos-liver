Sautéing: The moment before sautéing, season the liver on both sides with a sprinkling of salt and pepper, and dredge in the flour, shaking off excess. Set the frying pan over high heat and film with 1/16 inch of clarified butter or butter and oil. When very hot, lay in the liver and sauté 1 minute on each side. When is it done?: It should be barely springy when pressed with your finger, and a deep pinky red when you cut into a piece. Serve as is, or try one of the suggestions that follow. VARIATIONS Calf's Liver and Bacon: Cook 2 slices of bacon per person and keep warm on a plate lined with paper towels. Pout the bacon fat into a small bowl, wipe the pan clean, and spoon in clear bacon fat. Use that rather than butter for sauteeing, to give the liver a special flavor. Serve the bacon with the liver.
