Dice the tomatoes (no need to remove skin or seeds) into 1/4-inch pieces and place in a large bowl. Add the basil, parsley, onion and shallots. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Pour in the olive oil, water, oregano and vinegar. Marinate for 3 hours at room temperature. Refrigerate prior to serving. May be made a day ahead, but refrigerate after it marinates. Cut bread into 1-inch slices. Toast slightly in oven and rub top and sides with split garlic cloves. When ready to serve, drain off excess liquid. Top the bread with a generous amount of the tomato mixture or serve bread and tomato mixture separately allowing guests to assemble.
