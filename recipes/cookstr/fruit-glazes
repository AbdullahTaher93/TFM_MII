Preheat the oven to 350°F (conventional) or 335°F (convection). Place the cake on an oven-safe plate. Heat the preserves in a saucepan over low heat until the preserves liquefy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the heated preserves to a sieve placed over a bowl and press with a rubber spatula to separate the liquid from the solids. Brush a light coat of the warm preserve liquid onto the cake with a pastry brush. Combine the remaining ingredients in a small bowl and lightly brush the mixture onto the preserve-coated cake. Bake for 5 minutes to seal in the glaze. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool to room temperature before serving.
