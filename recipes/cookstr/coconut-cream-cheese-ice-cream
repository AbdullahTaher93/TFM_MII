Make the crème anglaise (see the Note on cooking a stirred custard and testing for doneness): In a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan, heat the milk, coconut milk, shredded coconut, and ½ cup of the sugar. Once the coconut cream begins to steam, take the pan off the heat. In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks and remaining sugar and briskly whisk for 1 minute. Using a ladle, slowly whisk some of the hot coconut cream into the egg yolk mixture to warm it. Gradually pour the warmed egg mixture into the hot coconut cream mixture, whisking constantly as you pour. Cook the custard over medium heat, stirring continuously and scraping the bottom with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. Remove from the heat and place in the ice bath to cool until it is warm to the touch. Whisk in the sour cream and the cream cheese. Chill the crème anglaise and churn it: Return the crème anglaise (ice cream base) to the ice bath to cool completely. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill a minimum of 2 hours and up to 2 days before churning it in an ice cream machine. Churn the crème anglaise in an ice cream maker according to the machine manufacturer’s instructions. The ice cream is finished once it has increased in volume and it holds the lines from the stirring mechanism and mounds like softly whipped cream. Transfer to the freezer for 4 hours to attain a scoopable consistency. Serving Suggestions: Coconut Cream Cheese Ice Cream is a great accompaniment to carrot cake. I also love to serve it with the Date Cake or the Chocolate Layer Cake.
