Make the stuffing first. Sauté the onion in the butter, add the celery, garlic, thyme or rosemary, and mushrooms. Sauté gently 3 or 4 minutes, then add the breadcrumbs, parsley, and seasonings. Blend thoroughly. The mixture should be fairly dry. Fill the cavities in the chops. Secure the opening with small skewers or toothpicks. Heat the butter and oil in a heavy skillet and brown the chops well on both sides. Add just enough boiling water to cover the bottom of the pan. Cover the skillet tightly. Either simmer atop the stove 35 to 45 minutes or place in a 350-degree oven for the same length of time. The chops should be turned once during the cooking period. They should be tender but not dry. When they are done, transfer to a hot platter and spoon off any excess fat from the juices in the pan. Add brown sauce or gravy to the pan and heat thoroughly. Or add 3 tablespoons of flour, blend well with the pan juices, and let it cook down for several minutes. Then add 1 cup broth or bouillon and stir over medium high heat till the mixture thickens. Correct the seasoning and spoon over the chops. Sautéed apple rings and buttered leaf spinach make good companions.
