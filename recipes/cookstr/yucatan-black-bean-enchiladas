Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. Coat the chorizo with oil. Sprinkle it with the garlic powder and let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to the smoker. Smoke until it is cooked through and juicy, about 55 to 65 minutes at a temperature of 225° F to 250° F. Leave the smoker on. When it’s cool enough to handle, slice the chorizo into thin rounds and then cut the rounds into quarters. Place the chorizo pieces in a Dutch oven or other large, smokeproof baking dish. Add the beans, mezcal, and lime juice and stir to combine. Transfer the bean mixture to the smoker and cook it for 30 minutes or until the beans are heated through and nicely flavored with smoke. (The beans can be prepared to this point 1 to 2 days ahead, covered, and refrigerated. Rewarm before proceeding). While the beans smoke, prepare the tortillas. In a small skillet, warm ¼ to ½ inch of oil until it ripples. Dip the tortillas into the oil, one at a time, for a very few seconds, just until the tortillas go limp. Drain the tortillas and keep them warm. Grease a shallow baking dish, preferably about 13 inches long and 7 to 9 inches wide. When the beans are ready, stir the mint into them. Dip a tortilla in the warm enchilada sauce and spoon about 3 tablespoons of beans over it. Roll the tortilla up snug and transfer it to the dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, sauce, and filling. Quickly heat the remaining enchilada sauce in a small saucepan to bubbling. Pour the sauce over the enchiladas and top with cheese. (The enchiladas can be made to this point 2 hours ahead, covered, and refrigerated. Return the dish to room temperature and reheat it in a 350°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.) Garnish with limes and mint, if you wish, and serve immediately.
