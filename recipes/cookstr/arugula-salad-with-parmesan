Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and salt in a large non-metallic bowl. Add the arugula and toss together. Arrange the arugula in a serving bowl. Use a vegetable peeler to shave curls of the Parmesan over the arugula. Add a generous amount of freshly ground pepper and serve. Variation: Watercress Salad: Other peppery leaves would work well in this recipe, in place of arugula. Try using watercress, endive, or radicchio, or a colorful combination, depending upon what is in season.
