Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C. Grease an 8-inch (20-cm) baking pan with coconut oil. While the oven is preheating, steam the beet on the stovetop until it can be easily pierced with a fork. Once the beet is done, puree it in a food processor with the milk, banana, cocoa or cacao powder, sugar, and vanilla extract. Sift the flour and baking powder together in a bowl. Fold the wet ingredients into the dry, and stir in the walnuts (if using). Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool, then serve.
