Peel the pineapple and remove the "eyes." Slice into rounds about ½ in (1/3 mm) thick, reserving any pineapple juice. Cut out the core using a small round cookie cutter or the tip of a sharp knife. Place the pineapple and its juices, rum, and lime juice in a large frying pan and cook over medium-low heat about 1 minute, just until the liquid is warm. Carefully ignite the pan juices with a long-handled match. Cook until the flames die down. Dot the pineapple with the butter and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Cook while gently shaking the pan until the butter and sugar combine into a glaze. Spoon into dessert dishes and serve hot, dusted with the cinnamon.
