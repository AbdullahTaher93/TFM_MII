Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly oil or coat two large baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, flaxseed, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. Combine the sugar and oil in a large bowl and beat on medium speed until well blended, 1 minute. Add the egg and molasses and continue to beat until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary. At low speed, gradually beat in the flour mixture until just combined. With your hands, roll the dough into 1¼-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring the cookies to a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining dough. To make the glaze, place the powdered sugar and milk in a bowl and stir until well combined. If the glaze is too thick, add a few drops of milk as needed. Drizzle over each cookie in a lattice or squiggle design.
