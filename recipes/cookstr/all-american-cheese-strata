Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Butter an 8 x 8-inch glass pan. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the milk, eggs, salt, and pepper. In a medium-size bowl, toss the cheeses together. Place 2 pieces of bread on the bottom of the prepared pan. The bread should cover most of the bottom. If it does not, add another piece of bread or part of one to fill in the gap. Sprinkle with one-third of the cheese. Place the second layer of bread over the cheese and again, fill in any large gaps with extra bread. Carefully pour the milk and egg mixture over the entire casserole. It will seem like a lot, but the bread will soak it up as it cooks. Top with the remaining cheese. (At this point you can cover and refrigerate the strata for up to 24 hours before baking.) Bake for 45 to 50 minutes. or until the casserole is very puffy and the cheese golden brown on top. Let sit for about 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
