Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. To Make the Cookies: In a cup or small bowl, make “buttermilk” by combining the rice milk and cider vinegar. In another small bowl, combine the water and flaxseed meal and allow to thicken for 3 to 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together the baking mix, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the sugar and shortening until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat in the flaxseed mixture and vanilla extract. With the mixer on low, alternately add the dry ingredients and the “buttermilk” mixture, starting and ending with the dry ingredients; mix until it is smooth. Scoop the dough with a small ice cream scoop onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake the cookies for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the cookies are golden and the tops are puffy. The cookies will also spring back when they are touched. Transfer the baking sheets from the oven to cooling racks and cool for 10 minutes, then transfer the cookies directly onto the racks to cool completely. When completely cooled, frost half of the flat side of each cookie with the white (vanilla) icing and half with the black (chocolate) icing. To Make the Icing: In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, golden syrup, and vanilla. Add in 2 tablespoons of the water and stir until the icing is smooth. If the icing seems too thin to spread on the cookies, add a bit more sugar. If it seems too thick, add a little more water. Divide the icing into two batches. To make black (chocolate) icing, add the 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to one of the batches of icing. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of water to the chocolate icing one teaspoon at a time or until it reaches spreading consistency. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
