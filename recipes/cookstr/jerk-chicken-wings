Chop off the chicken wing tips; discard them or save them for making stock. Cut each wing in half at the joint. Place the pieces in a 4-quart slow cooker. In a food processor or blender, combine all the remaining ingredients except the honey and process to a smooth, barely pourable paste. Scrape the paste into the cooker and toss to coat the wings. Cook, covered, on the low setting for 4 to 6 hours, until the wings are tender but not quite falling off the bones. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Using tongs, remove the chicken wings from the cooker and arrange them on a nonstick sheet pan in one layer so that the pieces aren’t touching one another. Drizzle the honey, if using, over the wings. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the wings are crisp and starting to brown. Serve the wings hot or at room temperature.
