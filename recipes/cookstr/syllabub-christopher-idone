In a food processor, lightly pulse the macaroons until finely crumbled, do not over process. Measure out 1 cup of crumbs and set aside. Place the sugar in the food processor and mix for about 1 minute. Add the cream and process for 1 minute. Blend in the rum and lemon juice. Turn into a bowl and refrigerate for 2 days. When ready to serve, fold in the macaroon crumbs. Serve in chilled cups, dusted with the instant espresso coffee.
