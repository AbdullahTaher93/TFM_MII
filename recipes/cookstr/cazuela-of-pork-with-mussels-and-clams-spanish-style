If serving as soon as dish is finished, place mussels and clams in a large bowl and cover with cold salted water. Sprinkle with a little cornmeal and set aside. Combine broth, wine, and ground chile in a large bowl, and stir until thoroughly blended. Add 2 minced garlic cloves, bay leaf, and pork. Marinate 30 minutes at room temperature, turning the meat occasionally to keep it moist. With a slotted spoon, remove pork, discarding bay leaf. Reserve marinade. Pat pork dry with paper towels. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork; cook, turning frequently to brown pork quickly and evenly. When browned, add the reserved marinade, and bring to a boil over high heat, scraping bottom and sides of pan, until pork absorbs the marinade and mixture is thick. Heat olive oil in another large deep skillet, then add pepper strips. After turning peppers once, add onions and stir-fry about 5 minutes or until vegetables are soft, but not brown. Add remaining garlic, tomatoes, and crushed chile. Drain and rinse mussels and clams. Spread mussels and clams, hinged-side down over the tomato sauce, cover the skillet tightly and cook over high heat 10 minutes or until the mussels and clams open. Discard any mussels or clams that do not open. Stir in the pork with marinade and simmer 5 minutes or until pork is heated through. Mix the cilantro and green onions and sprinkle over the pork and clams. Garnish with lemon wedges. Serve over rice.
