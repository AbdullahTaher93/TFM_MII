Place the chicken wings in a large stockpot and pour in enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, skimming the scum that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, skimming often, for 20 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients. Simmer for 2Â½ hours. Strain the stock, cool slightly, and skim off the fat that rises to the top. (Alternatively, chill in the refrigerator overnight. Remove the fat that accumulates on the surface.) Return the stock to the stockpot and bring to a strong simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by one third to concentrate the flavor.
