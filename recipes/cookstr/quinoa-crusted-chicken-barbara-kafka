Pour the chicken stock into a wide bowl. Set aside. Place the quinoa on a large flat dinner plate. Set aside. Place a chicken breast flat on a cutting board skinned side up. Cut in half down the middle. Turn each half over and pull off the- strip of flesh that is the chicken tender. Wrap the tenders in plastic wrap or foil. Set aside. Repeat with the other breast pieces. One half-breast at a time, put your palm flat on each piece. Slide a knife parallel to the cutting board through the chicken, resulting in two thin cutlets from each half-breast. There will be eight cutlets total. Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of the oil in a large pan over high heat until slightly blue but not smoking. In the meantime, dip both sides of two pieces of each breast into the stock. Then, one at a time, dip both sides of the breast pieces into the quinoa. Reduce the oil heat to medium and place a pair of chicken pieces next to each other in the hot oil. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the flesh turns opaque. Move the cooked pieces to plates or a platter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Serve with the lemon wedges.
