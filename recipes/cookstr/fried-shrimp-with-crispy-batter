Whisk the water into the flour in a small mixing bowl. As soon as the batter is smooth—don’t worry about a few lumps—stop whisking so you don’t overwork the batter and make it tough. Stir in the yeast and its soaking liquid, cover the batter with plastic wrap, and let it sit in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours or until doubled in volume (exact timing depends on the temperature of your kitchen). Heat the oil in a heavy pot large enough so that the oil doesn’t come higher than halfway up the sides. If you have a frying thermometer, heat the oil to 370°F. If you don’t have a thermometer, drop a dollop of batter into the oil. When the batter rises, surrounded with bubbles, within 5 seconds, the oil is ready. Start slowly—a couple of shrimp at a time—until you get a sense of how the oil is behaving. Ideally, the shrimp should take about 1 minute to brown—this ensures that they are cooked through (which they won’t be if the oil is too hot). If the oil isn’t hot enough, the batter will be soggy. Fry the shrimp, about 6 at a time, drain on paper towels, sprinkle liberally with salt, and serve immediately with the mayonnaises and/or chutneys, if desired.
