Combine the garlic, thyme, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large bowl. Stir well, then add the rabbit pieces and turn to coat them well. Cover loosely, and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Combine the beef stock and pitted olives in a food processor or blender, and puree until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, stir in the vinegar and tomato paste, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large ovenproof skillet. Sauté the rabbit over medium heat, turning it once or twice, until golden, 10 minutes. Pour the olive sauce over the rabbit, and heat it to a simmer. Then transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 1 hour, turning and basting the rabbit pieces every 10 minutes. Serve hot.
