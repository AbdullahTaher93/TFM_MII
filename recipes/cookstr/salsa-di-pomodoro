Stir the tomatoes, onion, and chopped basil together in a large pot. Season to taste with salt. Cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring often. A few cups at a time, pass the mixture through a food mill. Return the sauce to a clean pot with the olive oil, basil leaves, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
