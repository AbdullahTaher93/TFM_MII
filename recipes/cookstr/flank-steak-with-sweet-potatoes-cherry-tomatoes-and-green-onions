Whisk the ¼ cup oil, the vinegar, cumin, oregano, and ½ teaspoon salt together in a glass baking dish. Add the flank steak, turn so the meat is well coated, and then cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight. Place the sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until the sweet potatoes are tender when easily pierced with the tip of a knife but still hold their shape, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Remove the steak from the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat your grill to high or heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Place the steak on the hot grill and cook for about 4 minutes, or until browned, before turning. Cook the second side for about 3 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer the flank steak to a cutting board and let it rest while you finish the garnish. Heat the 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the sweet potatoes and let them cook, undisturbed, for about 2 minutes before turning them. Cook for about 2 minutes more, or until golden brown and crisp. Add the cherry tomatoes and sauté until they begin to blacken, about 2 minutes. Add the green onions and stir for about, 1 minute; they should soften but retain their bright green color. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large platter. Slice the steak against the grain into ½-inch slices. Fan the slices of steak around the vegetables and drizzle the Guava Sauce over the steak. Season with a sprinkling of salt and some pepper. Combine the guava paste and the garlic with 2/3 cup cold water in a small saucepan over medium heat. When the guava paste has dissolved, add the olive oil, white wine, and salt. Simmer for 2 minutes, whisking to combine the ingredients. Let cool completely.
