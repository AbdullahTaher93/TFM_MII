Measure 3Â½ cups flour; sift together with spices, baking soda and salt; set aside. Beat butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add sugar and mix on high speed until light and fluffy, 2 minutes. Add egg and mix well. Stop the mixer and add molasses and lemon rind. Mix on low speed to combine. Stir in dry ingredients with a wooden spoon. Divide dough into four parts. Wrap each one separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease baking sheets. Remove one piece of dough from the refrigerator at a time. Roll the well-chilled dough on a floured board or between sheets of wax paper to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out with cookie cutters and carefully transfer to prepared baking sheets, leaving 1 inch between each cookie. Bake just until the cookies are lightly browned and set, 7 to 10 minutes. Do not overbake. Transfer from baking sheets to a wire rack and cool completely before decorating. Decorate as desired. Store in airtight containers.
