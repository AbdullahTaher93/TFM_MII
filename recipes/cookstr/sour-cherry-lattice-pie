Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C) On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough and fit into bottom of pie pan, leaving edges untrimmed. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine cherries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, almond extract, ginger and cardamom. Stir together to coat evenly and let stand about 15 minutes, so the cherries start releasing juices. Spoon into bottom crust. Smooth top and dot with butter. Roll out the second crust. Weave the strips over top of the cherry filling. Seal and crimp edges, trimming off any excess dough. Place pie on a baking sheet to catch juices. Bake in preheated oven until top starts to brown and cherries are bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before cutting. Variation: You can use 2 lbs (1 kg) frozen cherries in a pinch. Thaw out prior to use. Drain off juices before measuring.
