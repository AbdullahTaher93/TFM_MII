Make the salad: In a small bowl, combine the onion and vinegar and let stand for 1 hour. While the onions are pickling, combine the remaining ingredients for the salad in a medium bowl, toss well, cover, and refrigerate. When the onions have been soaking for an hour, drain them, discard the vinegar, and add to the salad. Thread the shrimp, bacon, bell pepper, and scallions alternately onto skewers. Sprinkle the skewers with the oil and salt and pepper to taste and grill over a medium fire for 3 to 4 minutes per side. To check for doneness: Cut into one of the shrimp to be sure that it is opaque throughout. Remove the skewers from the grill. Place the salad on a serving platter or individual plates, top with the skewers, and serve.
