Heat the oven to 500Â°F with a rack in the center. Put the tomatoes into a shallow 9-x-13-inch roasting pan. Add the olive oil and roll the tomatoes in it until thoroughly coated. Sprinkle with salt. Roast for 10 minutes. Shake the pan to turn the tomatoes around. Add the orange zest, garlic, and cardamom seeds around the tomatoes so that they are resting on the pan. Roast for 15 minutes.
