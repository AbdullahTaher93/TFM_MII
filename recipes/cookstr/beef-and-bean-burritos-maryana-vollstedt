To Make the Burritos: Warm the tortillas (see Notes). Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium heat, combine beef, onion, and garlic and saut√©, breaking up meat with a spoon, until meat is browned and vegetables are tender, 6 to 7 minutes, adding a little oil if needed. Season with chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir in beans, salsa, and cilantro and simmer about 5 minutes longer. To assemble, spoon some filling on the lower one-third of a tortilla and sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon cheese. Fold the bottom edge up halfway, pressing gently over filling. Fold over the sides to completely cover the filling and finish rolling. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Serve with sour cream, salsa, and avocado slices. To make the Fresh Tomato Salsa: In a medium bowl, stir together all ingredients. Cover and let stand at room temperature at least 1 hour to allow flavors to blend, then cover and store in refrigerator until ready to use. Drain, if necessary, before using. Homemade salsa is best eaten the same day as prepared.
