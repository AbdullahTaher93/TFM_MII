Bring the milk, butter, and nutmeg to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the semolina and stir until the mixture forms a dough. Gradually beat in the egg. Season with salt and pepper. If needed, adjust the consistency with a little more semolina or milk to make a soft, but malleable, dough. Bring a pot of stock to a boil over high heat. Using 2 spoons, shape the semolina mixture into small dumplings, and drop them into the stock. Reduce the heat and simmer about 10 minutes, or until the dumplings are firm. Serve hot. 3.
