In a bowl, combine bread crumbs and butter. Set aside. In a separate bowl, combine pears, lemon juice, cranberries and brown sugar. In a greased slow cooker stoneware, spread one-third of the bread crumb mixture. Layer half of the pear mixture over top. Repeat. Finish with a layer of crumbs and pour cranberry cocktail over top. Cover and cook on High for 4 hours, until fruit is tender and mixture is hot and bubbly.
