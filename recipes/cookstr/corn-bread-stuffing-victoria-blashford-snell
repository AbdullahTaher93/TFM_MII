Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Place the corn bread on a baking sheet. Bake for about 15 minutes, until toasted and golden. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Melt the butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and red pepper. Cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until tender. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir into the cornbread. Add the sage and season with salt and pepper. Mix in the egg, if using. Add enough of the stock to moisten the cornbread without making it soggy. Spread in a buttered baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil and bake about 30 minutes, until heated through. If you like crispy stuffing, remove the foil after cooking for 15 minutes. Serve hot.
