In a food processor, puree the basil, pine nuts, cheese, and garlic. Slowly add the oil to make a thick paste. Stir in the butter and season to taste with salt. If not using immediately, scrape into a jar or plastic container with a lid and pour a thin layer of olive oil on top. It will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks, or it can be frozen for several months. Thaw and stir before using.
