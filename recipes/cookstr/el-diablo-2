Juice the lime half with a citrus squeezer, reserving the inverted hull. Pour the tequila, grape juice, and lime juice into a tall collins glass filled with ice. Top with ginger ale to about ½ inch (13 mm) from the top of glass. Stir gently. Place the inverted lime hull into the top of the cocktail, rind side up, and fill the “lime bowl” with créme de cassis. Serve immediately with a straw.
