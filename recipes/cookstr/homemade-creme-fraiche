Place the heavy cream in a small bowl and add the sour cream. Whisk to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until thick, 12 to 18 hours (the sour cream or buttermilk protects the cream from developing harmful bacteria while it is thickening). Once thickened, the crème fraîche can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 1 week.
