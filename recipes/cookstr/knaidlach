Beat the eggs lightly with cold water. Add the chicken fat and stir until the fat dissolves. Add ½ teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Gradually beat in the matzoh meal, 2 tablespoons at a time, proceeding slowly as it thickens so you do not add too much. The mixture should be as thick as light mashed potatoes, and just a little soft and spongy. Chill for 5 to 7 hours. Half an hour before serving time, bring 2½ to 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add a handful of salt, as for pasta. With wet hands, or two tablespoons dipped intermittently in cold water, shape the mixture into balls about 1 inch In diameter. Drop gently into the boiling water, cover the pot loosely, and let boil at a moderately brisk pace for about 25 minutes. When one ball tests done (cut it open and see if it is light and cooked all the way through), remove all carefully with a slotted spoon. Serve in hot chicken soup. Variation: Variation: To make fried matzoh balls, chill the cooked balls overnight. In the morning, cut Into slices between ¼ and ½ inch thick and fry slowly in hot butter or margarine, turning so both sides become golden brown and the slices are thoroughly heated.
