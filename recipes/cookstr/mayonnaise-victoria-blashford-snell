Place the egg yolks, vinegar, and mustard in a food processor. Process for about 1 minute, until pale and creamy. (Or whisk by hand.) With the machine running, slowly pour in the oil through the feed tube in a thin, steady stream, processing until the mayonnaise is thick and creamy. (If making by hand, dribble in the oil.) Add the lemon juice and pulse briefly (or stir) to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Variations: Substitute 3 tbsp of a flavored oil (hazelnut, walnut, basil, or lemon) for an equal amount of the olive oil. Or stir Chinese chile paste, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, crushed garlic, or chopped fresh herbs into the finished mayonnaise to taste.
