Trim root and top of the fennel bulb and discard any tough outer leaves. Halve it and slice each half very thinly, if possible on the mandoline. Peel and halve the pears. Scoop out the cores and stem ends using a melon baller or small spoon. Cut each half into thin crescent slices. Brush them with lemon juice so they do not discolor and cover tightly with plastic wrap, pressing it down so all air is excluded. For the dressing: Whisk the vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper in a small bowl until mixed. Gradually whisk in the oil so the dressing emulsifies and thickens slightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Shortly before serving: Wash and dry the watercress, discard stems, and arrange the sprigs on 4 individual plates. Arrange the pear and fennel slices in a fan on top. Whisk the dressing lightly to reemulsify it, then spoon it over the pears and fennel. Sprinkle with pinenuts and shave a few slices of Parmesan onto each plate. Serve the salad as soon as possible, within a half hour. From Good Food NO FUSS by Anne Willan, 2003 Photo CREDIT: Simon Wheeler
