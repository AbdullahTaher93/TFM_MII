Combine the tea and boiling water in a teapot or other heatproof container until steeped, about 10 minutes. Strain the tea into the slow cooker and add the fresh ginger, brown sugar, peach juice, and lemon juice. Cover and cook on Low until hot, 1 to 2 hours. When ready to serve, scoop the ginger slices out of the liquid and add the ginger brandy. Turn the heat down to the Keep Warm setting if your slow cooker has that function; otherwise, keep it on Low to serve. Float lemon slices on the top, if desired.
