Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with wax paper. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler and when it is half melted, add the butter and continue to melt. When the chocolate is completely melted, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly. Whisk in the condensed milk slowly. Gradually beat in the sugar; it all goes in eventually. Beat in the peanut butter. Spread the mixture in the pan and chill until firm, preferable overnight. Cut it into 25 pieces. Store in the refrigerator.
