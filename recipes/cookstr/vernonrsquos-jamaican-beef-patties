Make the filling: Mix together the onion, scallion, hot pepper, and beef in a medium bowl. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meat mixture, breaking up the meat with a spoon, and cook until it is brown all over, about 5 minutes. Stir in the thyme, curry powder, salt, pepper, and ½ cup water. Cover and cook for 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool. Add the bread crumbs and mix well; set aside. Make the pastry: Mix the flour with the curry powder and salt in a medium bowl. Using a pastry blender or 2 forks, cut the shortening into the flour mixture until the mixture looks like small peas. Gradually add the ice water, mixing just until the pastry comes together. Gather the pastry in a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Transfer the pastry to a lightly floured board and roll out ¼ inch thick. Flour the top edge of a 2½-inch-wide drinking glass and cut out 24 circles. Roll out each circle 1/8 inch thick and about 6 inches in diameter. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease a baking sheet. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the filling onto the upper half of each round, then fold the bottom pastry up into a half-moon shape. Crimp the edges closed with a fork. Arrange the patties on the baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 24 patties, serves 6
