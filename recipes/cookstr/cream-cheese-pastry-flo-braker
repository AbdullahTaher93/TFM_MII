In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and salt and pulse 3 or 4 times to blend. Scatter the butter pieces over the flour mixture. Pulse until the mixture is the consistency of cornmeal. Scatter the cream cheese cubes over the mixture and pulse just until the ingredients come together in a ball. On a clean work surface, divide the dough in half and shape each half into a 5-inch disk about ¾ inch thick (12½ ounces/355 grams), or divide as directed in individual recipes. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours, before using. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. For longer storage, overwrap with aluminum foil, label with the contents and date, and freeze for up to 2 weeks. Thaw in the refrigerator for 4 hours or up to overnight and then use well chilled as directed in individual recipes.
