Trim chicken and pound between two sheets of plastic wrap to an even ½-inch thickness. Combine buttermilk, onion, garlic, oil, hot pepper sauce, mustard, dried thyme, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Add the chicken breasts pressing down to submerge completely. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 1 day, turning chicken occasionally. For the breading, combine the breadcrumbs, flour, cheese, thyme, paprika and cayenne in a pie plate. Set a rack on a foil-lined baking sheet. Remove chicken from buttermilk and dredge in the breadcrumbs, turning and coating well. Place chicken on the rack and refrigerate for 1 hour to set the crust. Preheat oven to 425°F. Drizzle chicken with melted butter and bake on the rack for 20 to 25 minutes or until cooked through and golden.
