Stem the spinach and rinse the leaves thoroughly. Drain the spinach, then coarsely chop. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Trim the scallions and cut into pieces. Place the scallions, ricotta, olive oil, lemon juice, and mint in a blender or food processor; pur√©e until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. When the water comes to a boil, add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot, off the heat. Add the chopped spinach and ricotta mixture; toss until well combined and the spinach is barely wilted. Serve immediately or the dish will turn gummy.
