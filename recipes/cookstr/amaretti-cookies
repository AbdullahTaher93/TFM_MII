Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease three baking sheets with vegetable spray or line with parchment paper. Using a food processor, pulse the 3 cups of almonds until they are finely ground. In a separate bowl, beat eggs, sugar, and almond extract. Add the ground nuts and gently fold them together until you have a moist mixture that you can form into balls. Using a teaspoon or your fingers, scoop up the batter and form balls, and then roll them in the confectioner’s sugar. Place the balls at least an inch apart on the greased baking sheet. Prior to baking, press one almond into each ball. Bake for about 15 minutes or until the cookies are golden in color and firm to the touch. Let them cool before removing them from the baking sheets.
