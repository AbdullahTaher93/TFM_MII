In a shallow nonreactive dish, stir together 1 cup of the salsa and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the fish, cover, and marinate at room temperature, turning once or twice, for 1 hour. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. With tongs, dip the tortillas one at a time in the hot oil, turn them, and then transfer to paper towels to drain. The tortillas should not be in the oil more than a few seconds, and they should not blister or become crisp. Set aside at room temperature. Combine the lime cream and the garlic and transfer, if desired, to a squeezed bottle. Meanwhile, light a direct-heat charcoal fire and let it bum down to medium-hot (5 seconds to “ouch”) or preheat a gas grill to medium-high. Position the grill rack about 6 inches above the heat source. When the grill is ready, lift the fish from the marinade (reserve it) and lay the fish on the rack. Cover and grill, turning the fish once and basting with the reserved marinade, until the marinade is used up and the fish is just cooked through while remaining moist, about 9 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board. Roughly chop the fish and transfer to a bowl. Add the avocado, onion, cilantro, ¼ cup salsa, and salt. Toss gently. Adjust the seasoning. For each taco, stack 2 tortillas on a plate. Top each with about 1/3 cup of the fish mixture and about ¼ cup of the slaw. Squirt with lime cream and serve immediately, passing the remaining 1 cup salsa at the table.
