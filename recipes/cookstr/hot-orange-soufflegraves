Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Brush six 7oz (200ml) ramekins with some of the butter. Dust the insides of the ramekins with sugar, making sure there are no gaps. Whisk the flour into the remaining butter and let bubble over medium heat without browning for about 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes. Whisk in the orange zest and juice and all but 1 tsp of the sugar. Remove from the heat and beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Whisk the whites to soft peaks, then beat in the remaining sugar. Stir a dollop of the whites into the saucepan, then fold in the remainder. Divide among the ramekins. Using a knife, make a shallow circle around the ramekins about ¼ in (6mm) in from the edge. Place on the hot baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, or until the soufflès have risen but look slightly unset in the center. Serve immediately.
