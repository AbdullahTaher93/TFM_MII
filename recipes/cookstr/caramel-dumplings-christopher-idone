The dumpling dough: In a mixing bowl, combine the dry dough ingredients with lemon zest. Mix in the egg, milk, and melted butter and beat just until the batter is smooth. The poaching liquid: In a large saucepan, dissolve the brown sugar and butter in 2 cups water and bring to a simmer over moderate heat. The caramel sauce: Place the granulated sugar in a heavy saucepan and melt over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar is dissolved and becomes a golden brown. Add the heavy cream, stir in the butter, and mix until smooth. Reserve. The dumplings: Working in batches if necessary, use a large oval soup spoon to drop the dough by spoonfuls into the poaching liquid. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Turn the dumplings over and cook, covered, for 3 to 5 minutes more. Remove with a slotted spoon, place one dumpling on each serving plate, spoon the caramel over, and sprinkle with the lemon and orange zests.
