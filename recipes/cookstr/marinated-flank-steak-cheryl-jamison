Place the steaks in one layer in a shallow nonreactive pan. Combine the ingredients for one of the two marinades and pour the marinade over the steaks. Cover the pan and refrigerate it at least 12 hours, preferably twice that long. Turn the meat occasionally during the marinating. Fire up enough charcoal to form a single layer of coals beneath the meat if you are grilling outdoors, or heat the broiler. Remove the steaks from the marinade reserving the liquid if you used the Peppa version. Discard the red-eye marinade, which would become bitter if reheated. Grill the meat uncovered over hot, ashen-gray coals for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until the steaks are done to your taste. Broiling should take about the same amount of time. Let the meat rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing it thin across the grain. If you used the Peppa marinade, bring the liquid to a boil in a small saucepan, allowing it to reduce by about a third, a matter of just a few minutes. Spoon some of it over the sliced meat. Serve the meat immediately.
