Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 10-inch springform pan or 9-inch square pan. Remove a thin slice from the stem end of the orange and cut the fruit into eighths, leaving the peel on. In a food processor, combine the orange segments and raisins and process until finely ground. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar with a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well. Mix in the orange mixture. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir to blend. Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture alternately with the yogurt or buttermilk in 2 increments, beating until blended. Reserve ¼ cup of the chocolate for the topping and mix the remainder into the batter. Spread evenly in the prepared pan. Sprinkle the reserved chocolate evenly over the top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then remove the pan sides. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature, cut into wedges.
