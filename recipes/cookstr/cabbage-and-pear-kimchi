Toss the cabbage with the salt in a large bowl. Let it sit until it exudes liquid and wilts, 60 to 90 minutes. Lift the cabbage out of the excess liquid by the handful, squeeze it dry, and transfer it to another bowl, discarding the liquid. Do not rinse. Stir in the Asian pear, tossing to combine. Combine the chili powder, garlic, ginger, water, sugar, oyster sauce, and fish sauce in a food processor. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. Add to the cabbage-pear mixture, toss to combine, and let sit overnight, covered and at room temperature. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate. Wait at least a few days before using the kimchi, which will get more pungent as the days go by. Use within 2 weeks.
