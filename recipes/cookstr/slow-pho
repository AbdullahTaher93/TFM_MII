In a 4-quart slow cooker, combine the onion, chile, ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, tamari, and stock; cover, and cook on Low for 6 hours. Meanwhile or beforehand, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the seitan strips, and brown on all sides. Remove from the heat and set aside. Strain the stock and return the broth to the cooker. In a small bowl, combine the hoisin, lime juice, and miso paste mixture, then add to the broth. Stir in the drained rice sticks and seitan and cook 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until the rice sticks are soft. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the bean sprouts, scallions, and cilantro.
