Bring the quinoa, water, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook until the grains soften and appear to unravel, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large serving bowl, toss together the tomatoes, chicken, corn, mozzarella, scallions, half the basil, the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and the vinegar. Drain the quinoa using a fine-mesh strainer. Add the quinoa to the serving bowl and toss well. Season generously with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately sprinkled with the remaining basil, or serve at room temperature.
