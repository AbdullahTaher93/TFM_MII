Season the livers with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in the saut√© pan over medium heat until it foams and subsides. Add the livers to the pan and sear on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the livers and allow to cool for a few minutes. Place the livers in the blender. Return the pan to the heat and stir in the vinegar, scraping all that goodness from the bottom of the pan with the wooden spoon. Remove the pan from the heat and add the vinegar to the blender with the livers. Add the olive oil and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper as needed.
