Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and put a rack in a roasting pan. Mash and mix the ginger, minced garlic, Â¼ cup of the hoisin sauce, the oyster sauce, cilantro leaves, the white part of the scallions, and butter in a medium mixing bowl. Season the turkey both inside and out with salt and pepper. Stuff the cilantro stems and the scallion greens, the 5 cloves of garlic, and the lemon halves into the cavity of the turkey. Spread the ginger paste over the turkey and then rub the top with the remaining 1/4 cup hoisin sauce. Roast the turkey for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees and cook, basting every 20 minutes or so, for another 2 hours, or until the bird reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees. If the top gets too dark, cover the turkey with aluminum foil. Let rest before carving. Sprinkle the remaining cilantro and scallions over the bird. Serve with sweet potatoes.
