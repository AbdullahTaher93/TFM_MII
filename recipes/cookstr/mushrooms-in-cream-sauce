Place the mushrooms in a colander and rinse quickly under cold running water to clean them. Cut large mushrooms in halves or quarters. In a large frying pan, cook the bacon over medium heat until lightly browned. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Add the butter to the pan and melt. Add the onion and cook about 5 minutes, until browned. Add the mushrooms and garlic and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes until browned. Add the wine and nutmeg and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the créme fraîche and reserved bacon. Dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tbsp water. Stir into the sauce and cook until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Just before serving, stir in the tarragon.
