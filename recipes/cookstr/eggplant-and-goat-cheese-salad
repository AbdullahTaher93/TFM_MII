To make the dressing, whisk the lemon juice and garlic in a small bowl. Whisk in the walnut oil. Season with salt and pepper. Cut the eggplants into Â¾ in (2cm) cubes. Steam until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and let cool. Gently squeeze out excess water. Combine the eggplant, goat cheese, walnuts, tomato, red onion, and parsley in a large bowl with the dressing. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the sesame seeds on top. Serve at room temperature. Variation: Eggplant Salad with Feta and Pine Nuts: Replace the cheese and sesame seeds with feta and pine nuts for a change.
