Combine the flours, cornmeal, salt, pepper, and baking powder in a second medium-size bowl. Whisk to combine. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until combined, but do not over mix.

Pour the cornbread batter into the skillet and put it back in the oven. Bake for 33 to 38 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool slightly before serving.
