Cut the bacon into small pieces. Heat a skillet to medium-high and saut√© the bacon until brown. Add the peas to the pan and cook until bright green and heated through. While the peas are cooking, remove the mint leaves from their stems, bunch them all together, and slice into thin strands. Transfer the peas and bacon to a serving bowl and toss with the mint, salt, and pepper. Serve hot.
