Rinse the seaweed in a large bowl in three or four changes of cold water, swishing it around to release the salt. Cover with water and set it aside to soak for 10 minutes. Drain, and then thoroughly squeeze the seaweed between clean kitchen towels to remove all excess moisture. Return to a dry mixing bowl. Prepare the dressing: Whisk the vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and sugar together in a bowl until the crystals dissolve. Add the ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil, whisking to incorporate. When ready to serve, toss the seaweed with most of the dressing and half of the sesame seeds. Taste and add more dressing to suit your taste. Divide among six small salad bowls, sprinkle each portion of seaweed with the remaining sesame seeds, and serve immediately.
