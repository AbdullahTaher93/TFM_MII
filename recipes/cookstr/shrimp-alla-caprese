Season the shrimp with salt and pepper. In a large sauté pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat. When it is hot, add the shrimp and quickly sear on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a platter. In the same sauté pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the heat to mdium-high, add the brandy, and let it evaporate, about 30 seconds. Add the white wine and simmer until it has reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the fish stock, rosemary, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes, and bring to a simmer. Cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Return the shrimp to the sauté pan, add the lemon juice, and heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Correct the seasoning, if necessary, and remove the rosemary and oregano sprigs. Blend in the butter, ½ tablespoon at a time. Serve immediately.
