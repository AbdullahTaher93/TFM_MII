Prepare the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the salt and vinegars and whisk to blend. Slowly whisk in the oil. Season with white pepper. Taste for seasoning. Carefully wash, trim, and dry the salad greens. Tear them all into small bite-size pieces; you should have 1Â½ cup of each variety of green. Place the greens in a large salad bowl, add the herbs, and toss to blend. Slowly add the vinaigrette, tossing to evenly coat the greens. Arrange the salad in a mound on each of six salad plates. Garnish with the mint and celery leaves. Drizzle with a few drops of vinegar, and serve immediately.
