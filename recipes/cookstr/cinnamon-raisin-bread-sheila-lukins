Stir the yeast, warm water, and ¼ teaspoon sugar together in a small bowl. Let the mixture stand until the yeast starts foaming, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine the flours, the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, the cinnamon, and walnuts in a large bowl. Stir well. Stir the yeast mixture, butter, and 1/3 cup water into the flour mixture. Then stir in the raisins or work them in by hand. Let stand 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until it is smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, and turn the dough in it to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl loosely with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until it is doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. Oil a 9 × 5 × 3-inch loaf pan. Punch the dough down, and shape it into a loaf. Press it into the prepared pan and cover it loosely. Let the dough rise until it nearly fills the pan, 45 to 60 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake the bread until the top is browned and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped with your finger, 35 to 40 minutes. . Remove the bread from the pan and let it cool on a wire rack.
