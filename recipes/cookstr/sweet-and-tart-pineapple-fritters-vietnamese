Dry pineapple slices between paper towels. Prepare the batter: Stir together flour, cornstarch, sugar, and baking powder in a small bowl. Mix in water slowly until smooth. Refrigerate 20 minutes. Heat 3 inches (7.5 cm) of oil in a skillet or wok to 360°F (185°C) or until dough dropped in comes back up. Coat pineapple rings with batter and slide into oil. Cook rings 2 minutes on each side or until browned. Take out with slotted spoon and drain on a paper-lined plate. Continue cooking rings until all are cooked. Test for heat level between each batch. Serve immediately, sprinkled with wine, sugar, and sesame seeds.
