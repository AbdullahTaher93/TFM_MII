Put the cream in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan and simmer to reduce by half, about 30 to 40 minutes. While the cream is reducing, cut the zucchini into “noodles”: trim the ends off the zucchini and, using a vegetable peeler, cut each one into lengthwise strips. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Add the Parmesan and lemon zest to the reduced cream and continue to simmer while the zucchini cooks. Add the zucchini strips to the boiling water, stir a few times, and cook 2 minutes. Drain well. In a large bowl, toss with the lemon juice. Add the chives to the cream mixture and pour over the zucchini. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot or at room temperature.
