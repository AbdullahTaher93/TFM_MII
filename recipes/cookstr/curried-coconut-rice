Melt the butter in a large wide saucepan, or deep skillet. Add the onion; cook, stirring, over low heat until golden, about 15 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the curry powder, cumin, coriander, cardamom, red pepper flakes, and cinnamon; cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the rice; stir to coat with the spices, about 1 minute. Add the cauliflower, squash, green beans, lima beans, and carrots; stir to blend with the rice. Add the broth, salt, and a grinding of black pepper; heat to a boil over high heat. Stir thoroughly, making sure that all the rice is moistened. Cover and cook over low heat until the broth is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Let stand, covered, off the heat, for 10 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, combine the half-and-half or milk and coconut in a food processor. Process just until blended, about 30 seconds. Heat the cashews in a small skillet over low heat, stirring, until toasted, about 3 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop. Just before serving, pour the coconut milk over the rice and gently fold together. Spoon the rice into a serving bowl. Sprinkle with the cashews and cilantro, and serve.
