Combine the wine and sugar in a large saucepan. Heat to a boil over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean; add the seeds and the bean to the syrup. Add the figs and cinnamon sticks. Cook, covered, over mediumlow heat for 20 minutes: add the apricots and cook until the fruits are plumped and tender, about 25 minutes more. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fruit, cinnamon sticks, and vanilla bean to a heat resistant bowl. Boil the wine syrup, uncovered, until it is reduced to about 2 cups. Pour the syrup over the figs and stir to blend. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 4 hours. Eat plain or with a spoonful of créme fraîche, yogurt, or fromage blanc on top. Garnish with almonds if desired.
