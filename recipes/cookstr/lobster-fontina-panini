Preheat panini grill to high. Place rolls, cut side down, on a work surface and brush crusts with butter. Turn rolls over and evenly layer with cheese. On bottom halves, evenly layer with lobster, spinach and caramelized onions. Cover with top halves and press gently to pack. Place sandwiches in grill, close the top plate and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately. Variation: Substitute grilled shrimp or scallops for the lobster.
