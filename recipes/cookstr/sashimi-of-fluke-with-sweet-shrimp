Lay the slices of fish on a work surface. Lay 2 cilantro sprigs and 2 chive pieces on each slice and roll so that the tops of the herbs extend from one end. Stand the rolls on end on a chilled plate and arrange the shrimp along with them. Combine the fish sauce and lime juice in a small ramekin or sauce dish. Stir in chili sauce to make the sauce as spicy as you like.
