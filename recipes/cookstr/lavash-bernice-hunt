Place the yeast and water in a dishpan or large mixing bowl and stir with a wooden spoon. Add the oil, salt, sugar, and 2 cups of the flour, and beat with the spoon for a minute or two until well blended. Add 2 more cups of flour, then squeeze the mixture with your hands until the flour disappears. If it is too wet to pick up, add a little more flour. As soon as you can handle the dough, begin to knead directly in the bowl (or on a floured board), adding more flour as necessary. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Spread a little oil on the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add the ball of dough, then turn it over, oiled side up. Cover and set in a warm place for about an hour, or until the dough doubles in bulk. Punch down the risen dough and cut it into 4 equal pieces. On a floured board, roll out 2 pieces into 10-x-14- inch rectangles (or 13-inch circles). Place them on two large ungreased baking sheets. Prick the top of the dough all over with a fork. (Unless you have two ovens, you will have to bake this bread in two batches. Once the first batch is baked, roll out the remaining 2 pieces of dough and repeat the steps.) Place in a preheated 400°F oven and bake about 20 to 30 minutes, or until the surface of the lavash becomes bubbly and crisp, and the bottom is brown (you can peek with the help of a spatula). If the top isn’t very crisp, slide the pan under the broiler for just a few seconds. When doing this, keep the broiler door open, the potholder handy, and watch; lavash can turn black in a flash. Cool the lavash on a wire rack. When thoroughly cool, break into pieces and store in an airtight container, where it will keep for a few weeks.
