Set over moderately high heat. When the butter begins to, deepen in color very slightly, put in the suprêmes. Regulate heat so butter is always hot but does not turn more than a deep yellow. After 3 minutes, turn the sapremes and sauté on the other side. In two minutes, press tops of suprêmes with your finger. As soon as they are springy to the touch, they are done. Remove to a hot platter, leaving the butter in the skillet. Add additional clarified butter to skillet and set over moderately high heat until the butter has turned a very light golden brown (a minute or two). Immediately remove from heat, sir in parsley and lemon juice, and taste for seasoning. Pour over the suprêmes and serve.
