Trim the artichokes by removing the outer tough leaves and the sharp tips. Cut away any bright green bits until you get to the soft heart. Slice thinly and put in a bowl of water to which you've added about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. In a large saut√© pan over medium heat, warm the 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the onion and 1 teaspoon of the salt, and cook until the onion has softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Drain the artichoke slices and add to the pan, stir, and add about 1/2 cup of water. Simmer until softened, but not browned, adding a bit more water if needed. When the artichokes are almost done, add the peas, and cook until tender. Taste and adjust with more salt if needed, but remember the pesto will also add flavor. Put the mint, garlic, almonds, lemon zest, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small food processor and puree until smooth. (You may have to add a bit of olive oil to make it blend.) Then add all of the 1/3 cup of olive oil until the mixture is well chopped and combined. Transfer the pesto to a small bowl and add the grated cheese. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Meanwhile, check the artichoke mixture and reheat if it has gotten cold. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl and toss with the artichoke mixture. If the pesto seems very thick, add a ladleful of the reserved pasta cooking water to thin it out a bit, and then add to the pasta, tossing to mix it well. At this point, you can also add a bit more of the reserved cooking water to loosen things up and make it a bit creamier if desired. Serve topped with freshly ground black pepper.
