Preheat the broiler. Heat a large, heavy sauté pan over really high heat until it’s really hot. While the pan is heating, chop up your vegetables. Carefully pick up the red-hot pan, bring it to the cutting board, and brush the onion and peppers into the pan. Return the pan to the stove and pour in the olive oil. Give the pan a quick flick so the oil distributes over all the vegetables. Add the collard greens, black beans, and tomato and cook for about 1 minute. Add the chicken stock, cover the pan, leave it on enormously high heat, and let it sit and sizzle for a few minutes. In the meantime, cook the eggs sunny-side up, or however you want your eggs, in an ovenproof pan. (You may have to do this in batches.) When the eggs are done, transfer them to the plates, sprinkle with the cheese, and put them under the broiler until the cheese melts and bubbles and browns to your liking. (You need to act quickly so the eggs are still runny when you serve them; runny eggs are key to this dish.) Take the cover off the ranchero stuff and flip the pan a couple of times. It should be thick but not wet. If there is not enough liquid for the stuff to flip easily, add more chicken stock. If there is too much liquid, tilt the pan and pour off the extra. Spoon the ranchero stuff next to the eggs, dividing it evenly, and serve with the warm tortillas on the side.
