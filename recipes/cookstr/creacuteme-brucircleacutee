PREP Put the heavy cream in the large pot. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with the paring knife and scrape the insides into the cream. Put the empty pod in as well. Add half the granulated sugar to the cream, stir well, and bring the mixture to a boil. Place the egg yolks in the large mixing bowl and whisk in the remaining granulated sugar, continuing to whisk until the mixture is pale yellow and slightly foamy. Remove the cream mixture from the heat and slowly, gradually whisk it into the yolk mixture. Make sure to whisk constantly to prevent the hot liquid from curdling the yolks. Remove the vanilla bean pod and discard. BAKE Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Place the ramekins in the baking pan and fill the pan with water so that it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Divide the custard evenly among the ramekins and cook them in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until the top is set but still jiggly. Remove the ramekins from the oven and let cool to room temperature. The custards can be held overnight, covered with plastic in the refrigerator. SERVE Sprinkle 1 tablespoon (14 g) brown sugar over the top of each custard. Carefully run the propane torch’s flame over each custard to caramelize the sugar. Wait a minute, then serve the custards with spoons.
