FIRST Prepare the Barbecued Pork as directed in the recipe. SECOND Trim the stem ends and wilted leafy ends of the broccoli rabe and discard. If using Western broccoli, with a sharp paring knife cut away the stem ends and peel away the tough outer skin and separate the florets. Cut the broccoli stems on the diagonal into 1Â½-inch sections. THIRD Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil, drop in the broccoli, partially cook for 2 minutes, or until just tender, remove with a slotted strainer, and refresh in cold water. Drain and set aside. Bring the water back to a boil, add the noodles, stir, and cook 5 to 6 minutes, until nearly tender. Drain in a colander, rinse lightly to remove the starch, and drain again thoroughly in a colander. Put in a bowl and toss lightly with the mixed toasted sesame and olive oils. Spread the noodles out on a large baking sheet. FOURTH Heat the broiler until red-hot. Place the noodles 3 inches under the broiler and cook about 10 minutes on each side, until golden brown, flipping them over once. Turn off the broiler and keep the noodles warm in the oven. FIFTH Heat a wok or large skillet, add the 2 tablespoons oil, and heat until very hot, about 15 seconds. Add the garlic, ginger, and scallion greens and stir-fry about 30 seconds, until very fragrant. Add the Sauce and cook over medium heat until it thickens. Add the barbecued pork and cooked broccoli and toss gently in the sauce. Place the browned noodles on a deep platter or in a large pasta bowl and spoon the pork, broccoli, and sauce on top. Serve immediately.
