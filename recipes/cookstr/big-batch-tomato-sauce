In a large Dutch oven or saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrots, celery, garlic, basil, oregano, sugar, pepper and bay leaf; cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until vegetables are softened. Stir in tomatoes with juice, tomato paste and 1 tomato-paste can of water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 35 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. Remove bay leaf; stir in parsley. Let cool; pack into containers and refrigerate or freeze.
