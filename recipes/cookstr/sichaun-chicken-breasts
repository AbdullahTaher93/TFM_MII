At least 2 hours and up to the night before you plan to smoke the chicken breasts, combine all the paste ingredients in a mini food processor. Coat the chicken thoroughly with the paste. Wrap the chicken in plastic and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to the smoker and cook it until the juices run clear when a skewer is inserted into a breast, about 30 minutes at a temperature of 225° F to 250° F. Remove the chicken from the smoker and let it sit at room temperature for 5 minutes. Slice each breast and fan the pieces decoratively on individual plates. Garnish with the tangerine or orange wedges, squeezing some of the juice over the chicken before eating.
