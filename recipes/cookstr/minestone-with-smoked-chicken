Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onion, leek, and parsley and saut√© until the onions are wilted, about 10 minutes. Add half of the chicken, then the celery and carrots. Cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the Swiss chard and cabbage. Cook, stirring, until the Swiss chard and cabbage lose volume, about 5 minutes. Add the potato, zucchini, tomatoes, cannellini beans and liquid, green beans, and broth. Simmer over low heat, partially covered, for 30 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the orzo about 8 to 10 minutes, or just until tender, then drain. (If holding the pasta aside, toss with a little oil to keep it from sticking together.) Five minutes before the soup is finished, stir the orzo and remaining chicken into the soup. Season with salt and pepper to taste. This is a thick soup, but it can be thinned with additional broth if desired. Ladle the soup into individual bowls. Top with a dollop of Pesto. Serve with grated cheese on the side.
