Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook 10 minutes, until soft. Add the anchovy, garlic, and red pepper flakes to taste. Using a fork, mash the anchovy fillets until they dissolve. Add the wine, bring to a boil, and then add the stock and tomatoes and cook until the soup just begins to boil. Remove it from the heat and allow to cool enough to transfer to a food processor. Puree the tomato soup until smooth. Return it to the saucepan and stir in the olives and capers. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reheat the soup on low until warm. Serve topped with parsley and a sprinkle of Romano cheese.
