Combine all ingredients together and mix well. To apply, place a small amount in a shallow bowl and, using a spoon, sprinkle over surfaces of meat or vegetables. Be sure to only lightly sprinkle, as the flavors are strong. (Never dip your fingers into the entire amount of rub and then rub onto the meat as it will contaminate the excess.)
