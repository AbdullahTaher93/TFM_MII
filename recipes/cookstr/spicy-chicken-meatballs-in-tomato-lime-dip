In a large bowl, combine all the meatball ingredients except the oil. Mix well, then shape into golf ball-size meatballs. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the tomato sauce, lime juice, and cumin. Set the pan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Partially cover and let simmer for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the meatballs with the tomato-lime dip on the side for dunking.
