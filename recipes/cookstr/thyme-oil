In a small saucepan, bring the oil and thyme to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 1 minute. Allow to cool slightly in the pan, then transfer the thyme oil to a glass container to cool completely. Strain the oil, discarding the thyme, and transfer into another clean glass container. Cover tightly. The oil can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
