Drain the tofu, wrap it in a towel, and press while you gather the rest of the ingredients. Heat the oil and butter in a medium skillet. When hot, crumble the tofu into the pan in pieces about the size of scrambled-egg curds. Sprinkle with the turmeric, season with Â½ teaspoon salt, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until dry and firm (but not hard), for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the herbs and cheese, taste and season with salt, then season with pepper. Serve with a dash of paprika over the top.
