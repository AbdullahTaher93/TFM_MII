Prepare the dough: In a bowl, sift together the dry ingredients and work in the butter with your fingertips or with an electric mixer until the mixture is a mealy consistency. A little at a time, add the ice water until the dough sticks together. Do not over-mix. Shape into a ball, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425Â°. Prepare the filling: Peel and slice the peaches and toss with the lemon juice and sugar. Place the peaches in an ovenproof skillet or shallow baking pan. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to fit the pan. Place the dough over the peaches. Dust with sugar. Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm, with heavy cream or vanilla ice cream.
