Put the potatoes in a large saucepan and add enough cold water to cover by an inch or two. Add about a teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium high and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork or small knife. Drain. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the potatoes on low to medium speed. While they are mixing, add the sour cream, butter, and oil. Stop the machine to scrape down the sides of the bowl several times. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with desired toppings. Serve immediately while still hot. Topping Ideas: Snipped fresh chives Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves Crumbled crispy bacon Saut√©ed onions or shallots
