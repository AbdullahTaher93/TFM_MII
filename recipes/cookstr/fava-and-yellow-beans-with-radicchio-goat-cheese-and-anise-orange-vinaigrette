To make the vinaigrette: In a bowl, mix together the shallot and orange zest. Add the orange juice, honey, vinegar, star anise, and Sambuca. Slowly whisk in the olive oil to emulsify. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If using within 3 or 4 hours, stir in the basil and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours. Otherwise, cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Stir the basil into the vinaigrette an hour or so before serving. To make the beans: In a large pot of lightly salted water, blanch the fava beans for 3 to 6 minutes or until tender. Drain and immediately submerge in ice-cold water. Drain again. Dry on paper towels. In another large pot of lightly salted water, blanch the yellow beans for 2 to 3 minutes or until tender. Drain and immediately submerge in ice cold water. Drain again. Dry on paper towels. In a large bowl, toss together the radicchio, fava, and yellow beans. Add as much vinaigrette as needed (probably about 1 cup) and season to taste with salt and pepper. Reserve the remaining vinaigrette for a later use. Divide the salad among 4 serving plates. Top each serving with goat cheese and serve immediately.
