Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Coat a baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Combine the mustard and honey in a shallow dish. Spread the bread crumbs in another dish. Dip each breast in the mustard to coat on both sides. Dip both sides of each breast in the crumbs, patting them to make them adhere. Set aside on a plate. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the oil is very hot but not smoking. Add 2 chicken breasts and cook until the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn and brown the other sides, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and breasts. Bake the breasts on the baking sheet until they feel firm when pressed in the centers, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.
