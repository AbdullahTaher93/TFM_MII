Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Arrange the bones in 1 layer in a large roasting pan or 2 smaller pans and roast 45 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and roast, turning every 10 minutes or so, until the bones and vegetables are golden brown, another 30 to 45 minutes. With a large spoon or tongs, transfer the bones and vegetables to a stockpot. Pour off any fat from the roasting pan, add 2 to 3 cups water to the pan, and scrape up browned particles from the bottom. Pour the liquid into the stockpot over the bones and vegetables and add water as needed to cover them by 3 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat; then reduce the heat to medium and simmer 4 to 5 hours, skimming frequently. When done, the stock will have full flavor and color. Strain through a fine sieve into a large pot and reduce over high heat until 2 quarts remain. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until the fat solidifies, and lift it off the soup. Refrigerate up to 1 week. After 3 days, bring to a boil. Then boil, skim, and cool every 2 days; or freeze. Variation: For lamb or beef stock, substitute lamb or beef bones.
