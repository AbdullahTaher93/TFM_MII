Lightly oil 2 rimmed baking sheets. In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast and the pinch of sugar over the warm water. Stir to dissolve and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the 2 tablespoons sugar, the salt, and 1 cup of the flour; beat well with a wooden spoon or a heavy-duty electric mixer. Add 3 of the eggs, one at a time, and beat until smooth. Beat in the olive oil or butter and gradually add enough of the remaining 2½ cups flour to make a soft dough. Turn out on a floured board. Knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1½ hours. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead lightly until smooth, 1 or 2 minutes, and divide in half. Roll out each piece into a rectangle about 10 by 16 inches. In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg and blend in the cheeses and herbs. Spread half of the cheese filling evenly over each dough rectangle. Roll each up firmly, starting from a long side. Place one loaf on each of the prepared pans, seam side down. With clean scissors, snip each loaf at 1¼-inch intervals, cutting three-fourths of the way through the dough. Pull and twist each cut piece to lie flat on an alternate side. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1½ hours. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake the loaves for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when thumped. Let cool on the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer from the pans to wire racks. Serve warm or at room temperature, cut into slices.
