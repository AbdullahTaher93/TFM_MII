Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and saut√© until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, remove from the heat, and set aside in the skillet. In a small saucepan, combine the orange juice, Grand Marnier, garlic, and raisins and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, stir in the tomato paste, mustard, sugar, and water, and simmer for 5 minutes or until slightly syrupy. Stir in the cornstarch mixture, stirring to thicken, about 1 minute. Add the lemon juice. Pour the sauce over the tofu and simmer until the tofu is heated through and glazed with sauce, about 5 minutes. Serve over the hot rice.
