Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Separate the pita into 2 rounds and bake on a cookie sheet for about 5 minutes or until very crisp but not browned. Set aside. Put the tomato, red onion, peppers, cucumber, radishes, and scallions into a large salad bowl. Add the romaine or purslane and the fresh mint and sprinkle over the dried mint. Toss with your hands. To make the dressing, whisk together the garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, pomegranate syrup, and salt and pepper in a small bowl. Just before serving, give the dressing another quick whisk and then pour it over the vegetables and work it in with your hands. Break the pita halves into roughly 1-inch pieces and, at the last moment before taking the bowl to the table, sprinkle with some of the sumac and toss the pita gently into the salad. Taste, add more sumac or other seasonings if you want, and serve right away; otherwise the pita chips will get soggy.
