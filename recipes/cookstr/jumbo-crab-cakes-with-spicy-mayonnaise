2â€“3 Minutes Place the bread, parsley, and scallions in a food processor or blender and process until the mixture is fine, 30 seconds. Add 2 tablespoons of the mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon of the mustard, and the Worcestershire sauce and egg and process just until combined, 10 seconds more. Transfer this mixture to a bowl. Pick over the crabmeat, then separate it carefully with a fork. Gently fold it into the parsley and mayonnaise mixture. Divide the crab mixture into 6 even portions and form these into cakes about 1-inch thick. Place the cakes on a large plate. Pour the oil into a large deep skillet and heat over medium-high heat. When it is hot, gently slide the crab cakes into the oil and fry until they are deep brown on one side, 1 minute. Turn the cakes with a metal spatula and fry on the other side until deep brown, 1 minute longer. Transfer the crab cakes to paper towels to drain. Meanwhile, place the remaining 1/3 cup of mayonnaise and 2 teaspoons of mustard in a small bowl and stir to combine. Stir in hot pepper sauce to taste. To serve, place the crab cakes on plates and spoon some of the mustard sauce over each. Serve with lemon wedges.
