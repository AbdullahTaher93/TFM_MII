Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Divide the sweet potatoes, parsnips, and carrots in two roasting pans. Sprinkle the vegetables with the thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper, and olive oil, tossing to coat. Roast the vegetables for about 45 to 50 minutes, until they are lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. In a large bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, sherry vinegar, and chicken stock. Add the roasted vegetables and toss them with the liquid to coat. Transfer the vegetables to a platter and serve.
