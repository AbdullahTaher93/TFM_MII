In a large bowl, combine the sugar, 3 tablespoons of the shortening, and the peppermint and vanilla extracts. Add the Lyle’s Golden Syrup and mix thoroughly with a large spoon. With a very small ice cream scoop or tablespoon measure, scoop out the dough and roll it into balls. Place on a wax paper-lined baking sheet and chill for 30 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and press the balls with the bottom of a glass to form ¼-inch-thick patties. Return the patties to the baking sheet and chill for another 30 minutes. After the patties have chilled, combine the chocolate and the remaining 2 tablespoons of shortening in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted. Allow the chocolate mixture to cool for 10 minutes. Dip the patties in the chocolate mixture so they are completely coated, then place the patties on wax paper lined baking sheets. Place the baking sheets in the refrigerator and let the peppermint patties dry for at least an hour before serving. Store the completely dried patties, covered and refrigerated, for up to 1 week.
