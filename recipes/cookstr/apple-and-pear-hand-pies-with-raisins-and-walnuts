When you make the pastry, divide the dough into 4 equal-size balls. Flatten the balls into ½-inch-thick disks and wrap the disks in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until fairly firm, 1 to 1½ hours, but not overly so, or it will be difficult to roll. To make the filling, put the raisins, walnuts, brown sugar, coconut, and cinnamon in a food processor and pulse repeatedly, until the nuts are finely chopped-but not too finely; you want some larger pieces, too. Transfer to a medium-size mixing bowl and add the apple, pear, and lemon juice. Mix well and set aside. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll it into an 8-inch circle on a sheet of lightly floured waxed paper with a floured rolling pin. Spoon about one-quarter of the filling over half of the dough, leaving a ¾-inch border along the edge. Moisten the edge of the pastry with a finger, then fold the empty half over the filling. Fold up the border and pinch the edges together, rolling them between your fingers into a son of rope edge. Place the turnover on a large, lightly buttered baking sheet. Refrigerate while you make the remaining hand pies, putting each on the sheet as it is assembled. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the sheet from the refrigerator and brush each hand pie with a little milk. Sprinkle them with granulated sugar, then poke the surface 2 or 3 times with a fork to make steam vents. Place on the center oven rack and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 20 minutes longer, until golden brown. You may see steam coming from the vents. Transfer the pies to a cooling rack and let cool slightly. While they’re still warm, dust them with a little confectioners’ sugar, if you like. I just put a tablespoon or two of sugar in a sieve and shake it right over the pies. I think these are best eaten warm.
