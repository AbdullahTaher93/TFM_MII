Cut 4 heart-shaped pieces of baking parchment large enough for the salmon to fit on one half. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). For each fillet, brush a parchment heart with olive oil. Place 1 sliced tomato on one half of the heart. Top with 1 salmon fillet, 2 lemon slices, 2 tarragon sprigs, and season with salt and pepper. Fold the heart over to enclose the fish and vegetables. Tightly crimp the edges to create a tight seal. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Place the parcels on a baking sheet. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the paper browns. Place the salmon parcels on dinner plates. Serve immediately, with scissors so each guest can open their packet. Good with Beurre Blanc (a classic butter sauce) poured over the fish or served alongside.
