Preheat the oven to 350°F. Oil and flour a 9-inch spring-form pan and set aside. Sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Place the tofu, oil, maple syrup, orange juice, vanilla and orange extracts, and orange peel in a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth. Add to the flour mixture and stir well. Fold the poppy seeds into the batter and pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes before removing the sides of the pan, then allow the cake to cool completely. To prepare the filling, combine the orange juice and agar flakes in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the agar is completely dissolved. Place the tofu, maple syrup, orange peel, and vanilla in a blender or food processor, and blend until very smooth and creamy. Add to the saucepan with the agar mixture and simmer, stirring constantly for 5 minutes. To Make the Orange Glaze: Place the orange juice in a small saucepan, add the arrow-root, and stir to dissolve. Add the brown rice syrup, and bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Cool slightly before using. Variations: • Depending on the type of cake you want to glaze, you can use other varieties of juice for this recipe. Apple, pineapple, and cranberry juice are popular choices.
