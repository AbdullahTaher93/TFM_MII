Remove the seeds from the cardamom and discard the pods. Break the cinnamon stick into small pieces. Put the cardamom seeds, cinnamon pieces, cumin seeds, whole cloves, and black peppercorns in a small flying pan. Dry-fry for 1â€“2 minutes, or until fragrant. Set aside and cool. Put in a food processor or spice mill with the nutmeg and blend until finely ground. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
