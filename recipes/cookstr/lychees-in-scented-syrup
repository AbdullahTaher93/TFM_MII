Bring 2/3 cup water, the sugar, lime juice, and star anise to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat to high and boil for 7 minutes, until syrupy. Let cool. Meanwhile, peel the lychees and remove the pits, if desired. Place in a serving bowl. Add the ginger and its syrup. Pour the syrup over the lychees. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until well chilled. The star anise can be served with the lychees as a decoration, but it cannot be eaten. Variation Strawberries in Scented Syrup Substitute quartered or halved strawberries for the lychees.
