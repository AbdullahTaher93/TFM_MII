Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cream, milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, and salt. Soak the bread in the mixture for about 20 minutes. Grease a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish with the butter. Pour the bread and custard mixture into the dish. Bake until the pudding slightly puffs up and the edges turn a golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes To make the sauce, in a wok over medium-high heat, combine the brown sugar, cream, butter, and salt, stirring with a wooden spoon, until it just comes to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and continue stirring until the sauce thickens, about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the bourbon and remove the sauce from the heat. Spoon the sauce generously over each dish of warm bread pudding and serve.
