Prepare for water-bath canning: Wash the jars and keep them hot in the canning pot, and put the flat lids in a heatproof bowl (see Notes for details). In a wide saucepan, bring 2 inches water to a boil, then add the asparagus; bring back to a boil, then immediately drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool. Drain well. In a nonreactive pot, combine the vinegar, 1 cup water, the salt, and sugar. Bring to a boil. Ladle boiling water from the canning pot into the bowl with the lids. Using a jar lifter, remove the hot jars from the canning pot, carefully pouring the water from each one back into the pot, and place them upright on a folded towel. Drain the water off the jar lids. Divide the asparagus, pickling spice, and garlic cloves between the hot jars. Ladle the hot vinegar mixture into the jars, leaving l/2 inch headspace at the top. Use a chopstick to remove air bubbles around the inside of each jar. Use a damp paper towel to wipe the rims of the jars, then put a flat lid and ring on each jar, adjusting the ring so that it's just finger-tight. Return the jars to the water in the canning pot, making sure the water covers the jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil, and boil for 10 minutes to process. Remove the jars to a folded towel and do not disturb for 12 hours. After 1 hour, check that the lids have sealed by pressing down on the center of each; if it can be pushed down, it hasn't sealed, and the jar should be refrigerated immediately. Label the sealed jars and store.
