Pick the buds when they are about the size of small capers. Wipe the nasturtium buds clean with a kitchen towel, rubbing the surface gently to make sure they are free of grit and soil. Place the buds in a glass jar. Cover them completely in coarse salt. Let rest for 2 to 3 hours. Remove the nasturtium buds from the salt and wipe them free of salt and moisture. Place them along with a few peppercorns in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid and store in the pantry.
