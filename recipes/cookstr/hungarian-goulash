Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. Add the beef in batches, and cook for about 5 minutes, turning occasionally, until browned. Add the remaining oil to the casserole and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, peppers, and garlic, and cook, scraping up the bits in the casserole, about 5 minutes, until the onions are transparent. Add the paprika and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and tomato paste. Dissolve the flour in ¼ cup of the stock, then stir into the casserole with the remaining stock and thyme, and season to taste. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Cover tightly. Bake for 2 hours, or until the beef is tender. To serve, spoon the goulash into individual bowls. Top each with a generous dollop of sour cream and sprinkle with a little paprika. Variation With Potato Dumplings Combine 2 cups of mashed potatoes with 1 beaten egg, 3 tbsp all-purpose flour, 3 tbsp semolina (pasta) flour, and ½ tsp caraway seeds. The mixture should hold its shape; if not, add flour. Shape into 12 balls and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Cook for 15 minutes in a pot of simmering water, until fluffy.
