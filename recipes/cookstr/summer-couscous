Place the couscous in a medium bowl; add the boiling water; cover and let stand until all the water is absorbed and mixture has cooled slightly, about 20 minutes. Add the finely chopped vegetables. In a small bowl, whisk the oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add to the salad; toss to blend.
