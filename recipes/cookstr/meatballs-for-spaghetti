Blend all the ingredients well and roll firmly into tiny balls about 1Â½ inches in diameter. Heat 4 to 5 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy skillet and add the meatballs. Roll them around well, by shaking the pan, to keep their shape. When they are nicely browned on all sides, drop them into tomato sauce or tomato meat sauce and let them simmer 20 minutes before serving with pasta and sauce and large amounts of freshly grated Parmesan, Romano, or Asiago cheese.
