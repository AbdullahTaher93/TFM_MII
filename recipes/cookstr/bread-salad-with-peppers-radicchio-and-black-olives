Heat the oven to 350°F. Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes. Arrange the cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast until the bread is dried out allover, about 10 minutes. Raise the oven temperature to 450°F. Put the bread cubes in a large bowl and sprinkle 1 or 2 tablespoons warm water on top. Toss and lightly rub the bread cubes with your hands until they are evenly moist allover. Add a few more teaspoons warm water if necessary, but do not add so much water that you can squeeze it out of the bread. Set aside. Put the peppers on a rimmed baking sheet and roast in the hot oven, turning them over once or twice, until their skins are blistered, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a bowl and tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes before uncovering. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, use a paring knife to remove and discard their skins and seeds. Do not rinse the peppers, or you will wash away some of the roasted flavor. Cut the peppers into 1-inch pieces and set aside. While the peppers are roasting, cut the tomatoes in half and remove and discard the cores and seeds. Cut them into ½-inch cubes. Peel, halve, and seed the cucumber. Cut crosswise at a slant into ¼-inch slices. Cut the radicchio in half and cut out the core. Slice each half crosswise into thin strips. In a large bowl, combine the bread, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, radicchio, capers, and olives. Toss together until well combined. In a small bowl, whisk together the anchovies, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil, and pour over the bread mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste and mix well. Let the salad stand at room temperature for at least 3 hours, or refrigerate it overnight to allow the flavors to intensify. If refrigerated, let the salad stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving. Immediately before serving, tear the basil leaves into 1-inch pieces and add them to the salad.
