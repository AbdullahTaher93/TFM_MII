Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix cherry tomatoes, sundried tomatoes, garlic, and olive together. Add chilli flakes to taste, salt and pepper, and a generous dousing of olive oil. Roast for around 30 minutes, until tomatoes are turning brown and wrinkled. Sandwich two filets of fish with 1/4 cup pesto each, season with salt and pepper. Wrap each sandwich with prosciutto, tucking in the ends. Place fish on partroasted tomatoes, and continue to cook, uncovered, for a further 20/25 minutes.
