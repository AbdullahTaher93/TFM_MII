Mix ½ gallon water with ¾ cup salt, stirring for salt to dissolve. Soak cucumbers in salt water about 30 minutes. (Be careful not to soak too long.) Remove cucumbers and rinse. Cut about ¼ inch from each end of cucumbers. Cut cucumbers in half in middle, not lengthwise. Hold cucumber facing circular middle. Cut in half lengthwise, leaving about ½ inch at end uncut. Cut in half lengthwise again, perpendicular to your first cut, leaving the end uncut. You should have 4 semiequal parts of cucumber, cut but still attached. Repeat with remaining cucumbers. Place garlic in a food processor or blender and mince. Combine onion, green onions, buchu, garlic, chili powder, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon optional sugar in large bowl. (If mixing with your hands, be sure to wear gloves to avoid chili burn.) Set three 1-quart jars on work surface. Using your fingers, separate cucumber quarters and stuff mixture into cucumbers. Divide evenly among jars, pressing cucumbers down firmly into jars. Stir 1 teaspoon sugar into 1/3 cup water until sugar is completely dissolved. Pour sugar water over cucumbers. Let sit 1 day before serving. Refrigerate after opening.
