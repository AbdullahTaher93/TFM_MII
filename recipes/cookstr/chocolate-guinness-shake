Place the Guinness, vanilla extract, ice cream, and sorbet in a blender and pulse several times to begin breaking up the ice cream and sorbet. With the blender motor off, use a flexible spatula to mash the mixture down onto the blender blades. Continue pulsing, stopping, and mashing until the mixture is well blended, thick, and moves easily in the blender jar, roughly 30 to 90 seconds. Pour into a chilled glass or glasses, and serve at once. Molasses Variation: Follow the recipe for the Chocolate-Guinness Shake, adding 1 tablespoon of molasses (about ½ ounce/22 grams) to the blender along with the other ingredients. Malted Variation: Follow the recipe for the Chocolate-Guinness Shake, adding 1 tablespoon of malted milk powder (about ½ ounce/15 grams) to the blender with the Guinness and the vanilla extract, and blending for a moment before adding the ice cream and sorbet. Espresso Variation: Follow the recipe for the Chocolate-Guinness Shake, adding 1 shot of room temperature espresso (about 2 tablespoons/1 ounce/30 milliliters) to the blender along with the other ingredients.
