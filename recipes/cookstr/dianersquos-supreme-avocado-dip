Mash the avocados and lime juice in a medium bowl until smooth. Season lightly with salt (the next layer is salty and will season the avocados). Spread the avocados in a thick layer on a round or oval platter. Stir the sour cream, mayonnaise, and dressing mix in a small bowl, blending well. Spread over the avocados, being sure to cover them completely. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. (The dip can be prepared to this point up to 5 hours ahead.) Just before serving, arrange a ring of the tomatoes around the edge of the dip. Make progressively smaller rings of the scallions, cheese, olives, and jalapenos, on the dip, ending with the cilantro in the center. Serve immediately.
