Melt the butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the shrimp, garlic, and chilies and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the mint, scallions, rum, lime juice, and salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the shrimp are done, about 1 minute. Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a serving dish. Boil the sauce over high heat until thick and syrupy, 2 to 3 minutes. Correct the seasonings, adding salt or lime juice to taste. Pour the sauce over the shrimp and serve at once.
