Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Place the undrained tomatoes in a blender container. Blend until smooth. Transfer to a saucepan, adding enough water to blended mixture to equal 3 cups. Add bay leaf to saucepan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Heat oil in an ovenproof 2-quart saucepan until hot. Add onion, chile peppers, bell pepper, garlic, turmeric, and cumin. Cook and stir until the liquid has evaporated. Add rice, scraping the bottom with a large spatula to prevent burning. Add the tomato liquid and beans. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat. Transfer saucepan to oven. Bake, covered, until rice is done, about 20 minutes. Remove bay leaf. Stir in cilantro.
