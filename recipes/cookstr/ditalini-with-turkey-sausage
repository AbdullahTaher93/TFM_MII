Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain and set aside. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, broth, and oregano and bring to a simmer. Partially cover the pan and simmer until the sausage is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the pasta and stir to combine. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil. Sprinkle with the Parmesan just before serving.
