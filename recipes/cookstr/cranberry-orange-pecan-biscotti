Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a 12 x 17-inch baking sheet with baking parchment cut to fit. In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, applesauce, margarine, and vanilla. Stir the wet mixture into the dry mixture, along with the orange zest, pecans, and cranberries. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. With floured hands, shape the dough into one 6-inch-wide “log,” about ¾-inch thick, with the ends squared off. Place this log on the lined baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven to a cooling rack and reduce the oven heat to 300°F. Cool the log on the rack for 15 minutes. Cut the log carefully with a sharp knife straight across into ½-inch-wide slices. Place the slices cut-side-down on the baking sheet (you can re-use the parchment). Bake the slices for 10 minutes or until just golden on the bottom. Turn the slices over and bake 10 minutes longer or until golden on the bottom. Transfer the biscotti to cooling racks. Store the biscotti in an airtight container for up to two weeks (or freeze them in tightly-sealed rigid freezer containers).
