Preheat a comal (Mexican flat griddle), tapa, or griddle to medium heat. Brush some of the butter lightly in the shape of half a tortilla on one side of the comal. Place the tortilla on the butter. Place the cheese on the buttered half of the tortilla, allowing Â½-inch margin around the edge of the tortilla. Scatter the jalapeno slices and any other fillings over the cheese. When the cheese starts to melt, fold the other half of the tortilla over the fillings and lightly press until the edges hold together. Brush the top with more of the butter. Flip the quesadilla by gently placing a pancake turner under the curved edges of the quesadilla and rolling it over. Cook until browned. Remove from the heat, slice into 4 or more sections, and garnish as desired. Serve warm.
