In a heavy-bottomed, 4-quart / 4-L sauté pan over medium-high heat, warm the ghee. Add the cumin seeds and cook for 40 seconds, until the cumin seeds sizzle and turn reddish-brown. Add the onion and the pinch of salt to the sauté pan and cook for 1 minute, until the onion has slightly browned and is opaque. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 4 minutes, until the mixture is browned. You’ll want to be sure to mix this as it cooks so that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan. If it starts to stick, just add a little water about a teaspoon at a time. You don’t want to add too much. Add the potatoes to the sauté pan and cook, stirring well, for 2 minutes, until cooked through. Add the turmeric, Garam Masala, and red chile powder. Stir well and cook for 1 minute. Add the spinach, the remaining 1½ teaspoons of salt, and the fresh chiles to the sauté pan. Stir well and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. If the vegetables start to stick to the pan, add the water. Raise the heat to high and cook for 2 minutes to remove any excess moisture. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are soft. Remove from the heat. Stir well. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately with the brown or white basmati rice, Roti, or Naan.
