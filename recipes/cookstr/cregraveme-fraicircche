Pour the heavy cream into a stainless steel bowl or large glass measuring cup. In a smaller cup or bowl, thin the sour cream with a little of the cream, then stir into the remaining cream. Pour the mixture into a clean glass jar; and cover loosely, Let it thicken to the consistency of thin sour cream at room temperature for anywhere from 4 to 12 hours, depending on the warmth of the room. Cover the jar tightly and refrigerate. The creme fraiche will thicken to the consistency of sour cream when thoroughly chilled.
