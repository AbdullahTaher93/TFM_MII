First, make the sauce. In a food processor, mince the garlic and parsley. Add the tofu, and puree. Scrape down the sides and keep processing until it is completely smooth. Add the lemon juice, dill, and salt, scrape down, and process to mix. Pour the olive oil slowly through the tube with the motor running. Scrape the tofu sauce into a bowl and reserve, then wash the processor bowl, and dry it well. Break the brown rice cakes into pieces and put into the food processor bowl. Pulse to break the pieces into rice-size bits. Transfer the rice cake bits to a pie pan or plate. In another pie pan, whisk the egg and Dijon mustard. Heat a large, nonstick skillet on high for a few seconds, then pour in the oil. Heat the oil until it shimmers. Coat the halibut fillets in the egg mixture, then in the rice cake bits, and put them in the hot pan. After the pan returns to a sizzle, reduce the heat to medium. Cook for about 5 minutes per side for thick fillets, less for thinner ones. Serve hot, with the sauce in little bowls for dipping.
