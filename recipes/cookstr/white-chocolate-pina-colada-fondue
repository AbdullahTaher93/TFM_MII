Combine the cream of coconut, rum, and chopped white chocolate in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on LOW for 1 to 2 hours. Stir until the fondue is smooth, then stir in the coconut, if using. You can serve the fondue immediately, keep it warm on LOW for an hour or so, or let it cool, uncovered, and store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 4 hours. Reheat it before you are ready to serve, letting it warm on LOW for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
