Separate and wash the greens in cold water, then spin dry. Cut off the extremities: the harshly bitter green tips and the woody white bottom ends. Coarsely chop the remaining greens into manageable lengths. Chop the anchovies, capers, and garlic into a near paste. (Roughly chop each one, then combine and work over the pile with your knife.) Transfer the paste to a bowl, add the olive oil, lemon juice, and white pepper to taste, and whisk together. Taste and add more lemon juice if needed, then stir in the parsley and cheese. Toss the puntarelle with the dressing and divide the salad among serving plates. Scatter with the grated cheese. Offer black pepper and additional cheese at the table.
