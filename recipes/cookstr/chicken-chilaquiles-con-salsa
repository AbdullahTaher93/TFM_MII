Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 2-quart baking dish—8 × 8-inch, 9-inch round, or 10-inch oblong—with nonstick oil spray. Cut the tortillas into sixths and place in the dish in an even layer. Shred the chicken and arrange over the tortillas. Top with the salsa, broth, and cheese. Add 4 teaspoons sour cream, if desired, and bake until bubbly and heated through. Serve hot. Garnish each serving with a dollop of sour cream, if desired. 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 2-quart baking dish—8 × 8-inch, 9-inch round, or 10-inch oblong—with nonstick oil spray.
