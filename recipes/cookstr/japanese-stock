Rinse off the mushrooms quickly. In a small pot, combine the mushrooms, scallions, carrots, 3 cups water, and ¼ teaspoon of the salt. Cover and simmer gently on a low flame for 30 minutes. Wipe the kombu lightly with a damp cloth and put into the pot. Simmer for 1 minute. Turn off the heat and strain the stock immediately through three layers of cheesecloth. Add the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, soy sauce, sugar, mirin, and sesame oil to the stock. Stir to mix.
