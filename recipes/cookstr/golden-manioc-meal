In a large, heavy skillet, toast the manioc meal over low heat, stirring constantly, until it begins to turn a pale beige. Remove from the heat. In a medium-size saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the toasted manioc meal slowly, stirring so that it doesnâ€™t burn, and cook until all of the butter is absorbed and there are no clumps. Remove from the heat. Peel the eggs, cut in half lengthwise, and remove the yolks. Chop the whites and set aside. Finely chop the yolks and add to the farofa. Season with salt to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and decorate with the egg whites and olives. To Serve: Serve with feijoada, fowl, fish, or barbecued meat.
