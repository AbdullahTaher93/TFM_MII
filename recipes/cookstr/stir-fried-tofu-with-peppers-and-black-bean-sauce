After preparing the vegetables, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes. Heat the sunflower oil in a large wok and cook the tofu on a medium-high heat until golden brown on all sides. Set aside to drain on paper towels. Add the peppers, peas, and scallions to the wok and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the garlic and ginger root and cook for 1 further minute. Finally add the hoisin sauce, black bean sauce or fermented black beans, chile paste, if using, Chinese wine or alternative and 3 tablespoons water. Cook briefly, then add the tofu, turning the heat down to low. Mix all the ingredients together, cooking the sauce further until thick, and serve.
