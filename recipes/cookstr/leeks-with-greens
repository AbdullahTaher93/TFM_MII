Slice the leeks finely and give them a good rinse to get rid of any grit. Heat the butter in a large frying pan or wide saucepan and add the leeks with a pinch of salt. Let them cook gently for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring or shaking the pan occasionally, until wilted and tender. Meanwhile, trim and coarsely shred the cabbage, greens, or kale. Cook lightly - in either a steamer or a large saucepan of salted water - for 3 to 4 minutes, until wilted and tender but not too soft. Remove from the heat immediately, drain well, and let the excess moisture steam off for a minute or so. Then add to the pan of buttery leeks, along with some more seasoning, and stir over a low heat for about a minute until thoroughly combined. Serve right away.
