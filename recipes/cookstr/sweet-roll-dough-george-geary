In a small bowl, whisk water, yeast and sugar until dissolved. Let stand until it starts to foam, about 5 minutes. In mixer bowl, whisk together pudding mix, milk, butter and egg. Stir in yeast mixture. Place on mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Add 3 cups (750 mL) of the flour and salt to bowl on top of liquid. Beat on low speed until dough starts to clean sides of bowl, adding up to 1 cup (250 mL) additional flour to make a soft, not sticky dough. Increase speed to medium and knead dough for 2 minutes. Remove dough from mixer bowl and turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead by hand until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a very large oiled bowl, turning to coat dough with oil. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 30 to 40 minutes. Punch down dough. Proceed as directed in recipe. After shaping, any of these breakfast yeast breads can be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours prior to baking them. If you are going to need more time, freeze shaped rolls for up to 1 month.
