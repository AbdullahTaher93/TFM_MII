Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil over high heat. Add the pasta, stir and cook according to the package instructions, until al dente. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes, until crispy. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Beat the eggs, Parmesan, and Romano together and season with pepper. Drain the pasta well and return to its saucepan. Add the egg mixture and the contents of the pan with the pancetta, including the fat, and mix quickly until the pasta is well coated. Serve immediately, with extra Romano passed on the side.
