Peel the sweet potatoes and grate them with the shredding disk in a food processor. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sweet potatoes and stir-fry for about 30 seconds just to get them cooking. Add the orange juice and peel. Cover the skillet and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Stir the potatoes every now and then to make sure they’re not sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar if you like the potatoes sweeter; sauté uncovered until the potatoes begin to get a little crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and swirl in the butter if using. Season well with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
