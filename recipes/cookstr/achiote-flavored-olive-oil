In a small saucepan, warm the oil over low heat. Add the achiote seeds and the chile, if using. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until the oil turns a rich orange color. Remove the oil from the heat and let it cool. Pour the oil through a strainer into a small jar. Discard the seeds and chile.
