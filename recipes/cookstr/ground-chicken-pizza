Preheat oven to 500째F (260째C) In a large skillet, heat half the oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook for 5 minutes, breaking it up with a spoon. Add mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes. Add green pepper and cook for 1 minute. Brush pizza crust with some of the remaining oil; sprinkle with half the cheese. Stir herb seasoning into the sauce; spread over top of the cheese. Arrange chicken mixture on top and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Drizzle with remaining oil. Bake pizza in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until crust is golden brown. To freeze: Let pizza cool. Wrap well with plastic wrap, then overwrap in heavy foil. Freeze for up to 6 weeks. To serve: Thaw in refrigerator overnight. To re-heat, bake thawed, uncovered pizza on baking sheet at 350째F (180째C) for about 20 minutes or until heated through. From Rose Murray: Quick Chicken
