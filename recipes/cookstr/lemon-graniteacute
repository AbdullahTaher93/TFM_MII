Boil the sugar and water together for 5 minutes to make a simple syrup. Cool completely, then mix in the lemon juice—the amount depends on how tart you like your granité. Pour into ice trays. Freeze until about 1 inch of the mixture has frozen around the sides of the trays, then remove; turn the mixture into a bowl and beat until smooth. Return to the trays and freeze until firm. For a more delicate ice, beat the mixture twice, freezing between beatings until just solid around the edges. Serve in sherbet glasses. Variation COFFEE GRANITE. Combine 8 tablespoons Italian-roast coffee, ground for espresso (or instant espresso), 2 to 4 teaspoons sugar to taste (according to how sweet you like your granité), and 4 cups boiling water in a glass or pottery coffee maker. Leave to steep for 30 to 40 minutes. Cool completely, then pour into ice trays (if you use coffee ground for drip pots, strain it through a paper filter cone to remove the grounds). Freeze, beating twice. Serve in sherbet glasses topped, if you wish, with a spoonful of whipped cream.
