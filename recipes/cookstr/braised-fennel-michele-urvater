Trim and discard the feathery tops from the fennel. Cut each bulb in half from top to bottom and cut out the triangular core. Slice each half crosswise, about ½ inch thick. Cut each tomato in half and remove the seeds with a spoon; finely chop the flesh. Mince the parsley. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until sizzling. Add the fennel and tomatoes; Sauté for a minute or so to coat with the oil. Add the tarragon, broth, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and simmer until the fennel is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the lid from the skillet. Add the parsley. If there is too much liquid in the skillet, boil it away over medium-high heat until most of it evaporates. Adjust the seasoning and serve hot.
