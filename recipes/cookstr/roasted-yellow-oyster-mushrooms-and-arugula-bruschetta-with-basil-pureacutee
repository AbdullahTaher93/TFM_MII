For the Brushcetta: Preheat a charcoal or gas grill to hot. Brush both sides of the bread with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill them on the cooler part of the grill until golden brown in the center and slightly burnt around the edges. They may not color evenly, but that is fine. Place the bruschetta on serving plates. Divide the topping evenly among them. For the Topping: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Trim the mushrooms, leaving just enough of the central stem attached to hold the mushrooms together. Break or cut the oyster mushrooms into clumps of 2 or 3 mushrooms each. (Cut the hen of the woods mushrooms into 1½-inch-wide strips.) Toss the mushrooms with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Spread in an even layer on a baking sheet. Roast until the mushrooms are lightly browned and tender, about 8 minutes. Keep warm. Stir the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste in a mixing bowl. If the arugula leaves are longer than 2 inches, cut them into 1-inch strips. Tender baby leaves may be left whole. Add the arugula to the dressing and toss to coat. Spread the bruschettas with the Basil Purée and arrange the prosciutto slices on top. Top with the warm mushrooms and arrange the dressed arugula over the mushrooms. Serve immediately.
