For the Steaks: Place the steaks in a single layer in a large glass or ceramic baking dish. Whisk the remaining ingredients together in a bowl and pour over the steaks, turning to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours, turning occasionally. Preheat the grill or heat a griddle pan over high heat. Remove the steaks from the marinade, shaking off the excess, and grill 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until done to taste. Transfer to a platter and let the steaks rest, loosely covered with foil, for 5 minutes, for the juices to settle. Serve with the chile lime sauce. For the Chile Lime Sauce: Combine all of the ingredients in a mini chopper or a blender, or use a mortar and pestle. Blend or grind until a paste is formed.
