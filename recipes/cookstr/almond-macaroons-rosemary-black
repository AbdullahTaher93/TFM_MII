Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a food processor, grind the 1 pound of almonds. Measure the almonds: you need about 3 cups. If you don’t have 3 cups after grinding the almonds, process another cup of almonds in the food processor and add to the ground almond mixture. Combine the sugar and the almonds in the food processor and process until the almonds are very finely ground. Remove to a large bowl. Add the egg whites, almond extract, and vanilla. Mix well with your hands. Form cookies on the prepared baking sheets, using a heaping teaspoon for each one and leaving about 1½ inches of space between each cookie. If desired, place 1 whole blanched almond in the center of each macaroon. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheets. Remove to a rack to finish cooling. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 2 months.
