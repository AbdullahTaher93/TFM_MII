Sprinkle the cubes of beef with salt and pepper. In a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil until very hot. Add half of the beef and brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to the slow cooker. Repeat the browning with the remaining beef. Add the onions to the skillet and brown slightly over medium-high heat; add the garlic and cook just for 15 seconds or so, then add the onions and garlic to the crock. Pour the tomatoes and wine into the sauté pan and raise the heat to high. Stir constantly while bringing to a boil, scraping up the browned bits accumulated on the bottom of the pan. Pour into the crock. Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 8 hours, until the meat is tender. During the last 45 minutes of cooking, check the consistency. If the juices are too thin for you, increase the heat to HIGH and leave the cover off, letting some moisture evaporate. Serve hot.
