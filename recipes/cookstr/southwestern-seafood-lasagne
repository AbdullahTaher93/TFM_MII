Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Grease a 10-inch round baking dish. If desired, fry the tortillas: Heat Â½ inch of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add tortillas, 1 at a time, and fry on each side only until soft. Drain on paper towels. (Omit frying to decrease calories.) Process chiles, tomatillos, sour cream, garlic, and salt in a food processor or blender until pureed to make a sauce. Place 1 or 2 spoons of sauce in prepared dish and overlap 3 tortillas over sauce. Add a layer of one-fourth of the cheese, onions, shrimp, scallops, and sauce. Repeat to make 4 layers. Pour the half-and-half evenly over the dish. Bake, uncovered, 30 minutes or until bubbly.
