In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute or until softened. Do not allow to brown. Add chicken pieces; cook until browned on all sides. Add wine and vinegar; increase heat slightly and bring to a gentle boil. Cook for about 5 minutes. Add whole and chopped olives, parsley, salt and pepper. Stir until well mixed. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, periodically turning chicken to make sure it cooks thoroughly. Add a splash of water or wine if chicken looks too dry. Arrange chicken pieces on a warm serving platter and pour sauce over. Serve with fresh lemon wedges if desired.
