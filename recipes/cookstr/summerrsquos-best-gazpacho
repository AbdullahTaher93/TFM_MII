In a medium nonreactive bowl, mix all of the ingredients together. Working in batches using a blender or food processor, pulse the mixture once or twice so that it is blended but the vegetables still have texture. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Transfer to a glass bowl or plastic container and refrigerate until ready to serve.
