Rinse the squabs and dry well inside and out. Trim the giblets of any dark spots, fat, and membrane and chop roughly; set aside. Use kitchen string to tie the legs of each squab loosely together. In a heavy-bottomed, wide, deep skillet or Dutch oven large enough to accommodate the 4 birds, warm the oil and garlic together over medium-low heat. Sauté until the garlic is nicely golden, about 4 minutes. Tie the sage and rosemary sprigs together with kitchen string and add to the pan along with the cloves, lemon zest, and chopped giblets. Sauté until the giblets are nicely browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic, raise the heat to medium, and add the birds; brown them evenly, about 15 minutes. Add the wine, vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste and deglaze the pan, stirring to dislodge any bits stuck to the bottom. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the squabs are tender, about 15 minutes longer, adding a few tablespoons of water, when necessary, to keep the birds moist. Be sure not to overcook them, or their meat will dry out. Scoop out and discard the bundled herbs, cloves, and lemon zest from the pan juices and check for seasoning. Remove the pan from the heat and let the birds settle for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toast the bread. Remove the strings from the birds. Serve each squab on a plate alongside a slice of bread. Defat the pan juices and pour over each serving.
