Remove the skin from the chicken and trim off any visible pieces of fat. Wash the chicken and blot dry. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and toss with the flour in a mixing bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large nonstick saut√© pan. Brown the chicken in the oil over medium heat, turning the pieces with tongs, working in several batches as needed to avoid crowding the pan. Transfer the chicken to a platter lined with paper towels. Brown the bacon in the same pan and transfer to the platter. Pour off any fat and rinse and dry the pan. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the pan and add the shallots and garlic. Cook over medium low heat until soft but not brown, about 3 minutes, stirring often. Return the chicken to the pan. Add the wine and bouquet garni and bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dissolve any congealed pan juices. Reduce the heat and gently simmer the chicken for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Skim off any fat that may rise to the surface with a spoon. Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables. Cook the baby onions in 1 quart rapidly boiling salted water until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onions with a slotted spoon to a colander to drain. Cook the carrots in the same water until tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer the carrots to the colander with a slotted spoon. Cut any large mushroom caps in quarters; medium-size caps in half; leave the small ones whole. Boil the mushrooms until tender, about 1 minute, and transfer to the colander. Add the onions, carrots, mushrooms, and Canadian bacon to the coq au vin. Continue simmering until the chicken is cooked and tender and the sauce is reduced and well flavored, about 10 minutes more. The total cooking time will be 30 to 40 minutes. Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste. Discard the bouquet garni. Just before serving, transfer the coq au vin to a platter and sprinkle with the chopped parsley.
