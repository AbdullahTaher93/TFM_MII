Grill with charcoal and hickory or oak. Wash and clean the oyster shells thoroughly. Keep the oysters on ice until ready to cook. Prepare a hickory or oak fire with a lot of kindling. Set a large rack over the fire. When the coals are a dusty red glow, place the oysters on the rack and cook. As the oysters open, remove with long tongs. Pry open with a knife and eat immediately. The oysters will have a pungent, smoky flavor.
