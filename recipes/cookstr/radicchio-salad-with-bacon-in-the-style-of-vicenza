Cut the heads of radicchio in half through the stem end. Using a paring knife, remove and discard the core portion on the base of each half. Shred the radicchio into bite-size pieces, then rinse well and dry thoroughly in a salad spinner or by some other method. Place the radicchio in a serving bowl. In a skillet, warm the 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the bacon and saut√© until the bacon bits are nicely colored but not burnt. This should take only a few minutes. Drain off the excess bacon fat and add salt and pepper to taste and the vinegar. Use a wooden spoon to deglaze the skillet, scraping up any bacon bits stuck to the bottom as the vinegar reduces, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the bacon cool a bit, then stir in olive oil to taste. Pour the dressing over the salad, using only as much as is needed to coat the radicchio lightly and evenly. Serve at once.
