Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Place the chicken halves in a large container and pour the marinade over the top. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Fire up the grill or preheat the broiler. Remove the chickens from the marinade (but don’t wipe the herbs off; they’re delicious charred right on the skin). Season with more salt and pepper. If you’re using a grill: Place the chickens skin-side down and grill them on high. After 2 minutes, turn the halves 45°. After another 2 minutes, flip the halves over. After another 2 minutes, turn the halves 45° again. Turn the heat down to medium and cook the chicken until the juice runs clear when you stick a leg with a knife, about 20 minutes, depending on your grill. Or If you’re using a broiler: Place the chickens on a roasting rack and broil them until the skins are crisp, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to 425° and bake the chicken until the juice runs clear when you stick a leg with a knife, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately, with the vegetables and accompaniments of your choice, leftovers make great chicken salad.
