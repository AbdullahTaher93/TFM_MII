In a large kettle, combine the oil and wine over high heat. Bring to a boil, add the fennel julienne and reduce the heat to low. Simmer until tender, about 8 minutes. Increase the heat to moderately high and add the mussels and remaining ingredients. Cover tightly and steam until the mussels open. Discard any that do not open. Serve the mussels in heated bowls with some of the liquid ladled over.
