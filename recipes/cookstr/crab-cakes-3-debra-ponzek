For breadcrumbs, tear 4 slices of bread, crusts removed, into 1-inch pieces. Pulse in the food processor until the crumbs are medium-fine. In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs, add the mayonnaise and mustard, and combine. Add the crabmeat and toss lightly. Add the parsley, scallions, capers, and cornichons and mix. Gently fold in 1½ cups of the breadcrumbs. Add the Old Bay Seasoning and the cayenne. Form into 2-inch cakes and coot lightly with the remaining ½ cup of breadcrumbs. Refrigerate 1 hour. In a large skillet, heat the oil until shimmering over medium-high heat. (The oil should come one third of the way up the crab cakes.) Fry the cakes until golden brown and drain on paper towels. Serve hot.
