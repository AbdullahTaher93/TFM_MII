In a deep, covered pan, combine all of the filling ingredients. Add ½ cup water and mix well. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Decrease the heat to a simmer and cover. Preheat the oven to 400°F. To make the dough, in a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut the Crisco into the mixture with a fork or pastry blender until it has the texture of coarse meal. Add the eggs and ¾ cup water. Mix well until the dough holds together in a ball and divide it into two equal parts. Turn one part out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a rectangle about ¼ inch thick and shaped to fit a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with enough overlap to form the side crust. Transfer the dough to a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and trim the edges to fit the pan. Press the dough into the pan, making sure to get the corners. Pour the warm peach mixture into the pan, spreading evenly. Roll the second part of the dough into a rectangle the same size as the first. Using a sharp knife, cut four ½-inch strips lengthwise. lay each strip evenly apart on top of the peach mixture, trimming the edges and tucking them underneath the bottom crust. Re-roll the dough if needed, and cut four more ½-inch strips widthwise. Lay the strips across the first four, creating a lattice pattern. Trim any overhang and tuck the strips underneath the bottom crust. Bake the cobbler in the lower portion of the oven for about 30 minutes, until the peach mixture bubbles and the dough is golden brown. Cool until the cobbler sets, about 20 minutes.
