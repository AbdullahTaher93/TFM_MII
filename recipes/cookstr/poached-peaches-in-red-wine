Place the peaches in a large pot with 1Â½ cups of the sugar, the lemon juice, and cinnamon stick. Add cold water to cover. Cover the peaches with a round of waxed paper cut to fit the interior of the pot. Set the pot over moderately high heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Simmer until the peaches can be pierced easily with a sharp paring knife, about 10 to 15 minutes after the water begins to simmer. Cool the peaches in the liquid. Remove the skins with a paring knife. Strain the juice and reserve 3 cups for syrup. Pour the remaining juice over the peaches. Prepare the syrup: In a heavy saucepan, heat the reserved 3 cups poaching liquid with the remaining 1 cup sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until reduced by one-third. Allow to cool. Remove the peaches from their juice and place them in a large bowl. Discard the juices. Add the wine and reduced syrup. Serve the peaches as dessert and serve the wine as an accompaniment to the meal.
