Preheat the oven to 375°F. Drain the sauerkraut, rinse well under cold running water, and squeeze dry with your hands. In a mixing bowl combine the sauerkraut, fruit purée, and caraway seeds; season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a medium-size ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the pork chops and sauté until somewhat browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the chops to a dinner plate. Off the heat, stir the sauerkraut mixture into the pan juices in the skillet. When this is well mixed, place the seared pork chops on top and place the skillet in the oven. Bake uncovered until the pork is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Variation Substitute 1 tablespoon brown sugar, ½ cup milk or heavy or whipping cream, and 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard for the fruit purée and caraway. Proceed as directed.
