Arrange the beef, mushrooms, green onion pieces, cabbage, spinach, tofu, noodles, if using, and chopped green onions on a platter at the table, and set out the sauces in small bowls. Fill an electric wok or fondue pot two-thirds full of the broth. Bring the broth to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer gently for 2 minutes. Provide each diner with chopsticks or a fondue fork. Cook the mushrooms, green onion pieces, and cabbage in the broth for 1 to 2 minutes, then add the meat, spinach, and tofu and cook 2 more minutes. Diners may choose to add one-fourth of the meat and vegetables at a time and then dip the cooked morsels into the sauces provided. When all the diners have had their fill of the vegetables and meat, add the noodles, if using, to the broth and heat through. Finally, add the chopped green onions to the broth and ladle into small bowls for sipping.
