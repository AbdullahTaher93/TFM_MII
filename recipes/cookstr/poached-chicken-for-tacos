Cut the breast in half. Put the chicken into a pan with chicken broth to cover and bring to a simmer. Continue simmering until just tender but not soft, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool off in the broth. Strain and strip the meat from the bone, discard the bone, and shred together with some of the skin for extra flavor.
