To make this stock on top of the stove, in a tall narrow stockpot, bring the bones and water to a boil. Skim the fat. Lower the heat and simmer gently, so bubbles are barely breaking the surface of the liquid, for at least 4 hours and up to 12; add water as needed to keep the bones covered. Skim as necessary (see Notes) to remove as much fat as possible. If the pot is covered with an otoshi-buta or a lid slightly ajar, there will be less evaporation. To make the stock in the oven, place a rack on the lowest level of the oven and heat the oven to 250°F (121°C; gas mark #½; #½ British regulo). In a tall narrow stockpot, bring the bones and water to a boil. Skim the fat. Place in the oven for 4 hours; add water if needed. Remove and skim the fat. Return to the Oven for at least 5 hours and up to 8. To make the stock in a slow-cooker, start with 2½ pounds (1.1 kg) bones and 6 cups (1.5 l) water for a 4-quart (4-l) cooker. Place the bones in the slow-cooker and pour the water over. Cover and turn the heat on low. Cook for 11 to 12 hours. In all methods, the bones will be falling apart when the stock is done. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve. Skim fat. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for 3 hours. Remove the fat from the top of the stock and the sediment from the bottom (see Notes). Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze.
