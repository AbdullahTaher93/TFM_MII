Place the tomatoes on the grill, close the lid, and cook for a few minutes per side. Remove the bread to a cutting board, cut into ¾-inch cubes, and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the tomatoes, onion, olive oil, vinegar, herbs, salt, and pepper. Toss gently with your hands to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings if you desire. Serve at room temperature.
