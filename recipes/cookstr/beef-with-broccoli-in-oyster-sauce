In a small bowl, combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, pepper and chicken stock and stir well. Set aside. Heat a wok or a large deep skillet over high heat. Add oil and swirl to coat pan. Add garlic and toss well, until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add beef and cook, tossing occasionally, until no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Add broccoli florets and cook, tossing once, until tender-crisp, for 1 minute. Add oyster sauce mixture, pouring in around sides of pan. Cook, tossing occasionally, until broccoli is tender and beef is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate. Serve hot or warm.
