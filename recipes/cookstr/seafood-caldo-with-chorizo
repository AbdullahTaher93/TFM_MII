Bring the wine and water to a boil in a large deep skillet with a tight-fitting lid over high heat. Add the clams, cover, and boil until the clams open, 4 to 8 minutes, removing the clams to a bowl with a slotted spoon as soon as they open. Discard any unopened clams. Strain the cooking liquid through a dampened coffee filter or several layers of damp cheesecloth to remove grit. You should have about 2 cups; add more water if you have less. Add the saffron to the liquid and set aside. Store the clams in the refrigerator while the stew cooks. Heat the oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the chorizo slices on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Add the onion, bell pepper, and celery and sauté until tender and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add three-quarters of the garlic and sauté for another 30 seconds. Add the reserved clam cooking liquid, the diced tomatoes, bay leaf, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper and bring to a simmer. Pour into the slow cooker, cover the cooker, and cook for 3 to 4 hours on high, or 6 to 8 hours on low. Meanwhile, mix together the remaining garlic, lemon juice and zest, parsley, and almonds; set aside. About 30 minutes before serving, remove the clams from the refrigerator and turn the slow cooker to high. Add the salmon and shrimp to the slow cooker, push gently to submerge, and cook until the fish flakes when pressed gently, about 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaf. To serve, place 3 clams in each of 6 large soup bowls Ladle the caldo over the clams and sprinkle with some of the parsley mixture; serve immediately.
