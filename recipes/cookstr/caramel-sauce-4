In a high-sided pot, heat the cream to just before boiling. Keep warm. In a 6-quart or larger heavy pot, combine 1 1?2 cups of the sugar and the corn syrup. Melt over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the sugar and syrup start to boil. Continue to cook until the sugar turns a rich amber color but before it becomes nearly black, 6 to 8 minutes. (If the sugar starts to smoke and turn black, it's burned; start over.) Lower the heat to very low. In three stages, stir in the remaining 1 1?2 cups sugar, stirring between each addition to dissolve the sugar before adding more. Raise the heat to the point at which small bubbles start to foam up around the sides of the pot. In three stages, add the warm cream, simmering to partially reduce it between each addition before adding more. The caramel will bubble up vigorously; stir to keep it from boiling over. Continue to cook the caramel until it forms a thick syrup. If you draw a finger through the caramel coating the back of the spoon, it will hold the line. Turn the heat off and season with the salt and vanilla. Cool completely.
