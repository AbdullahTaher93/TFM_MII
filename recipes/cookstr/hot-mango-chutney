Remove the stem, seeds, and veins from the chile and cut into needle-thin julienne. In a saucepan, combine the mangoes, tequila and sugar over moderate heat. Stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar dissolves and the mangoes begin to give off their juice. Add the chile julienne and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside to cool. When the mixture has cooled, fold in the pinon nuts. Serve at room temperature with Turkey Mole.
