Heat enough canola oil to fill a deep pot 1/3 up. If you have a thermometer, test that the oil has reached 375Â°F. If not, do one test shrimp first. Make sure the shrimp are completely dry. In a colander, shake the shrimp with a few sprinkles of flour until only a very thin dusting clings to them. Drop them into the hot oil. Do not crowd the pot. Fry for about 5 minutes, until the shrimp are light golden brown. Place them on a rack or a plate covered with paper towels to drain the excess oil, and sprinkle with a few pinches of salt. Serve immediately.
