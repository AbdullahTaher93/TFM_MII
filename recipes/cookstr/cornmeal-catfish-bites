Cut the catfish into 1- to 1½-inch cubes. In a large shallow bowl or deep pie plate, stir together the catfish cubes and buttermilk. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. In another large shallow bowl or pie plate, stir together the cornmeal and salt. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Piece by piece, dredge the catfish cubes in the cornmeal and place in the frying pan. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Transfer to a large baking sheet and keep warm in a 200°F oven. When ready to pass around, top with a bamboo cocktail fork. Serve with dipping cups of hot sauce or add a splash to each bite.
