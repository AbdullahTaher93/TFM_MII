Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a baking sheet or line with parchment paper. Mix the oil (or cream the butter) and sugar together in a large bowl. Add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time, and stir until well blended. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring constantly. Add your nuts or any other addition. Continue mixing until blended. The dough will be slightly sticky, so you should flour your hands as you work with it. Divide the dough into either 2 logs (12 by 2 inches) or 4 logs (6 by 2 inches). Make sure you place them several inches (at least 3 inches) apart because they will expand. Bake for 35 minutes or until the logs are light brown. Let cool for 10 minutes. Then turn the heat down to 275°F. Using a sharp, serrated knife, cut the logs into diagonal slices, about 3?4-inch long. You can place them on their sides (or stand them upright on the baking sheet) and bake them for an additional 10 minutes. (This is why they are called twice-baked.) Cool before serving.
