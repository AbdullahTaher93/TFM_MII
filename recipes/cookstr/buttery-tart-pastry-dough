In a food processor fitted with metal blade, pulse flour, sugar and salt until combined, about 5 times. Remove lid and distribute butter evenly over top. Cover and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 20 times. In a container with a pouring spout, mix together egg yolks and cold water. With motor running, slowly pour mixture through the feed tube in a steady stream until dough begins to gather. Do not overprocess or let a ball form. The dough will be somewhat crumbly at this point. Transfer dough to a board and press lightly with palm of your hand to warm up. It is now ready to press out into tart pans, if desired. Press half of the dough evenly into sides and bottoms of each pan. Trim excess dough from top. Fill and bake according to recipe directions. Variation Savory Buttery Tart Pastry: You can make a savory tart shell by omitting the sugar and adding 1.4 cup (50 mL) additional all-purpose flour.
