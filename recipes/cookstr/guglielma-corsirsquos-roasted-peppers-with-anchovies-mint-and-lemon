To roast the peppers, arrange them on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet 3 inches under a preheated broiler or in an oven preheated to 400 degrees F. Alternatively, place them on a grill rack above a charcoal fire. Roast them until they are charred all over and tender inside, turning them frequently to ensure that they blacken evenly, about 30 minutes in the oven but less time by the other methods. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins using your fingertips, cut the peppers in half lengthwise, and remove and discard the stems, ribs, and seeds. (Do not do this under running water; it will wash away some of the delicious smoky flavor.) For this dish, I like to slice each pepper section into 2 or 3 strips. Arrange the pepper strips in an attractive circular fashion on a serving platter. Fit the whole anchovy fillets in between the pepper sections, making a pattern of several pepper strips alternating with an anchovy fillet, to present a pleasing design. Strew the mint leaves generously over the peppers, leaving them whole if they are small and tearing them into several pieces if they are large. Sprinkle the peppers lightly with the lemon juice, then drizzle lightly with the olive oil. Serve at room temperature.
