To parch chiles, first wash them, removing all sand and dirt. Leave the stem on, then pierce each one with a sharp knife, about one inch down from the stem. For large quantities, cover the entire top rack of an electric oven with heavy foil; if yours is a gas stove, cover the broiler rack. For smaller quantities, cover a baking sheet. Then place the rack under an electric broiler four inches from the broiler unit; if using gas, place the rack in the highest position, Preheat the broiler, then place a single layer of chiles on the foil. Allow each side to blister before turning. Allow each chile to uniformly blister for easy removal of the peel. As soon as each chile is parched, remove to the sink, a large bowl, or a tub of ice water. Immerse each chile in water. Allow to cool, then either peel or package in plastic freezer bags. To peel, always start at the stem and pull off strips of the peel. Blot dry between layers of paper towels before using. For rellenos, keep the stem on, but for other uses, remove. For a milder taste, once the chile is parched, strip out the seeds and veins with the back side of a knife. If you are parching only a few chiles, place each directly on a medium-hot electric surface unit, or hold it with tongs or a meat fork over a gas burner. If parching outdoors on a charcoal grill, place the rack about four inches above white-hot coals. Watch carefully â€” the chiles parch quickly.
