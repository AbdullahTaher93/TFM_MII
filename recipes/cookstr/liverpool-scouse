Preheat the oven to 325 F. Sear lamb and beef cubes quickly in an iron skillet, turning often over high heat, in a little oil. As meat begins to brown, add onions, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir often. Pour into a casserole and add all other ingredients (except salt and pepper). Add enough hot water to just cover all ingredients. Cover with lid and cook in the center of the oven for approximately 4 hours. Taste and add salt and pepper as necessary
