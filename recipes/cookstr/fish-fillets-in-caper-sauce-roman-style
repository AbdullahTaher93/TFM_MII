Pat the fillets dry with paper towels. This step is very important in order to sauté the fillets properly. Place a large piece of waxed paper on your work surface and measure the flour onto it. Sprinkle with the pepper, then spread the flour out. In a large skillet, melt the butter with the oil over medium heat. Meanwhile, lightly dredge the fillets in the flour. Dredging must be done at the last minute to assure a crisp coating. When the butter foam has subsided, slip the fillets into the skillet. Sauté over medium to medium-high heat until lightly golden, about 1 minute on each side depending on the thickness of the fillets, turning them only once. Transfer to a heated platter and reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the capers and wine. Stir to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until the alcohol has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in the parsley and salt. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the sauce over the fish. Serve immediately,
