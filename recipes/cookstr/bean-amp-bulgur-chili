Heat olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until the onions are softened. Add celery, carrots, tomatoes, lemon juice, ground chiles, cumin, pepper, and oregano to the onions and cook, covered, until the vegetables are nearly tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the bell peppers and cook 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the tomato juice to a boil in a small saucepan and stir in bulgur. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 10 minutes. Add kidney beans and salt to the vegetables, then add the bulgur mixture. Stir thoroughly and simmer 30 minutes over low heat. The chili will be thick; add water as needed and stir occasionally to keep from sticking. Taste and adjust seasoning before serving.
