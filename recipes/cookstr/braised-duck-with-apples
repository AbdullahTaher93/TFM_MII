Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Salt and pepper the duck legs and wings on both sides, then, working in batches, brown the duck, about 5 minutes per side. Set aside. Pour off all but enough fat to coat the skillet. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and a little salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften and begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and the sprigs of thyme and tarragon. Cook until the vegetables are almost tender, 3 to 5 minutes more. Arrange the duck, skin-side up, over the vegetables. Add enough stock to cover the vegetables but not the duck. Bring the stock to a simmer. Add the apples and transfer the skillet to the oven. Gently simmer-just an occasional bubble-basting occasionally, until the duck is very tender and well browned about 2 hours. Remove the duck from the pan and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Strain the braising liquid, pressing the vegetables and apples with a wooden spoon. Discard the vegetables and apples and return the liquid to the skillet. Bring it to a simmer and skim off the fat. Whisk the butter and chopped thyme and tarragon into the braising liquid. Return the duck to the skillet, heat through, then serve.
