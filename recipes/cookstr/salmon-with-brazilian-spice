Preheat lightly greased grill to medium-high. In a bowl combine garlic, lemon juice, orange juice, orange zest, brown sugar, cayenne, bay leaves, salt and pepper. Whisk together well. Lay fish in baking dish. Pour marinade over fish, turning to coat well. Cover with plastic wrap; marinate for 30 minutes, turning once or twice. Remove fish from baking dish, discarding any remaining marinade. Brush a little olive oil on both sides of fillets. Place fish on grill, skin-side down. Cook, turning once, for 8 to 10 minutes or according to taste. Serve immediately with fresh lemon wedges.
