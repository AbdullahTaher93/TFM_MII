Using forks, pull apart the seitan into irregular shapes. In a heavy skillet with a cover, heat the two types of sesame oil together over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, and saute until the garlic begins to brown (2-5 minutes). Add the seitan pieces to the skillet and saute over medium heat until browned and a little crispy (about 15 minutes). While the seitan is browning, combine the molasses, soy sauce, coriander, black pepper, and hot pepper oil in a small, bowl. Add this mixture to the skillet, coating the seitan evenly. Add the rice wine. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover the skillet, add the scallions, and increase the heat to high. Continue to simmer the seitan for about 1 minute, or until the liquid has been reduced to a coating for the seitan. Serve over couscous or brown rice as a main or side dish. As an appetizer, serve Coriander-Braised Seitan with chilled radishes and cucumbers.
