Preheat the oven to 300°F. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter together over medium-high heat until the butter has melted. Add the onion and garlic and cook until very soft and transparent, 10 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Layer the vegetables and herbs in an 8 by 8-inch pan as follows: sautéed onions-garlic mixture; the eggplant drizzled with olive oil, and light salt and pepper; the zucchini sprinkled with half of the herbs, and light salt and pepper; the yellow squash, remaining herbs, and light salt and pepper; and the tomatoes. Drizzle olive oil over the top and cover tightly with foil. Place on a baking sheet to catch any overflowing juices, and bake 1½ hours, then remove the foil and bake another ½ hour. Carefully pour off the juices and discard. The confit is ready to be served, but it will be loose. For a nicer presentation, cover the cooled confit with parchment or waxed paper and a pan of the same size, place 4 soup cans in the pan to weight it, and refrigerate for 1 day or overnight. The confit will be firm enough to slice easily.
