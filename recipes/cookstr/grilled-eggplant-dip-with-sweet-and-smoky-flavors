Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375°F. Spread the pine nuts in a shallow metal pan, like a cake tin, and toast them, stirring often, until they are crisp and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool. Meanwhile, light a direct-heat charcoal fire and let it burn down to medium-hot (5 seconds to “ouch”), or preheat a gas grill to medium-high. Position the rack about 6 inches above the heat source. Brush the eggplant slices on both sides with 4 tablespoons of the oil. When the grill is ready, lay the eggplant slices on the rack. Cover and grill, turning once, until the eggplant slices are tender and well-browned, about 9 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool. Coarsely chop the eggplant. In a food processor, combine the eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, vinegar, chipotles, garlic, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and salt. Process, stopping several times to scrape down the sides of the work bowl, until the mixture is almost pureed (leave a bit of texture). Adjust the seasoning. (The dip can be prepared up to this point 2 days ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate, returning it to room temperature for serving.) Transfer the dip to a serving dish. Sprinkle the pine nuts and the cilantro over the dip. Serve, accompanied by the com chips, for scooping.
