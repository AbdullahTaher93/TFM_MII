Bring a saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add the salt first, then the peas, and boil, uncovered, for 1-Â½ minutes. Drain, immediately plunge them into cold water to stop further cooking, and drain again. Place the peas in a salad bowl and add pepper to taste, almonds, olive oil, orange juice, and mint or basil. Toss well and serve. This salad will stay crisp for several hours at room temperature.
