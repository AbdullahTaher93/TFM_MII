Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Arrange the potatoes in a 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bake 25 minutes, stirring once, about halfway through. Add the green beans and lemon juice, stirring to coat with the oil. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, if needed. Bake an additional 15 minutes, or until the beans are tender. Remove from the oven and stir in the parsley and rosemary. Serve hot.
