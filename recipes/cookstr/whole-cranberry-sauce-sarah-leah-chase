Place the cranberries, port, orange juice, apricots, and sugars in a saucepan. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries are cooked and the sauce is thick, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat, cool, and stir in the pecan halves. Store covered in the refrigerator. The mixture will keep for several weeks and is best brought to room temperature before serving.
