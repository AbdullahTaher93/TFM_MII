Using a mandoline if you have one, or a very sharp knife if you don’t, cut the carrots into 1/2-by-4-inch matchsticks; set aside. In a canning kettle or a stockpot, cover 4 widemouthed, quart-size canning jars with boiling water. Simmer, covered, over low heat while the pickles are prepared. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the vinegar. water, sugar, salt, bay leaves, and allspice and bring the liquid to a boil; reduce the heat to a simmer, and cover. In a large kettle over high heat, bring 4 quarts of water to a full, rolling boil. Drop in the carrot sticks and cook for 1 minute, drain in a colander. then transfer to sterilized canning jars. Pour the spiced vinegar mixture over the carrots, dividing spices evenly among the jars and allowing 1/2 inch of headspace at the top of each jar. Seal the jars according to the manufacturer’s instructions and return the sealed jars to the hot water bath. Simmer for 20 minutes; then, using special canning tongs or ordinary tongs and a kitchen rowel, remove the jars from the hot water bath. Cool the jars at room temperature for several hours or overnight. Check the lids to make sure the jars have sealed. Any jars that fail to seal may be kept refrigerated for several months. Sealed jars will keep in a cool, dark place for a year. Serve the pickles as a garnish for sandwiches or salads.
