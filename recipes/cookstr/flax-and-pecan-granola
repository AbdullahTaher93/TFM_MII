Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C, or gas mark 2). Grease 2 rimmed baking sheets and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the pecans, oats, coconut, pepitas, flaxseed meal, brown sugar, salt, maple syrup, vanilla, and canola oil. Stir to coat all of the ingredients well with the maple syrup. Pour onto the greased baking sheets and spread into an even layer. Bake for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent over-browning of the granola at the edges. Remove the granola from the oven, stir in the raisins, and let cool. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
