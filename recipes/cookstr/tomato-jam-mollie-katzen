Cut the tomatoes into small cubes, and place them in a medium-sized saucepan. Cover the pot, and place it over medium heat. When the tomatoes begin to boil, reduce the heat to medium, uncover the pot, and let them cook for 10 minutes. Stir in the salt, sugar, vinegars, and optional basil sprigs, and continue to cook, uncovered, over medium heat for another 35 minutes, or until the mixture is reduced in volume by about two thirds. (In other words, it should be approximately one third of its original volume. This is inexactâ€”you can eyeball it.) Remove the pot from the heat, and fish out and discard the basil. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then transfer to a clean, tightly capped jar, and store for up to several weeks in the refrigerator. Serve cold.
