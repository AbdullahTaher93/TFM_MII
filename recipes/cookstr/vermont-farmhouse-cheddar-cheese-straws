Remove 1 pastry sheet from the package and let thaw at room temperature for 30 minutes. Tightly seal the remaining pastry and freeze for another use. Position one rack in the center and a second rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 425°F. Have ready 2 rimmed baking sheets, preferably nonstick. For pans without a nonstick finish, line the pans with parchment paper or use Silpat mats. In a small bowl, mix together the cheese, chives, thyme, pimenton, and cayenne pepper. Set aside. Unfold the pastry sheet and place it on a lightly floured cutting board. If there are any cracks in the pastry, gently pinch them closed. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll over the pastry gently, just enough to remove the fold marks, and then roll it out into a 10-by-15-inch rectangle. Cut in half lengthwise to form two 5-by-15-inch rectangles. Brush each piece with the egg wash. Arrange 1 piece of the dough with the long side, facing you and distribute the cheese filling evenly over it. Place the second piece of dough, egg wash side down, on top of the cheese, lining up the edges evenly. Using the rolling pin, press the sheets together to secure the cheese firmly between the layers, especially at the edges. Using a sharp knife or pizza wheel, cut the filled and pressed pastry crosswise into 30 strips, each ½-inch wide. Working with 1 strip at a time, twist 3 times and lay the cheese straw on a baking sheet, pressing down the ends firmly to keep it from untwisting during baking. Continue to twist and arrange the remaining strips, placing them 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 8 minutes, switch the position of the baking sheets, and continue to bake until the cheese straws are puffed, golden brown, and crisp about 4 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.
