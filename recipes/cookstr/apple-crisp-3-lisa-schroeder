Heat the oven to 350°F. Spray the bottom and sides of a 13x9x2-inch baking dish or spray with nonstick cooking spray. To make the filling: Peel the apples, and then cut each of the four sides off the apple as close to the core as possible. (This way you save a step by coring and slicing at the same time.) Slice the quarters into ¼-inch-thick slices. Place the apples in a large mixing bowl, and add the lemon juice, cinnamon, and sugar. Toss to coat. Pour the mixture into the prepared dish. To make the topping: Place the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter pieces and toss to coat. Using a pastry blender or large whisk, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until it forms large crumbs. Stir in the nuts. Alternatively, place the dry ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Mix or pulse to combine, then scatter the butter over the mixture. Mix on low speed or pulse until the mixrure forms small clumps (about 3 minutes). Stir in the nuts. Scatter the topping over the fruit, squeezing it with your hands as you go to create larger pieces (they will cook up extra-crispy and provide more texture). Lightly press the topping down into the fruit. Bake on the middle rack in the oven until the topping is brown and the filling is bubbly, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes before serving. Serve alone or with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or a drizzle of heavy cream.
