First make the sauce. Chop the vegetables and sauté them gently in the 2 tablespoons butter, together with the bouquet garni, clove, and a little salt and pepper. When they are golden, add the vinegar and the red wine and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain the sauce. Meanwhile, poach the prunes in water just to cover for 20 minutes; drain. Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan and sauté the pork chops on both sides, seasoning them with salt and pepper. When they are cooked and golden brown, remove and keep warm. Work the butter and flour together with your fingers to make a beurre manié and add it, broken into little pieces, to the sauce. Let it cook gently for a few minutes until the ingredients are well blended and the sauce thickens. Add the hot prunes and taste for seasoning. To serve, arrange the chops on a dish, pour over the sauce, placing the prunes around the edge, and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Steamed potatoes are good with these chops.
