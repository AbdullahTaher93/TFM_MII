Place the brown sugar, swet paprika, coarse salt, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion, powder, mustard and celery seed in a bowl and mix with your fingers, breaking up any lumps in the brown sugar, garlic powder, or mustard with your fingers. Store the rub in an airtight jar away from heat or light; it will keep for several weeks. Plan on using 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of rub per rack of baby back backs; more for larger racks of ribs.
