Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the fish: Julienne the orange zests and blanch them in boiling water for 2 minutes. Remove and set aside for later use. Remove the white outer part from the oranges. Slice the oranges (into approximately 3/8-inch slices). Grease the bottom of a baking pan. Add the salmon and season to taste. Cover the fillets with a pinch of crushed coriander seeds, half of the zests, shallots, and the oranges slices. Warm up ¼ cup orange juice with the remaining coriander seeds. Pour in the fish pan, cover with aluminum foil, and bake for 20 minutes, or until the flesh start to flake. Transfer the fish and accompaniment to a serving platter. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Place the cooking liquid in a saucepan. Add the remaining zests, orange juice, and honey. Bring to a boil and reduce to ¾ cup. Thicken with a little cornstarch mixed with water. Strain and return to the pan. Add parsley and season to taste. Pour the sauce over the fish. For the vegetables: Preheat a steamer. Add the asparagus and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until desired doneness. Transfer the asparagus to a serving plate, sprinkle with a little orange juice, and season to taste. Serve the salmon with the asparagus.
