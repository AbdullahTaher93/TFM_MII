Heat the olive oil in a large heavy soup pot over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion, and carrot and cook, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant and the vegetables begin to soften, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the fish frames, whole fish, and the tomatoes, cover, and cook until the fish is opaque and the tomatoes have thrown off some of their juices, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 11 cups water and the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil, thoroughly skimming off the foam. Add the mussels and crabs, if using, and the parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, until the stock is flavorful, about 30 minutes. If youâ€™d like stronger-tasting stock, reduce it over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes longer. Strain the stock through a fine sieve into a clean pot or bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids, taste the stock, and adjust the amount of salt and pepper. If using the stock right away, skim off as much fat as you can. Otherwise, place the stock, covered, in the refrigerator and remove the fat when chilled. The stock will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days and can be frozen for up to 3 months.
