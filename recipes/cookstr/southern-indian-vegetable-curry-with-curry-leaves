Heat the oil in a pan and fry the mustard seeds for 2 to 3 minutes or until they start to pop. Add the chillies, curry leaves, onions, coriander (cilantro), cumin seeds, garam masala, turmeric, and chilli powder. Stir and cook over a medium heat until the onion is soft. Stir in the chopped tomatoes. Add your potatoes and aubergine (eggplant) to the sauce. Pour in the coconut milk and cook until the potato is soft and cooked through. Throw in the beans, peas, and okra. Season and cook for a few more minutes until tender, then serve with some nice fluffy rice.
