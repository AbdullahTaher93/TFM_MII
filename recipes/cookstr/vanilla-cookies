Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and superfine sugar together until pale and fluffy, then beat in the eggs one at a time, and then the vanilla extract. In another bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the butter and eggs, and mix gently until well combined. You will probably find that the electric mixer struggles to combine all of the ingredients once the dry ingredients are added, so you may have to mix it all together with a spoon. Form the dough into a flattened disk and wrap it in plastic wrap before placing it in a refrigerator for at least an hour to firm up. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C/gas mark 4) while you are letting the dough rest. Once the dough is ready to roll out, place it on a lightly floured surface and roll it out to the required thickness. Cut the dough into shapes, using cookie cutters or a knife. Carefully lift the cookies with a palette knife onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Be sure to place the cookies an inch or so apart on the sheets, so that they are not touching. Bake the cookies for 8 to 12 minutes. You’ll know they are ready when the edges just start turning golden. Don’t worry if they are still soft in the middle-they will firm up as they cool. Transfer the cookies from the sheet to a wire rack with a palette knife. Wait until they have completely cooled before decorating.
