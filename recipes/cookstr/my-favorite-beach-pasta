Several hours before you plan to serve the pasta, combine the tomatoes, basil, mint, mozzarella, garlic, pepper, and the Â½ cup olive oil in a large serving bowl. Toss to mix. Let sit to blend the flavors. When you are ready to serve it, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the pasta and cook until it is al dente (just tender), about 11 minutes. Drain the pasta well. Add the hot linguine to the tomato mixture, and toss well. Season with salt, garnish with the scallions, and serve immediately.
