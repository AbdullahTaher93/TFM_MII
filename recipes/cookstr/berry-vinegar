Place the berries in a saucepan and crush them with a potato masher. (For harder berries, such as currants and blueberries, make a puree in a food processor instead.) Pour the vinegar over the berries. Cover the pan and allow the vinegar to steep for several days, giving an occasional stir. At the end of that period, simmer the vinegar for 5 minutes, then strain through cheesecloth. When the vinegar is cool, pour it into a handsome bottle. Store the bottle out of direct sunlight or the lovely liquid may fade to a drab color.
