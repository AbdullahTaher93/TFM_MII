In a medium bowl, beat together eggs, orange zest and juice, sugar, orange-flavored liqueur (if using) and vanilla. Arrange bread, cutting to fit, in single layer in prepared baking dish. Pour orange mixture over top; cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Bake, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until no longer soggy and firm to the touch. Prepare the Orange Marmalade Sauce: meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring marmalade, orange juice, honey and orange-flavored liqueur (if using) to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Serve with French toast.
