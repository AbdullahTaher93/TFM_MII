If possible, several hours before cooking clams, place them in a bowl with cold water and a handful of flour or cornmeal so that they can purge themselves. Refrigerate. Scrub clams well before using. In a large skillet over medium-low heat, combine oil, garlic, and parsley, and cook until garlic softens. Add tomatoes and allow to simmer 2 to 3 minutes. Add clam juice or wine and simmer gently 3 to 4 minutes. Add scrubbed clams, cover tightly, and steam over medium heat until clams open. Add salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile, bring 4 to 5 quarts water to a rapid boil. Add the 1½ tablespoons salt and pasta. Stir immediately and continue to stir frequently to prevent strands from sticking together. Cook until pasta is al dente. Drain and immediately add pasta to clam sauce in skillet; toss. Serve immediately. Do not add grated cheese (grated cheese should never be added to seafood sauces). Pass Italian or French bread at the table for soaking up clam sauce left in plates—not a drop should go to waste!
