To prepare the drunken raspberries, place them in a canning jar or other container with a tight-fitting lid. Add the confectioners’ sugar, close the jar, and gently rotate it to combine the berries and sugar. Add the crème de framboise, sweet vermouth, and lemon juice to the raspberries. Rotate the jar to mix. Use immediately or let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. When ready to serve, fill the highball glasses with ice. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons drunken raspberries with their juice over the ice. Add 2 ounces gin to each highball glass, top off with tonic water, and serve.
