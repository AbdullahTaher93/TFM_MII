1) Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet. Saut√© the onions and garlic over medium heat until the onions soften and turn golden, about 5 minutes. Keep covered between stirrings. Stir in the curry powder and cook 1 minute. Add the ginger and juice from the tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes in your hands as you add them to the pot. Stir in the lemon juice, salt, pepper, and coconut. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. 2) Stir in the fish and cook at a gentle simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, until the fish is cooked through. Serve with rice.
