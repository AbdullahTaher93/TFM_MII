Preheat the grill to high, then lower the heat to medium. Place the poblano and jalape√±o on the grill and roast until the skins blacken, 5 to 7 minutes per side. At the same time, place the corn directly on the grill and grill until the kernels are just colored, 4 to 5 minutes per quarter-turn of the cob. Remove the peppers and corn from the grill. Let the peppers cool in a paper bag; let corn cool sitting out. Place the cooked quinoa in a large bowl. Add the beans, tomatoes, juice of 1 lemon, the jicama, scallions, oil, and herbs. Cut the grilled corn from the cobs and add it to the quinoa bowl. Peel the blackened skin from both peppers. Remove the seeds, fiber, and stems, and dice both peppers. Add the peppers to the quinoa bowl. Toss the ingredients in the bowl together very well, and add salt (it will take a goodly amount) and pepper to taste. Add the juice of the second lemon if needed. Serve, chilled or at room temperature.
