Wash the lentils thoroughly and drain. In a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Add the lentils, onion, garlic, and salt. Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Drain, discarding the onion and garlic. Set aside. Just before serving, toss the lentils with the peppers and vinaigrette; check for seasonings. Serve at room temperature.
