Prepare the squash; peel, halve and scrape out the seeds and pulp. Cut into large chunks (approximately one inch square). You will need eight pounds prepared squash. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the chopped onions and allow to sweat, stirring often. Add the squash cubes and continue cooking until the squash just begins to soften. Add the garlic and water to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and allow to simmer, stirring often. Slowly cook until the squash is soft, about sixty minutes. Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for thirty minutes to allow the mixture to reduce. Let cool, then puree in batches in a blender until completely smooth. Add milk as needed to thin the soup. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
