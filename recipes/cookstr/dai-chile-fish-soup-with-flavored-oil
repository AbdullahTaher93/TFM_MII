Cut the fish into 1- to 2-inch pieces. Place in a small pot, add the water, whole chiles, ginger, garlic, scallions, and coriander, and bring to a boil, then immediately lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. (Meanwhile, prepare the flavored oil.) Add the tomato, the oil, including the garlic slices, and 1Â½ teaspoons salt to the hot broth and simmer for another 5 minutes or so. Taste for salt and adjust if necessary, then add pepper to taste. Serve hot or warm.
