Soak the plank for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4, teaspoon of the pepper and cook, stirring often, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the sherry and chicken stock and bring to a boil. Cook until the sauce is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, vinegar, and tarragon and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and let the sauce cool to room temperature. Prepare the plank for grilling according to the instructions (see Notes). Season the salmon with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Place the salmon on the toasted side of the plank. Spoon the sauce evenly over the salmon and close the lid. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.
