Place the salt and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl or pan. Add 2 quarts of cold water and whisk until the salt and brown sugar dissolve. Add the ribs and refrigerate, covered, until brined, 6 to 8 hours. Place the shallots, garlic, and tarragon in a food processor or blender and finely chop them. Add the Marsala, mustard, and pepper and pulse until blended. Transfer this wet rub to a small nonreactive mixing bowl. Cover and refrigerate if not using immediately. Drain the ribs, discarding the brine. Pat the ribs thoroughly dry on all sides with paper towels. Melt the butter in a medium-size saucepan over low heat. Add the bread crumbs and stir to combine. Transfer the crumb mixture to a shallow plate (a pie plate works well) or bowl. Place a large piece of aluminum foil on a work surface and put the ribs on it. Place a second piece of aluminum foil on a rimmed baking pan. Set the plate of bread crumbs between the ribs and the baking sheet. Using a spatula or your hands, slather the ribs on all sides with the wet rub. Dredge each rib in the bread crumbs and transfer it to the prepared baking sheet. Set up the grill for indirect grilling (see Notes) and preheat to medium (325° to 350°F). Place a large drip pan in the center of the grill under the grate. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Place the ribs in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the ribs until the crust is golden brown, the meat is cooked through, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of a rib registers about 160°F, 30 to 40 minutes. To avoid knocking off the bread crumbs, using a spatula, carefully transfer the ribs to a serving platter or plates. Let the ribs rest for a few minutes before serving.
