In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and saut√© for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the onions begin to turn golden. Stir in the remaining ingredients, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the mixture thickens, approximately 20 minutes. Stir frequently. Use the sauce warm. It keeps, refrigerated, for a couple of weeks.
