To make garlic oil, combine the olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat. When the garlic starts to sizzle, remove from the heat and let sit for half an hour. Discard the garlic cloves and set the oil aside. Cut the endives in half lengthwise, remove the cores, and slice into strips ½ inch wide. In a medium bowl, toss the endives, frisée, cucumber, and fennel with the garlic oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. ON THE PLATE: Divide the salad among 4 plates and top with shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.
