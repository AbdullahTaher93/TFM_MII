Soak the plank for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Set aside. On a well-floured surface, roll out the pizza dough as thinly as possible into a rectangle slightly larger than the plank you are using. Prepare the plank for grilling according to the instructions (see Notes). Lightly spray the toasted side of the plank with the cooking spray and dust with cornmeal. Place the pizza dough on the prepared plank, folding up the edges so that the dough is the same size as the plank. Lightly prick the dough all over with a fork. Close the lid and grill for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the pizza dough is lightly browned and crisp. Open the grill lid and sprinkle the marshmallows, chocolate, graham cracker mixture, and almonds over the pizza dough. Close the lid and grill until the chocolate has just melted and the marshmallows are golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a clean work surface and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
