Heat the oil in a medium-size skillet over medium heat; add the onion and garlic and saut√© until limp, about 5 minutes. Transfer the contents of the skillet to the slow cooker and add the tomato puree, chili sauce, honey, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Cover and cook on LOW for 5 to 8 hours. If the sauce is not thick enough for you, remove the cover, turn the setting to HIGH, and cook for up to 30 minutes longer, until it reaches the desired consistency. Puree in the crock with an immersion blender, or transfer it in batches to a blender or food processor and puree. Cool, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 months.
