Put the tomatoes and water in a small, heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Transfer the tomatoes and their liquid to a food processor. Process for several minutes, until the sauce is fairly smooth and the skins are broken up. If necessary, add more water to loosen the mass and make it easier to purée. Transfer the purée to a clean jar, film the top with the oil, and cover it tightly. Store it in the refrigerator.
