Place the fava beans and pecorino in a small mixing bowl. Drizzle the olive oil over the top and season with salt and pepper. Toss very gently just to combine the flavors and being careful not to break the beans or crush the cheese. Mound a quarter of the beans and cheese in the center of each of 4 salad plates. Top each serving with a few slivers of radicchio. A More Complex Version A More Complex Version For a variation on this recipe, do as my friends at Da I’Frasca of Montevarchi do: For each serving, top ¼ cup/55g fava beans with 2 tablespoons cooked and cooled cannellini beans, drizzle with the olive oil, then top with Pecorino Toscano and a few shavings of white or black truffle.
