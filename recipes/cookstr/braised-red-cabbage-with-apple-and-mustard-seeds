Cook the bacon in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove the bacon to drain on paper towels. Add the mustard seeds to the bacon fat in the skillet. As soon as you begin to hear them pop, add the onion and apples to the pan. Saut√© 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the brown sugar and vinegar and cook a minute or so to dissolve the sugar. Add the cabbage to the skillet and stir to combine with the onion-apple mixture. Stir in the wine and the mustard. Simmer uncovered over medium heat, stirring occasionally, just until the cabbage is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the bacon to the cabbage, season to taste with salt and pepper, then serve at once.
