Preheat the oven to 425Â°F Place a large roasting pan in the oven to preheat. When hot, coat the pan with the oil and heat in the oven for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and arrange the veal bones in a single layer. Return to the oven and roast for 1 hour, turning the bones once or twice, until they are evenly brown on all sides. Add the celery, onions, carrot, garlic, and tomato paste, stirring to mix well. Return to the oven and roast for an additional 15 minutes. Carefully remove from the oven and pour in the wine to deglaze the pan, stirring with a wooden spoon to release any caramelized bits that have stuck to the bottom. Transfer everything to a large stockpot and fill with enough water to cover the ingredients by 1 inch (about 1 gallon). Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and gently simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, diligently skimming any impurities that rise to the surface. Add the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, and coriander. Continue to simmer gently for 3 to 4 hours, skimming occasionally and adding water as needed to keep the bones and vegetables covered. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large container, discarding the solids. Place the saucepan in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool the stock down quickly or let it sit and slowly come to room temperature. Remove any fat that has solidified on the surface. When cool, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 1 month. To Make Demi-Glace: Place 1 quart of veal stock in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat and gently simmer until the liquid is reduced by half (about 2 cups); this takes about 30 minutes. Demi-Glace should have deep brown color and be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. When it is cold, it looks like chocolate Jell-O.
