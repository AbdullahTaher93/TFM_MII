For the Fresh Sweet and Sour Mix: Combine all the ingredients and refrigerate. Depending on the sweetness of the fruit, you may want to add a little more sugar or water, but keep a nice tart edge. Use within 24 hours. For the Margarita Sol: Carefully run the wedge of lime around the inside rim of a 12-ounce tumbler (for rocks) or a 10-ounce martini glass, then dunk the glass onto a saucer of kosher salt to create a thin line of salt around the inside rim only. Shake off excess. Combine the tequila, sour mix, liqueur, and orange juice in a glass shaker filled with ice. Cap tightly, shake vigorously for 15 seconds, and strain over fresh ice cubes into the rocks glass, or straight up into the martini glass.
