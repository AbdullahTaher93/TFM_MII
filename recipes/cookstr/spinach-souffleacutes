Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cook the spinach according to package directions until tender. Allow to cool, squeeze dry, and chop very fine. Set aside. Place the onion and the margarine or butter in a 2-quart pot. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft. Set aside. Place the milk, flour, pepper, and nutmeg in a pint-size jar with a tight-fitting lid, and shake until smooth. Add the milk mixture to the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the Swiss and Parmesan cheeses to the milk mixture, and stir until melted. Stir in the reserved spinach. Place the egg yolks in a small bowl (reserve the whites), and stir in about ½ cup of the spinach mixture. Return the spinach mixture to the pot and stir to mix well. Set aside. Place the egg whites in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer just until stiff peaks form when the beaters are raised. Fold a fourth of the egg whites into the spinach mixture. Then gently fold the spinach mixture into the remaining whipped egg whites. Spoon the souffle mixture into six ungreased 6-ounce custard cups or ramekins, and arrange them on a large baking sheet for easier handling. Bake for about 20 minutes or until the soufflés are golden brown, puffy, and set. Serve immediately. For a Change: • Top the baked soufflés with alfredo sauce, hollandaise sauce, or roasted red pepper sauce. • Substitute 1 cup of very finely chopped soft-cooked broccoli or cauliflower for the spinach. • Substitute Cheddar cheese for the Swiss, and replace the nutmeg with a pinch of ground cayenne pepper. • Add ½ cup finely ground lean baked ham along with the spinach in Step 5. • To serve the soufflés as an entree, divide the mixture among four 12-ounce ramekins (instead of the smaller custard cups) and bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden brown, puffy, and set.
