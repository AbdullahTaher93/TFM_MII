Dredge lamb in flour, and set aside. Combine garlic, onions, and butter in a very large skillet. Stir over medium heat until onions are lightly browned. Add floured lamb and cook until lightly browned all over, stirring as needed to brown evenly. Add apples, curry powder, brown sugar, raisins, Worcestershire sauce, lemon slices, coconut, black walnuts, lime peel, salt, and water. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer about 1 hour, or until meat is fork-tender. Serve curry with rice and your choice of condiments.
