Run the beans through your hands to pick out any small stones or pieces of earth, which can be found in even the best of brands. Rinse twice in cold water and drain. Put into a bean pot and cover with enough hot water to come at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) above the beans. Add the onion and lard and bring to a simmer. Continue simmering until the skins of the beans are soft, then add the salt and continue cooking until the beans are very soft and the broth soupy (see Notes). Frijoles de olla are usually served alone at the end of the main course, sometimes on the same plate and mopped up with a tortilla, or often in a small bowl apart. Do not soak the beans first; the skin gives off an unpleasant flavor. If you do, then donâ€™t throw out the soaking water with all the minerals and flavor. Instead throw out the book that tells you to do so. Do not add the salt until the skins of the beans are soft; some Mexican cooks will say that the skins will toughen. Always use the bean broth-again, throw out the book that tells you to discard it (believe it or not, I have seen these instructions). Do not leave the beans at room temperature for any length of time; they ferment easily.
