In a large skillet on medium heat sweat the garlic and the bacon until the bacon turns translucent and the fat renders out. Grate the nutmeg into the pan, add the spinach, stir and cover. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the leaves begin to wilt. Add the sour cream and cheese and stir combine. Top with a bit more fresh grated Parmesan cheese and enjoy!
