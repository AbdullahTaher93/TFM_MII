Preheat the oven to 450° F. Season the trout inside and out with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, sage, and parsley, and blend well. Divide the mixture into four equal parts, spread one portion inside each opened trout, and close the fish as you would a book. Rub a large baking dish with the olive oil, and arrange the trout comfortably within it. Add ½ cup of the wine and bake 10 minutes, basting occasionally and gradually adding the remaining wine to compensate for evaporation. Drain the liquid into a small nonreactive saucepan, and cover the trout to keep them warm. Boil the cooking liquid until emulsified and reduced, about 5 minutes. With a spatula, carefully transfer the fish to a serving platter or individual dishes, strain, and spoon the reduced sauce over them.
