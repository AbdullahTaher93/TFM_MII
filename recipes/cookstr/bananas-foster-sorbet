METHOD Melt the butter in large saut√© pan over high heat. Add the brown sugar, and as it starts to melt, add the bananas. Reduce the heat to medium and stir the bananas around frequently as they begin to soften. Add the lime zest and continue to cook until the bananas have caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the rum, ignite (carefully), and allow the flame to burn out. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool completely. (At this point, you could serve it as-is, as Bananas Foster.) Place the cooled bananas and all the cooking liquid into a bar blender or food processor and process until smooth, adding cold water slowly as needed to facilitate the blending. Season with lime juice and salt, then transfer the mixture to a shallow freezable container. Covet loosely with plastic or waxed paper and place in the freezer. Stir the mixture every 30 minutes until it starts to hold its shape. In about 4 hours it will have attained a scoopable consistency. Scoop into chilled glasses or bowls and serve with caramel sauce, toasted coconut, warm grilled pineapple, rum cake, snickerdoodle cookies, or coconut macaroons.
