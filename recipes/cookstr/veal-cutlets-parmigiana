Beat the eggs and milk or cream together lightly. Mix the breadcrumbs with salt and pepper, and the basil and cheese. Dip the cutlets in flour, then in the beaten egg and milk, and finally in the crumb mixture, place them between sheets of wax paper and refrigerate while you prepare the tomato sauce. Blanch and peel the garlic and combine with the tomato purée, tomato paste, and seasonings. Bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. Correct the seasoning and add a small amount of sugar if the sauce is too acidic. Remove the cutlets from the refrigerator. Heat enough oil in a heavy 12 or 14 inch skillet to cover the bottom to a depth of ¼ inch. Cook the cutlets quickly, being careful not to burn the breading. When nicely browned on one side, turn carefully with the aid of a spatula and brown the other side. Salt and pepper the cutlets during cooking. Spread a layer of tomato sauce in an ovenproof serving dish and arrange the cutlets on the sauce. Spoon additional sauce over the cutlets. Place a large thin slice of mozzarella or jack cheese atop each cutlet and sprinkle well with Parmesan. Place in a 400-degree oven to melt the cheese and heat the cutlets and sauce. Serve at once along with buttered green noodles, sprinkled with grated cheese, and a crisp green salad.
