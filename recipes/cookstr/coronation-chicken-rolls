Heat the oil in a small frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the shallot and cook for about 2 minutes until softened but not browned. Add the curry powder and stir for 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce. Remove from heat and let cool. Process the shallot mixture, mayonnaise, and drained apricot halves in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the chicken. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Spoon the chicken salad onto the rolls, and sprinkle with the chopped parsley. Variation: Egg Salad Rolls: Substitute 4 chopped, hard-boiled eggs for the chicken. If desired, add the grated zest of 1 lemon.
