Heat the oven to 500° F. Place the bell peppers in the oven and roast until charred all around, about 25 minutes. Remove the peppers to a paper bag, twist to seal, and let the peppers steam in the bag for 15 minutes. Peel the peppers with your fingers and a paring knife and remove the seeds. In a food processor or using a chef’s knife, mince the bell peppers, garlic, chilies, and pine nuts. Transfer to a bowl. Add the cilantro, salt, and water and stir to mix. Serve right away, or cover, refrigerate, and use within 1 week.
