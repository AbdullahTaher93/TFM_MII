For the risotto: In a medium saucepan, heat the chicken stock and the dry mushrooms, if using, over medium heat until the stock is simmering and the mushrooms are soft. Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms and simmer just until they are soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and keep the broth at a low simmer. In a heavy medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat and sauté the rice for 1 minute. Add ¼ cup of the simmering mushroom broth and mushrooms to the rice, stirring until it is incorporated. Continue stirring and adding broth ¼ cup at a time until about half the broth and mushrooms have been incorporated. Keep the rice at a gentle simmer. Add the remaining liquid ½ cup at a time, stirring until most has been incorporated before adding more. When all the broth and mushrooms have been added, reduce the heat to low and simmer 5 minutes. Taste the rice for doneness. It should have some bite, but not be too hard. If it is not done al dente, stir in additional stock, as needed. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter and season with salt and pepper. For the squab: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until almost smoking. Season the squab pieces with salt and pepper and place in the pan skin-side down. Sear until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, and turn. Cook the legs an additional 3 to 4 minutes and the breasts an additional 5 minutes, and remove from the pan. The squab will be rare to medium-rare; cook slightly longer for medium. Allow the squab to rest at room temperature 3 to 4 minutes before serving. To serve: Stir the risotto and divide among 6 warm plates. Arrange the squab around the risotto. Variations: Drizzle risotto with Chive Oil. If necessary, substitute domestic for wild mushrooms. For risotto, substitute Pasta with Wild Mushrooms or Wild Rice with Pine Nuts.
