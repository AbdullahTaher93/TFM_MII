Cut the ribs apart. Coat them on all sides with most of the barbecue sauce and sprinkle with salt and pepper: set the remaining sauce aside. Arrange the ribs in a steamer basket; you can stand them somewhat vertically to get them to fit. Set aside. Heat the pressure cooker base on medium heat, add the oil, and heat briefly. Stir in the onion and saut√© until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the water, beans, and bay leaf and stir. Lower the rib-filled steamer basket into the pressure cooker and then close and lock the lid. Cook at high pressure (see Notes) for 20 minutes/stovetop or 23 to 25 minutes/ electric (or nonstandard stovetop), When the time is up, open the pressure cooker with the 10-Minute Natural Release method (see Notes). Set the upturned lid of the cooker on your countertop. Carefully lift the steamer basket out of the cooker and place it on the lid; cover with aluminum foil. Fish out and discard the bay leaf from the beans, and mix in 1 teaspoon salt, the garlic, and spinach. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the bean mixture into a large casserole (big enough to hold the ribs in one layer) with low sides. Using tongs, arrange the ribs on top of the beans and brush with the remaining barbecue sauce. Turn on the broiler. Broil the casserole until the sauce on the ribs is lightly caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
