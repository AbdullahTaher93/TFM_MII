In a medium saucepan bring the chicken stock to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the spinach leaves, if using, sesame oil, and salt allowing the spinach to wilt into the soup. Stir well until the chicken broth is swirling in circles. Carefully and slowly pour the beaten eggs onto the surface of the soup continuing to stir gently and encouraging them to flow out into leafy petals and ribbons. Sprinkle the green onion onto the soup and serve hot.
