Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Stir in a small fistful of salt and the farfalle and boil until the pasta is tender. While the pasta is cooking, melt the butter with a tablespoon or two of water in a large frying pan over low heat. Add the scallions and sauté them for a minute or two, until they soften. Add the peas, ham, and salt and pepper to taste, and a small ladleful of hot pasta water, and cook until the peas are tender. Add a splash more hot pasta water as you’re cooking if the vegetables are sticking to the pan. Taste for salt and pepper. Keep warm, and when the pasta is almost done, transfer to a pasta bowl. Reserve a cupful of the pasta water and drain the pasta quickly in a colander. Turn the pasta into the serving bowl on top of the peas and scallion condimento. Toss, adding a splash of hot pasta water if necessary. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese, and serve hot with more Parmesan at the table.
