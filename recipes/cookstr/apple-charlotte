Combine the apples, ½ cup of the sugar, raisins, and lemon zest and juice in a heavy saucepan. Cover and cook over low heat for 8–10 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the apples are very tender and beginning to fall apart. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush the inside of the pan with some of the butter. Remove the crusts from the bread, then cut the bread into 14 slices. Brush both sides of each bread slice with butter. Mix together the remaining 3 tbsp sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle over one side of the bread. Place 3 slices of bread, sugared side down, in the bottom of the pan, trimming to fit. Cut 8 slices in half, and slightly overlap them, sugared side out, to line the sides of the pan. Spoon the apple mixture into the bread shell. Cover with the remaining bread slices, sugared side up, trimming to fit as necessary. Fold over the bread slices on the side of the pan to slightly overlap the top of the charlotte. Bake 30–35 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Let stand for 5 minutes, then remove the sides of the pan. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar and serve warm.
