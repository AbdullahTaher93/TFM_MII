In a small saucepan, bring the lobster stock to a boil over high heat and reduce it to 1/3 cup, about 15 to 18 minutes. It will be thick and syrupy. Be careful not to let it burn. Strain through a fine strainer and cool. In a medium bowl, Whisk the salt with the vinegar until the salt is dissolved. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Add the lobster syrup and season with pepper. Taste, and add more pepper, salt, or vinegar, if needed. Variation: Combine with chopped fresh herbs, a drizzle of Basil Oil or Chive Oil.
