Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C) Remove giblets and neck from chicken. Rinse and pat chicken dry inside and out. Place 2 cloves garlic inside cavity. Starting at cavity opening, gently lift skin and rub thyme, salt and pepper over breasts and legs. Tie legs together with string; tuck wings under back. Add remaining garlic, 2/3 cup (150 mL) chicken broth and wine to roasting pan; place chicken, breast side up, on rack in pan. Roast in preheated oven, basting every 30 minutes, adding additional broth if pan juices evaporate, for 1 ¾ to 2 hours or until pan juices run clear when chicken is pierced and meat thermometer inserted in thigh registers 185°F (85°C). Transfer to a platter; tent with foil and let stand for 10 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, strain pan juices into measure, pressing down firmly to mash garlic into juices; skim off fat. Add enough of the remaining broth to make ¾ cup (175 mL). In a small saucepan, stir together 2 tbsp (25 mL) of pan juices and flour; cook, stirring, over medium heat for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in remaining pan juices; cook, stirring, until boiling and thickened. Serve with chicken.
