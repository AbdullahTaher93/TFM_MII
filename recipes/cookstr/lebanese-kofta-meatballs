Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Divide kofta meat into 20 small balls. Put on a nonstick rimmed cookie sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Flip meatballs every 10 minutes for even cooking. Remove and set aside. In a large pot, heat oil, add onion, and fry until lightly browned. Add garlic and fry gently for 2 more minutes. Add tomatoes, pomegranate syrup, and water, and stir together. Gently cook for 10 minutes, then carefully add the meatballs and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Cover and cook over low heat for 20 more minutes or until mixture thickens. Serve hot with cooked rice.
