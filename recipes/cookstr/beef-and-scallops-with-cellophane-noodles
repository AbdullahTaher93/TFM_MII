Prepare the cellophane noodles early in the day. Do not soak them. Just break them apart and deep-fry in oil heated to 375Â° for a few seconds until they puff up. Drain on paper towels. Heat the oil in a skillet. Add the beef, scallops, and garlic all at once and cook over high heat, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add the scallions, salt, pepper, and dried red pepper. Cook for another 30 seconds, stirring furiously, and pour over a platter holding the fried cellophane noodles.
