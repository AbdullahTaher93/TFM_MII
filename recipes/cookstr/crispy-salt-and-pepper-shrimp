Rinse the shrimp and pat dry. In a large bowl, combine the shrimp with the wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, and Â½ teaspoon salt. Let the shrimp marinate for 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the shrimp and pat dry; discard the marinade. Toss the shrimp in the cornstarch. Heat several inches of vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Carefully drop the shrimp into the oil in batches. The shrimp should cook through in 50 to 60 seconds (the shells will turn bright pink). Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the oil in the wok. Add the salt, chili, garlic, peppercorn, five-spice powder, and 1 teaspoon salt to the oil, still over medium-high heat. Stir the seasonings into the oil for 1 minute. Return the shrimp to the wok and toss to combine for 30 seconds. Serve immediately.
