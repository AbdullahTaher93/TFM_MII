Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the onions and brown them slightly. Add the peppers, eggplant, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until softened. Place the cooked vegetables in the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the zucchini and tomato slices on top, overlapping in rows. Sprinkle with savory and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the dish from the oven, sprinkle the top with the Parmesan, drizzle with the remaining olive oil, and bake for 15 minutes. You can also scatter bread-crumbs and cheese over the top.
