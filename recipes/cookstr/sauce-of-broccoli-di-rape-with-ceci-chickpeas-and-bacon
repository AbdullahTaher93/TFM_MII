Start cooking the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water 5 minutes before you begin the sauce if you are using dry pasta, or just after, if using fresh pasta. Pour 1/3 cup of the olive oil into a big skillet. Toast the peperoncino for ½ minute; stir in with the garlic and bacon or prosciutto. Cook for another 2½ minutes or more, shaking the pan and stirring now and then, until the bacon has rendered its fat and is crisping. Pour the ceci into the skillet, and ladle in 2 cups of hot water from the pasta-cooking pot. Stir briefly, and bring the liquid to a boil. Dump the broccoli di rape pieces on top of the other ingredients, place a cover on the pan, and let the greens steam and wilt for a minute or so. Uncover, and stir in the broccoli di rape and another 1½ tablespoons of the olive oil. Lower the heat to maintain an active simmer, and cook the sauce, covered, for 6 to 8 minutes, until the beans and greens are quite tender. (You can start cooking dry pasta at this time too.) Uncover the pan and taste the sauce; add salt if you wish. If the sauce seems soupy, raise the heat and cook until there’s only a shallow layer of liquid around the vegetables. Keep the sauce barely simmering until the pasta is ready. When the pasta is done almost al dente, scoop it up and into the skillet to finish cooking. Add the parsley during the initial tossing; off the heat, toss in the cheese and the remaining olive oil just before serving.
