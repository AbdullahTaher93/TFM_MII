First make the dough thoroughly combine 250 gram all-purpose flour with the sugar, the yeast, and the salt. Heat the milk, the butter and the vanilla in a small saucepan over medium heat until the butter has just melted. Allow it to cool somewhat. Add the lukewarm milk butter mixture to the dry ingredients and, using a stand mixer with dough hooks, knead everything into a firm dough. Then, one by one, stir in the eggs and continue whisking until everything is mixed and the dough has become very smooth. Now add the rest of the flour and, with flour dusted hands, knead the dough on the kitchen counter until it's soft and supple. Go on kneading for at least 8 minutes. If needed, you can add some more liquid (milk or water) or flour until the dough is no longer sticky. Form into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Cover with cling wrap and set aside at a warm spot for at least an hour to let it rise. Meanwhile you can combine the butter, sugar, and cinnamon into a spreadable paste. Once teh dough has doubled in volume, you can remove it from the bowl and, on a flour dusted countertop, roll it out into a large flat rectangle of 40 by 24 cm. Using a spatula, spread the cinnamon butter out over the entire dough rectangle. Then, using the back of a knife, slice the dough lengthwise into 4 or 6 long strips. Stack them and cut them into squares. Stack the dough squares inside a well greased 1.5 liter baking pan. This should be done somewhat loosely, leaving the bread some room to rise. Again cover with some wrap and allow it to rise for another 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 170°C. Mae sure the top heating (broiler) is turned off. Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes. If the top is browning too fast you can cover it loosely with some aluminum foil. Preheat the oven to 170°C. Mae sure the top heating (broiler) is turned off. Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes.
