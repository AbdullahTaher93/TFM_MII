Preheat the oven to 350°F and butter a freezer-proof 10-inch deep-dish pie plate. Press the crumb mixture over the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate. Bake for 10 minutes or until set. Cool. Soften the coffee ice cream (see Notes) and spread into the cooled crust. Place in the freezer to harden for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, soften 1 pint of the chocolate ice cream in a large bowl. Stir in the marshmallows and pecans. Spread on top of the coffee layer. Cover and freeze 15 minutes more. Scoop the remaining 2 pints chocolate ice cream on top of the pie, mounding the scoops high in the center to resemble a "bed of rocks." Wrap and freeze for at least 2 hours. Store in the freezer. To slice, let the pie stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes (see Baker’s Tip in Notes). Meanwhile, chop the chocolate for the Hot Fudge Sauce. In a heavy saucepan, heat the cream, com syrup, and salt over medium heat just until bubbles start to form around the edge (do not boil). Add the chocolate, butter, and vanilla and heat, stirring constantly, until smooth. To serve, spoon a little of the hot sauce onto the bottom of each dessert plate. Top with a slice of pie and drizzle more sauce over the top.
