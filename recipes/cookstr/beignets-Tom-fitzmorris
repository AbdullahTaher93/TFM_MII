Combine the flour and Crisco in a bowl with a wire whisk until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, with perhaps a few lumps here and there. Warm ¾ cup of water in the microwave oven until barely warm to the touch. Pour the water into a large bowl, add the sugar, and stir until dissolved. Add the flour mixture and blend it with kitchen fork. Work the dough as little as possible. Turn the dough out on a clean counter and dust with a little flour. Roll it out to a uniform thickness of about ¼ inch. Cut into rectangles about 2 x 4 inches. Let sit for a couple of minutes while you heat the oil. Pour oil to a depth of 1 inch in a large, deep skillet and heat to about 325 degrees. When the beignet dough squares have softened and puffed up a little, drop 4-6 at a time into the hot oil and fry until light brown. Turn once and fry the other side. Drain on paper towels. It’s all right to fry the misshapen dough pieces from the edge of the dough sheet. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and serve hot.
