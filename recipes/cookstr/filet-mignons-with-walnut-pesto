To make the walnut pesto, toast the walnuts in a 350°F (170°C) oven for 10 minutes. Let cool. Transfer to a food processor and add the Parmesan, garlic, tarragon, parsley, and vinegar. With the machine running, add the oil to make a coarse paste. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a ridged frying pan over high heat. Lightly brush the steaks with oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook the steaks in the pan for about 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Transfer to dinner plates and serve hot, with a dollop of the walnut pesto.
