Place the garlic and jalapeño in a food processor and chop very fine. Add the tomatillos and scallions and process until finely chopped but not puréed. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in 1/3 cup water and the remaining ingredients. Allow to stand for about 30 minutes, then adjust the seasoning and serve.
