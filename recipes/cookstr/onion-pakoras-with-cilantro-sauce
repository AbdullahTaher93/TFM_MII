To make the sauce, combine the cilantro, vinegar, olive oil, jalapeño, coriander, and salt in a mini food processor or blender and process until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Transfer to a small serving bowl and set aside. (The sauce can be made up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated, covered.) Use a whisk to stir together the chickpea flour, cilantro, cumin, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Whisk in the water to form a smooth batter. Set aside for 10 minutes. While the batter is sitting, pour about 2 inches of oil into a large heavy saucepan (the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pan). Bring to 365°F over medium heat. Use a wooden spoon to stir the batter, then add the onion, stirring well to evenly blend. Scoop up a heaping tablespoon of the onion mixture and gently add it to the hot oil. Repeat to form 4 or 5 more pakoras and fry until nicely browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes, gently turning the pakoras once or twice for even cooking. If they brown too quickly, the inside risks not being cooked through; reduce the oil temperature a bit if needed. Lift out the pakoras with a slotted spoon and set aside on paper towels to drain while frying the remaining batter. Arrange the pakoras on a plate or platter with the sauce alongside for dipping.
