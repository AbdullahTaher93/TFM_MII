In a small bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, black pepper, curry powder, and lime juice. Brush the steaks with this marinade and allow them to rest for 15 minutes, turning once. Light the grill or oven broiler. In a large skillet over high heat, combine the peanut oil, chili powder, and green pepper. Saut√© for 1 minute, lower the heat to medium, stir in the water and black-eyed peas, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes, stir well, and add the green onion. Set aside to cool. The chili should be served at room temperature. Grill or broil the steaks for 3 minutes per side, turning only once for rare. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before spooning the black-eyed pea chili over them.
