In a large zip-top bag, combine the minced garlic, cilantro, ¼ cup of the fish sauce, the pepper, curry powder, and 1 cup of the coconut milk. Add the chicken thighs, close the bag, and squish the marinade to coat the chicken. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours. While the chicken is marinating, make the dipping sauce. Take a medium saucepan and add the curry paste, paprika, garlic paste, peanut butter, tamarind, brown sugar, peanuts, the remaining 2 tablespoons fish sauce, and the remaining 2 cups coconut milk. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring to blend the ingredients. Let the sauce cook until thickened and reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. The sauce can be served warm or at room temperature. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before you plan to cook. Pull the chicken thighs from the marinade and pat dry. Pour the remaining marinade into a small saucepan. Bring to a full boil over high heat and let boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool. Place the chicken on the grill and close the lid. The chicken will need to cook for 25 to 35 minutes. You want to turn the pieces frequently and baste with the reserved marinade. About halfway through the cooking time, you will need to reduce the temperature of your burners to medium so that the thighs don’t turn into crispy bits of carbon. During the last 5 minutes or so, do not baste with the marinade. When the thighs are firm to the touch and an instant-read thermometer hits 165°F to 170°F, remove the thighs to a platter. Let rest for about 5 minutes, and then serve with the dipping sauce and lime wedges on the side.
