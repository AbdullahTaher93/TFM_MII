Heat the Onion-Garlic Puree in a small saucepan over medium heat. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the milk into the cornstarch. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the onion-garlic puree. Raise the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly. Then reduce the heat to low and continue to cook the sauce until it has thickened, about 1 minute. Add the cheese and the nutmeg to the sauce and whisk until melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, or store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
