Preheat the oven to 450°F. Butter four small gratin dishes and put them on a baking sheet. Break 2 eggs into each. Scatter the chopped herbs and tomatoes over them. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon the cream on to cover the surface evenly. Bake just until set, 8 to 10 minutes; don’t overcook. Remove from the oven and turn on the broiler. Place the eggs under the broiler for a moment to brown lightly. Serve immediately, setting each gratin dish on a plate or doubled napkin. Give each eater a soupspoon.
