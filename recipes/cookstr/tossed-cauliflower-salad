Bring a large saucepan of salted boiling water to a boil over high heat. Trim core from cauliflower. Cut enough into 1- to 1Â½-inch florets to measure 6 cups. Cook cauliflower at a medium boil until nicely tender but not falling apart, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well. Place in large bowl and while still warm, toss gently first with vinegar, then cream, using a rubber spatula. Toss with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and red pepper flakes to taste. Serve warm or at room temperature sprinkled with basil. Variation: Replace the basil with fresh or dried mint or oregano.
