Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and celery, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the eggplant, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant begins to soften, about 5 more minutes. Transfer the mixture to a 4-quart slow cooker. Add the bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, vinegar, sugar, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook on Low until the vegetables are soft but still hold some shape, about 6 hours. When the vegetables are cooked, stir in the olives, capers, and parsley. Taste to adjust the seasonings. Transfer the caponata to a bowl and let cool. Serve at room temperature. If not serving right away, cover and refrigerate until needed.
