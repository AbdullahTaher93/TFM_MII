Soak the wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Cut the chicken into 2 × ½-inch strips. In a glass or plastic bowl, mix the vegetable oil, wine, ginger, cornstarch, salt, soy sauce, sugar, pepper, and sesame oil. Add the chicken and stir. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the broiler. Thread 3 chicken strips onto each skewer. Repeat the procedure until all the skewers are prepared. Broil about 4 inches from the heat, turning once, until done, about 5 minutes.
