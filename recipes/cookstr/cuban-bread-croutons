In a heavy skillet, heat about Â½ inch of oil. When the oil is hot enough that a small cube of bread sizzles when dropped in the oil, add 2 or 3 of the bread slices at a time and fry, turning once, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the croutons with a slotted spatula and drain well on paper towels.
