In the bowl of a food processor, grind the ginger and garlic into a smooth, watery paste. Transfer the paste into a large mixing bowl. Add the yogurt, Tandoori Masala, salt, red chile powder, and Garam Masala and whisk until fully combined. Prepare the chicken by poking holes in it with a fork to help it absorb the yogurt marinade. Carefully add the pieces of chicken and gently stir until all the pieces are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours to overnight. Preheat the grill to medium-high (350°F /180°C to 400°F /200°C), making sure the grill has been well oiled or sprayed with a nonstick cooking or grilling spray. Place the marinated pieces of chicken on the grill and cook, turning once to ensure even cooking, for up to 1 hour, until cooked through and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F /74°C. Your cooking time may differ, depending on your grill and how well done you prefer the chicken to be. We prefer it well done, Remove from the grill and transfer to a serving platter. Squeeze the ½ lemon over the cooked chicken. Sprinkle with some of the Garam Masala. Garnish with the onion and cilantro and serve hot over the brown or white basmati rice or with the Roti or Naan.
