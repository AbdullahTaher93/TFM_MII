Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). In a small saucepan, over medium-high heat, sauté cranberries, sugar, orange zest and orange juice until berries pop. Mash lightly with a fork. Meanwhile, in a skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Sauté onion until tender. Stir in cranberry mixture, turkey, salt and pepper; let cool. Use the puff pastry sheets to form 8 turnovers, using the turkey mixture as filling. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until browned and puffed.
