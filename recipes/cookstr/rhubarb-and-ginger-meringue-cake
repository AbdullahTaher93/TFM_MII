Prepare ahead The meringues can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week. The filling can be refrigerated 1 day in advance. Preheat the oven to 350째F (180째C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. One tablespoon at a time, beat in the sugar until the whites are stiff. Spread the meringue on the baking sheets into two 7in (18cm) circles. Bake for 5 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 250째F (130째C) and bake for 1 hour, until crisp. Cool completely. Meanwhile, cook the rhubarb, sugar, chopped ginger, ground ginger, and 2 tbsp water in a large covered saucepan over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, or until tender. Let cool. If too liquid, drain off some of the juices. Refrigerate for 2 hours. Whip the cream until stiff peaks form and fold in the rhubarb. Spread 1 meringue with the rhubarb cream and top with the remaining meringue. Dust with confectioner's sugar and serve.
