In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, ginger, lemongrass, half of the chile, lemon zest, and fish sauce (if using). Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let infuse for an additional 10 minutes. Strain, pushing down on the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Add lemon juice and set aside. Finely mince the remaining half of the chile. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute chile, garlic, and shallot in vegetable and sesame oil until tender. Deglaze pan with white wine and cook until reduced by half. Increase the heat to high; add mussels, coconut-lemongrass milk, and basil. Season with salt and shake the pan to distribute the ingredients. Cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, just until the mussels open. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
