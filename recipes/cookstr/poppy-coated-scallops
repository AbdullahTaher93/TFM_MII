Mix the panko, poppy seeds, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon salt, and the pepper in a shallow bowl. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites and the pinch of salt with a fork until they loosen. One at a time, dip the scallops into the egg whites, allowing the excess to drip back into the bowl. Roll each scallop in the poppy seed mixture to coat. Line the scallops up in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour enough of the oil into a medium skillet to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Heat over medium heat until rippling. Slip 6 scallops into the pan and cook, turning once with tongs, until lightly browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining scallops. Serve warm. (Cooked scallops can be kept warm on the baking sheet in a 200Â°F oven while you cook the remaining scallops.)
