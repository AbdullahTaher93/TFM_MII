Poach the tempeh in simmering water for 30 minutes. Drain and cut into Â½-inch strips. Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tempeh and cook until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, hoisin sauce, and chile oil. Pour the mixture onto the tempeh and set aside. Cook the noodles according to package directions. About 3 minutes before the noodles are done, add the carrots to the pot and finish cooking. Drain the noodles and carrots well, and add to the tempeh mixture. Add the scallions, cilantro, and peanuts, tossing gently to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more chile oil if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.
