In a large bowl, mix the sunflower seeds, coconut, wheat germ, ground flaxseed, nuts and oats. In a small bowl, combine corn syrup, oil, vanilla and almond or coconut extract. Add the syrup mixture to the dry ingredients. Make sure any wet lumps are well blended in. Place granola in a large casserole dish and bake on middle rack at 350°F (180°C) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until slightly toasted. During baking, remove the pan from the oven every 10 minutes and stir, so that the granola cooks evenly. Once toasted, remove from the oven and right away transfer to a metal bowl or pot; otherwise, the granola may stick to the bottom of the hot pan as it sits to cool. Stir once or twice as it’s cooling. Once cooled, add cereal and raisins. Store in an airtight container.
