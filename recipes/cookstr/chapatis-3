Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl and stir together. Add water a bit at a time until the dough holds together. Turn out onto a floured board and knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a small floured bowl and cover with a dean tea towel. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Heat a small nonstick skillet coated with cooking oil spray. Roll out each ball of dough into a thin round, about 5 inches in diameter. Cook one at a time on the skillet over medium heat until touched with light brown spots, about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side; repeat with the other balls of dough. Keep the chapatis warm, stacked one atop another in foil, until all are done. Serve at once.
