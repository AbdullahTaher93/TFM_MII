In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add carrots and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in green onions. Gradually stir in broth. Add bay leaf and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes or until the carrots are almost tender. Return soup to a boil. Add noodles, chicken and peas; simmer, uncovered, for 3 to 5 minutes until chicken is heated through and noodles are tender. Remove bay leaf and season to taste. To freeze: Let soup cool. Ladle into freezer containers. Seal, label and date. Freeze for up to 3 months. To serve: Thaw soup in microwave or in refrigerator overnight. From Rose Murray: Quick Chicken
