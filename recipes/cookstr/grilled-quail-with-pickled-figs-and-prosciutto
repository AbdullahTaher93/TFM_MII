Prepare a charcoal fire (using mesquite charcoal, if possible) or preheat the broiler. Brush the quail with the olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Grill the quail, breast-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and continue cooking until nicely browned, 4 minutes or so. Alternatively, put the quail, skin-side up, on a baking sheet and broil until crisp on the outside, 4 minutes or so. Turn and continue broiling for another 3 minutes or until done. The quail should be slightly pink and juicy inside. Donâ€™t overcook. Wrap each pickled fig with a slice of prosciutto and serve alongside the quail. In a medium nonreactive pot, put the sugar, red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, ginger, lemon, and peppercorns. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Add the figs, cover, and continue simmering for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the figs cool in the syrup. (The figs can be prepared to this point and stored in their syrup in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.) Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the figs, reserving the poaching syrup for another use.
