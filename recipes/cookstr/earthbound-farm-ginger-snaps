Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. 2 baking sheets with parchment paper waxed paper and set them aside. Place the butter and 1 cup of the in a medium-size mixing bowl. Beat an electric mixer at medium speed smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg molasses and beat until combined, 1 minute. Whisk together the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until the dough is smooth. Roll pieces of the dough between your palms to form 1-inch balls. Lightly dip the tops of the balls in the remaining ½ cup of sugar. Arrange the dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, sugar side up, 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies until they are very fragrant and cracks appear on top, 8 to 12 minutes. Place the baking sheets on a wire rack cool for 5 minutes. Then, using a spatula, remove the cookies from the baking sheet and place them directly on the rack to finish cooling. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container for 1 month.
