Combine the sugar and water in a heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves. Boil without stirring until the syrup turns a deep golden brown, occasionally brushing down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush and swirling the pan, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the cream (the mixture will bubble vigorously). Using a whisk, stir over low heat until smooth. Cool to lukewarm before serving.
