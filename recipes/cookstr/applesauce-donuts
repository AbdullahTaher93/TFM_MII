In a bowl, whisk together 3 cups (750 mL) of the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, baking soda and allspice. Set aside. In mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment, combine brown sugar, eggs, applesauce, milk and butter. On low speed, mix until well combined. Add dry ingredients and mix until incorporated. Gradually mix in more of the remaining flour, as necessary, until dough starts to come together and is the consistency of biscuit dough. Cover and refrigerate for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large, deep pot or deep fryer, heat about 4 inches (10 cm) oil over medium heat until temperature registers 360°F (182°C) (see Tip, left). On a floured work surface, roll out dough to slightly thicker than ¼ inch (0.5 cm). If dough is tacky, dust with additional flour. Cut dough with cutter into 22 donuts (or cut with a knife or pizza cutter into 5- by 2-inch/12.5 by 5 cm rectangles), re-rolling scraps as necessary. Place at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on prepared baking sheet. Deep-fry 3 to 4 donuts at a time in hot oil, turning once with wooden chopsticks, until golden brown, about 25 seconds per side. Using a slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to absorb excess oil. Fry remaining donuts, adjusting heat as necessary between batches to maintain oil temperature. Toss warm donuts with Autumn Spiced Sugar, if using, or let cool completely prior to icing. Finishing suggestions Icings: Autumn Spiced Sugar
