Peel the pears, leaving the stems attached. Cut a small slice from the bottom of each so that the pears will stand up. Stir the wine, sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large saucepan over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Add the pears to the saucepan and cover. Simmer, frequently turning and basting the pears, for 20 minutes, or until the pears are tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pears to a deep serving dish. Discard the cinnamon stick and cloves. Boil until the wine mixture is syrupy and reduced by about one-third. Pour the syrup over the pears. Serve warm or let cool in the syrup and refrigerate until chilled. Variation: Pears in White Wine Substitute white wine or cider for the red wine, and the result will be paler and more golden in color. Choose a sweet white wine or cider.
