Cook potatoes in boiling, salted water for 30 minutes, or until tender. Drain and, using a potato masher, food mill, fork, or food processor, purée, adding all ingredients gradually. If using a processor, put potatoes and all ingredients in processor bowl simultaneously and pulse machine on and off quickly, or potatoes will have a gluey-starchy consistency. VARIATIONS Saffron Potatoes: Dissolve 1½ teaspoons of saffron threads in 1 teaspoon of hot water and stir into Potato Purée.
