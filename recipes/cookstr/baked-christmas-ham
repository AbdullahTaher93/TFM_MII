Put the ham into a pot large enough to hold it with some room left over, then fill with water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 3 hours, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface from time to time. Preheat the oven to 475°F/250°C (Gas Mark 9). Carefully remove the ham from the pot and pat dry, then peel off the skin, leaving a layer of fat. Stud the fat all over with cloves, spacing them as equally as possible. Put the ham on a rack in a large roasting pan, drizzle with Guinness, then sprinkle brown sugar all over the ham, packing it down with your hands to form a crust. Add additional sugar if necessary to cover. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the crust is dark golden brown.
