Heat the oven to 350°F. Place the cleaned mushrooms on a baking sheet, gill side up. Brush with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and bake for 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool on the baking sheet for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Heat a large (12- to 14-inch) sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add the shallots and the garlic and sauté, stirring, for a minute or so. Add a few handfuls of spinach, carefully turning with tongs or a spatula, and cook until wilted; add more spinach as room becomes available. Season with the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Drain the spinach in a fine-mesh strainer set in the sink, pressing on the spinach with your hands or a rubber spatula to ensure that all the liquid drains off. Set aside until cool enough to handle, and then finely chop. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the chopped spinach, breadcrumbs, mozzarella, Parmesan, and pecorino romano. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary by adding more salt and pepper. Divide the filling evenly among the baked and cooled mushrooms (about ¼ cup filling per mushroom; Love Note 5). Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the filling is hot and bubbly. To serve, place 1 mushroom on each plate and drizzle 1 tablespoon Roasted Red Pepper Coulis around each mushroom.
