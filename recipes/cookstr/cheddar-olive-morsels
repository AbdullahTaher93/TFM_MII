In a food processor, combine the flour, paprika, and salt. Add the olive brine, cheese, butter, and garlic, and process until a thick dough forms. Wrap an olive in enough dough to thoroughly cover it, making a ball about 1 to 1¼ inches in diameter. Repeat with the remaining olives and dough. Sprinkle the balls liberally with additional paprika. Set the olive balls in a shallow, smokeproof baking dish or on heavy-duty foil. Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature. Transfer the morsels to the smoker and cook until the pastry is golden brown and beginning to crisp, about 35 to 40 minutes at a temperature of 225° F to 250° F. Remove the morsels from the smoker and let them sit for 10 minutes. They will become crisper as they cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. Leftovers don’t keep well, so eat up.
