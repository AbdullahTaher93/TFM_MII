Warm the olive oil in a pan large enough to hold the Swiss chard over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until slightly colored, about 2 minutes. Add the Swiss chard, season with salt and pepper, and cook until wilted, 6 to 7 minutes. You might need to add the chard to the pan in batches. Transfer to a serving bowl.
