Place the bulgur wheat in a bowl. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil with ½ teaspoon salt. Pour this over the wheat and let wheat stand for 20 minutes, or long enough to absorb the water. After it has absorbed the water, drain off any excess thoroughly. While the wheat is softening, prepare the remaining ingredients. Seed and julienne the red peppers into ¼-inch pieces; stem and wash the spinach; cut the bean curd cakes into ½-inch dice; grate the cheese. Heat the butter in a 12-inch skillet until it is golden brown. Add the garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Add the peppers, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes over medium heat. Remove the cover and add the drained wheat and vinegar. Stir for 5 minutes, without a cover. Add the bean curd and spinach; cover and simmer, over low heat, for about another 5 minutes or until the spinach has wilted. Season very well with 1 teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. If you are too cautious at this point, the dish will taste flat. If you find the dish too moist, evaporate some of the excess water over medium heat. Stir in the cheese and remove the dish from heat when the cheese has just melted.
