Works in slow cookers from 3Â½ to 6 quarts In a colander over a sink, combine eggplant and salt. Toss and let stand for 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly under cold running water. Lay a clean tea towel on a work surface. Working in batches over the sink and using your hands, squeeze liquid out of the eggplant. Transfer to the tea towel. When batches are complete, roll the towel up and press down to remove remaining liquid. In a nonstick skillet, heat 1 tbsp (15 ml) of the oil over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add sweated eggplant, in batches, and cook until browned, adding more oil as necessary. Transfer to slow cooker stoneware. Add onions to pan, adding oil, if necessary, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and anchovies, if using, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add tomatoes with juice and tomato paste and bring to a boil. Transfer to slow cooker stoneware. Place a clean tea towel folded in half (so you will have two layers) over top of the stoneware to absorb moisture. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or on High for 4 hours, until hot and bubbly. Add roasted red peppers, olives, parsley and capers. Stir well. Cover and cook on High for 20 minutes, until heated through. To serve, ladle over hot cooked pasta or polenta.
