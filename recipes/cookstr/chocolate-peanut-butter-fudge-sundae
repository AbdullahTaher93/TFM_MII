Put all the cream, chopped chocolate, peanut butter, and golden syrup into a saucepan and put it on the heat to melt, stirring occasionally. In about 2 minutes you should have your sauce ready. Get out four sundae glasses and put a scoop of toffee or caramel ice cream in each, followed by one of chocolate and then another of vanilla. Pour over some chocolate peanut butter fudge sauce and sprinkle with salted peanuts. Hand them round.
