In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-low heat. Add onion and curry powder and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes. Stir in sweet potatoes and carrot. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Stir in broth. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add raisins and salt and cook for 5 minutes or until all vegetables are soft. Remove from heat. Using a potato masher, roughly mash sweet potato mixture. Stir in coconut milk and drained yogurt. Return to medium-high heat and heat through (do not let boil). Ladle soup into 4 bowls. Divide bell pepper evenly over each bowl. Serve immediately.
