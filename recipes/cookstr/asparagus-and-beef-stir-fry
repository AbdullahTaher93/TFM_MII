In a small bowl, stir together the stock and the soy and hoisin sauces. Set aside. Pat the beef dry with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the beef and cook, turning, until well browned but still rare, about 4 minutes. Scoop out onto a plate. Add the ginger, garlic and scallions to the pan and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the asparagus and toss until bright green, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and toss until wilted, about 1 minute. Pour in the chicken stock mixture, bring to a boil and cook until the sauce is thick enough to lightly coat the vegetables. Remove from the heat and stir in the beef to coat it with sauce. Serve immediately, drizzling sesame oil over the top if desired.
