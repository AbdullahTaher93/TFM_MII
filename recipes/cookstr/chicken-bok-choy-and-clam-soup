Rinse the chicken with cold water and set aside. Brush the clams very well under cold running water; drain well. In a medium saucepan, boil 5 cups water with the salt and ginger. Add the chicken breast and return to boiling. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit, covered, for 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the liquid and remove the skin and bones from the chicken. Slice the chicken into Â¼-inch strips across the meat; set aside. Return the broth to boiling and add the bones from the chicken breast. Cook over medium heat, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Remove the bones from the soup and add the bok choy. Boil for 1 minute. In a saucepan, while the stock is simmering, heat the vegetable oil. Add the garlic and clams and cook for 30 seconds. Add the red wine, cover, and cook for 2 minutes, or until all the clams are open (discard any clams that stay closed). Remove the clams and pour the clam cooking liquid into the soup. Bring the soup back to boiling. Turn off the heat. Pour into 4 serving bowls, place the chicken strips and 4 clams on top of each soup bowl, and garnish with the green onion.
