Mix the tahini from the bottom of the container before using it, so it will be smooth enough to blend into the sauce and effectively coat the carrots. Heat a nonstick wok or a large, deep nonstick skillet, and add the sesame oil, carrots, and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Stir-fry over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes. Cover, and cook for another 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium, and add the vinegar. Cover again, and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Stir in the honey, tahini, and garlic, and cook uncovered, stirring frequently, for 5 to 8 more minutes, or until the carrots are tender and starting to brown. At the same time, heat a second non-stick wok or skillet, and add the vegetable oil, the onion, and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Stir-fry over medium heat for 10 minutes, then add the cabbage. Keep the heat high, and stir-fry another 5 minutes or so, or until the cabbage wilts. (It will still be slightly crunchy.) Transfer to a serving platter. Spoon the carrots on top of the cabbage. Grind some black pepper over the top, and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
