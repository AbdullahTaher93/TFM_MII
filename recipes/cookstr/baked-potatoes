Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Scrub the potatoes with a vegetable brush and dry with paper towels. Rub the oil over the potato skins and sprinkle lightly with salt. Place the potatoes in a small baking pan and bake for about 1 hour, or until the potatoes feel soft to the touch. Remove from the oven, cut in half, and top with the topping of your choice. If you are using cheddar or mozzarella cheese, place the cheese-topped potatoes under the broiler for 1 minute to melt. (This is not necessary for the ricotta topping.)
