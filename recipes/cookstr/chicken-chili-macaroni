In a large skillet, cook chicken with garlic over medium high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, for 5 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink. Stir in tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili powder, oregano and cumin. Bring to a boil. Stir in macaroni and green beans; bring back to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until the pasta and beans are tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If freezing, see “to freeze” section below; otherwise proceed with step 3. Serve sprinkled with cheese. To freeze: Let pasta mixture cool. Spoon into freezer containers; seal, date and label. Freeze for up to 3 months. To serve: Thaw in microwave or in refrigerator overnight. Reheat in baking dish at 350°F (180°C) for 30 to 35 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Proceed with step 3, above.
