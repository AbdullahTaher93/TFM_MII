In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, orange zest, 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla, eggs, salt and flour. Remove the heated dish and add the blueberries straight to the dish. Sprinkle with the remaining raw sugar. Evenly distribute the milk/egg mixture over the berries. Quickly return to the oven for 35 to 40 minutes until puffed up, golden and cooked through.
