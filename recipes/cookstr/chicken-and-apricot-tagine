Heat the oil in the casserole over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, ground spices, and hot red pepper. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until the onions are softened. Stir in the stock and tomato paste, and bring to a boil, stirring. Add the dried fruits and orange juice. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat, partially cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the fruits have softened and the juices reduced slightly. Add the chicken and re-cover the casserole. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the juices run clear. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve hot.
