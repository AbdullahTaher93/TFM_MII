In a bowl, whisk together the flour, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Pour the buttermilk into another bowl. In a large heavy skillet, heat 1?2 inch of olive oil over medium heat to 325°F. Set a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Working with half of the chicken tenders at a time, dip them in the buttermilk and dredge in the flour mixture. Stir the flour mixture often to keep the bread crumbs from settling to the bottom of the bowl. Carefully place the tenders in the hot oil. Fry, turning often, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown and juices run clear. Maintain an oil temperature of 315°F to 325°F. Drain the pieces on the wire rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Serve the chicken fingers with honey mustard and sauce.
