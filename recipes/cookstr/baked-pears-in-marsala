Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Place the pears in an ovenproof dish, cut side up, and sprinkle with the Marsala, sugar, and vanilla, then pour in 1 cup of water. Tuck in the cinnamon stick. Bake uncovered for about 30 minutes, basting occasionally, until tender. Meanwhile, in a chilled bowl whip the cream, gradually adding the confectioner's sugar until firm peaks form. Serve the pears warm (or cool to room temperature and refrigerate until chilled), in their syrup, with the whipped cream. Variation: Baked Peaches, Apricots, or Plums in Marsala Substitute peeled, halved, and pitted peaches, apricots, or plums for the pears. Bake for about 25 minutes, until tender. If you don't have Marsala, or if you want a sweeter dessert, substitute medium-dry sherry or port.
