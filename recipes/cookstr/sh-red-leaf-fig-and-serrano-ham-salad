Tear the head of radicchio into manageable pieces, and toss together with the baby salad leaves. Whisk together the vinegar, oil, and salt in a small bowl and then dress the leaves. Arrange the figs and ham as artistically as you can muster over the salad and then, with a potato peeler, shave the cheese over, letting it fall lightly where it will.
