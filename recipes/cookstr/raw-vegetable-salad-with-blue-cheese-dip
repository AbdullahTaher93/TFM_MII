To prepare the dip, put the blue cheese, cream cheese, parsley, onion, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse several times, to blend. Add the remaining dip ingredients and process again, until smooth, adding salt and pepper and more lemon juice and vinegar, if needed. If the mixture seems too thick, add water 1 teaspoon at a time. Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. You can prepare this up to a day ahead. To serve, put dip in the middle of a serving platter and arrange the vegetables around it. Garnish the dip with parsley, if desired.
