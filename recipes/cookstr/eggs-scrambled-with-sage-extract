In a teacup, combine the sage and boiling water and let steep for about 30 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender. Blend on high speed for about 15 seconds. Pass the liquid through a strainer lined with cheesecloth or a paper towel. Squeeze the cloth to extract as much juice as you can. Measure out 2 teaspoons of the sage extract to add to the eggs. In a medium bowl, lightly beat together the eggs, cheese, salt, and the 2 teaspoons sage extract. In an ample skillet, warm the butter over medium heat until it is melted and hot but not brown. Immediately pour the egg mixture into the pan. With a wooden spoon, begin to mix the eggs after they have just set, as for scrambled eggs; continue to mix the eggs until they are evenly and lightly cooked. Take care not to overcook them. Turn the eggs out immediately onto a warmed plate and serve at once.
