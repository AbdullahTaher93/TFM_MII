Fill a saucepan with 6 cups of water, add the corn and some salt and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 9-12 minutes. Once cooked, take off the heat and allow the corn to cool in the liquid, then shave the kernels from the cobs, using a sharp knife, and place into a large bowl. Discard the cooking water and ears or save to make a broth. Place the sunflower oil and tarragon in a 4-cup capacity saucepan and bring to a simmer, then immediately take off the heat and add the shrimp. Leave for 5-10 minutes. You only want to slightly confit the shrimp. You can, if you like, steam the shrimp. Remove with a slotted spoon. Add the jalapeño, onion, cucumber, crème fraîche and 8 of the shrimp along with 1 teaspoon of the confit oil, lemon juice, season with salt and pepper and mix gently. Mix in half of the scallion, mint and cilantro. Arrange on a plate and top with the rest of the shrimp, scallion and herbs.
