Make the sauce: In a small jar, combine the soy sauce, mustard, sesame oil, honey, garlic, and chile-garlic paste (if using). Add 3 tablespoons of water and shake well. Prepare the vegetables and grains: In a heavy 12-inch skillet, bring ¼ cup of water to a boil over high heat. Add the dense vegetables (such as broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts), cover, and steam until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Add the quick-cooking vegetables (such as zucchini and snow peas), cover, and cook until all of the vegetables are tender but still crisp, about 2 minutes more. Add a few tablespoons more water during this time, if needed. Stir in the grains, meat (if using), and ginger. Shake the sauce and pour on enough to coat the ingredients lightly, usually ¼ to 1/3 cup. Divide among plates and serve.
