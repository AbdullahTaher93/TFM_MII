Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill/barbecue, pre-heat a gas grill/barbecue on medium-high, or place a stovetop ridged grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the tomatillos and tomatoes with the oil. Place the tomatillos and tomatoes, cut-side down, directly over the fire. Cover the grill and cook, turning once, until dark brown grill marks appear and they are tender, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into Â½-in (12-mm dice). Set aside. In a medium bowl, mash the avocados until chunky. Add the grilled tomatillos and tomatoes. Fold in the cilantro/fresh coriander, onion, serrano chiles, lime juice, and salt. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately.
