Trim the excess fat from the chicken backs and rinse them well under cold running water. Place them in a large pot and cover with the gallon of water. Place over high heat and add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil, skimming off the impurities as they rise. Adjust the heat so the liquid is at a steady simmer. Cook for 3 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Degrease the stock by ladling off the grease as it rises to the top. If you have more than 2 quarts, place the stock in a clean pot and boil until it is reduced to 2 quarts. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
