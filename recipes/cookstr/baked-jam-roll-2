Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Mix in the butter. Stir in the milk to make a stiff dough. Roll on a lightly floured work surface into a 10 × 7in (25 × 18cm) rectangle. Spread the dough with the jam. Starting from a long side, roll into a log. Lift and transfer the roll to the baking sheet, seam side down. Lightly brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the sugar. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Serve with the custard sauce. Variations Baked Syrup Roll Make the recipe as above, but use light corn or maple syrup instead of the jam. Baked Marmalade Roll Make the recipe as above, adding the grated zest of 1 orange to the dough in step 2. Use 4–6 tbsp marmalade, in place of the jam.
