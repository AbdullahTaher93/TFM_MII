To prepare the sauce, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook the coconut milk and chicken broth until hot. Whisk in the ginger, curry paste, and brown sugar. Add the lime leaves, turn down the heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. In a large bowl, toss the chicken with 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and the curry paste. Coat well. Heat a 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, then add the sliced ginger and cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken to the skillet, toss, and stir for 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, bell pepper, and garlic and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the coconut sauce to the stir-fried vegetables. Add the cooked chicken and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the sugar snap peas and toss briefly to incorporate. To serve, make a bed of cooked white or brown rice on individual plates, and top each with a portion of the stir-fry and sauce. Garnish with the cashews, green onion, cilantro, and lime wedges, and serve immediately.
