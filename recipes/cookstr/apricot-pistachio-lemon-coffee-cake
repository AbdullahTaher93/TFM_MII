Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 10-inch Bundt or tube pan. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar with a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well. Mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and yogurt. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir to blend. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing just until blended. Stir in the apricots and nuts. Spread evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then unmold right side up on a wire rack and let cool completely. Cut into slices to serve. Cherry-Hazelnut Variation: Follow the recipe above, substituting 1¼ cups dried cherries for the dried apricots and ¾ cup toasted and skinned hazelnuts (see Notes), whole or chopped, for the pistachios.
