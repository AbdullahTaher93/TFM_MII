Halve and pit the avocado. Scoop out the flesh and cut into Â¼-inch dice, then toss with the lemon juice. Toss the radicchio in a large bowl with 1 tablespoon of the sherry vinaigrette and a pinch each of sea salt and pepper. Arrange in a band on the left side of four large plates. Repeat with the endive and then the watercress, arranging a band of endive in the center of each plate and the watercress on the right side. Season the avocado with salt and pepper and arrange in a little band on top of the endive. Place a band of egg on top of the radicchio and a band of prosciutto and roasted or grilled chicken on the watercress. Scatter the tomatoes around, ladle the blue cheese dressing over, and serve.
