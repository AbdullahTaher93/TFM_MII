Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) In the bottom of a flameproof tagine, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and Berbere and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add lamb, tossing to coat with onions and spices. Cook, stirring constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes or until lamb is browned on all sides. Add beef broth and lemon juice and bring to a boil. Stir in carrots, cabbage and dates. Cover with tagine lid, reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Stir in orange sections. Replace lid and simmer for 10 minutes or until heated through. Lamb should cut easily with a fork and if not quite tender, replace cover and simmer until tender.
