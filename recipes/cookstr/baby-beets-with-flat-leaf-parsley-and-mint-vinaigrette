Make the Vinaigrette: In a bowl, whisk together all the ingredients except the salt, pepper, and mint. Taste and season with salt and pepper. If using within 3 or 4 hours, stir in the mint and refrigerate. Otherwise, cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Stir the mint into the vinaigrette an hour or so before serving. (Makes about 1 1/2 cups) For the Salad: Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Spread the 3 cups of salt over the bottom of a shallow roasting pan or sheet pan. In a large bowl, combine the beets, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Wrap the beets completely in large sheets of aluminum foil and transfer to the pan. The foil packets will sit directly on the salt. Roast for about 45 minutes, or until the beets are tender. Let the beets cool in the foil; this will make them easier to peel. Peel each beet and cut in half, quarters, or slices. Transfer to a bowl. In another bowl, toss the parsley with about a tablespoon of olive oil and the lemon juice. Toss and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the vinaigrette to the beets and toss until they are coated. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the beets among 4 serving plates, mounding them in the center of the plates. Arrange the parsley salad around and on top of the beets. Garnish each serving with cheese and cracked pepper and serve.
