Preheat an oven to 350Â°F. Using the 1 teaspoon butter, grease an 8-inch round cake pan that has a swivel arm for easy cake removal, or heavily butter and flour parchment paper for pan lining. In a small bowl, combine the flour and salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the remaining butter until it is creamy, about 1 minute, Gradually blend in the sugar, then add the eggs, beating until smooth and fluffy, about 1 minute. In a small bowl, combine the cocoa and oil, stirring until well blended and smooth. Add the cocoa mixture and the vanilla to the butter mixture and beat just to blend. Add the flour mixture in two or three increments, beating well each time. Spread the mixture evenly into the greased pan. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Remove the cake from the pan and put it on a cake plate. Decorate if desired, Cut into wedges and serve warm.
