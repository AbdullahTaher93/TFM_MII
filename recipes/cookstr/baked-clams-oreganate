If you donâ€™t know how to open clams yourself, ask a fishmonger to open them for you, leaving them on the half shell. Refrigerate until ready to use. Place broiler tray on the lowest rack and preheat broiler. Combine bread crumbs, parsley, garlic, oregano, and salt and pepper. Add olive oil and toss mixture until crumbs are evenly coated. Add the broth and continue to mix until very well blended. The mixture should be quite wet. Put approximately 1 heaping teaspoon of bread crumb mixture on each clam. Smooth over the top, making sure that the edges are sealed. Using the edge of a teaspoon, cut ridges into the topping. Pour 1/8 inch cold water into cookie sheet with sides (to keep the clams moist while broiling) and broil for about 7 minutes or until the bread crumb topping is well browned and crisp. Put 6 clams on each of 6 small, warm serving plates. Garnish each plate with a lemon wedge and parsley sprig and serve.
