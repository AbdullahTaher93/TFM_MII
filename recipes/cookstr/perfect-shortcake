Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a mixing bowl or food processor, combine the flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add butter and mix with a fork or process, pulsing the motor on and off, until the mixture resembles crumbs. Add the milk all at once and stir or process briefly to form a soli: dough. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead very lightly. Do not overwork the dough or shortcakes will be rough. Roll the dough into a 6-inch square, trim the edges, then cut it into three long rectangles. Cur each rectangle in half to form 6 neat cakes, each about 2 by 3 inches. Arrange the cakes a few inches apart on a baking sheet and bake on the top rack of the preheated oven for 12 minutes, or until the tops are browned.
