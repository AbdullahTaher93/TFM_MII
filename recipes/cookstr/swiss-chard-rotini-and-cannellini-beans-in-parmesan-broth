Place olive oil in a large pot and heat over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, shallots, and chili flakes, and stir until the shallots are translucent and the garlic takes on a bit of color. Add the stock, thyme, and Parmesan rinds. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the soup and simmer for 30 minutes, being sure to scrape the bits of cheese from the bottom of the pot every few minutes with a wooden spoon. Feel free to eat the melty bits that stick to the spoon. Turn heat to medium and bring back to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Remove the remaining Parmesan rinds and discard (or nibble them, suck on them, give them to the dog). Add the Swiss chard and beans. Cover and allow to simmer for 10 more minutes. Stir the lemon zest into the soup and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve in bowls and garnish each with a fresh spritz of lemon juice and a fine dusting of the grated Parmesan.
