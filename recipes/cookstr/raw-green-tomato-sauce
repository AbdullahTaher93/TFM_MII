Put the tomate into a pan, barely cover with water, and bring to a simmer. Continue to cook until the tomates turn a lighter, faded green and are just soft but not falling apart-about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Put Â½ cup (125 ml) of the cooking water into a blender jar, add the cilantro, garlic, chiles, and salt, and blend until almost smooth. Drain the tomatoes and add them to the blender jar; blend for a few seconds just to break them up roughly. The sauce should have a rough texture. Serve sprinkled with the onion and cilantro.
