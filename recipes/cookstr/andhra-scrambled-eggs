Beat the eggs lightly in a bowl, and whisk or stir in the salt. Heat a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil, and when it is hot, add the shallots, garlic, ginger, chiles, and turmeric and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, until they are softened. Add the eggs and swirl and tilt the skillet to distribute them. Using a flat wooden spoon or spatula, toss the eggs with the shallots and tomatoes, cooking the eggs while getting everything well mixed. Then continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the eggs are well cooked. Turn out onto a flat plate to serve, garnished with the fresh coriander. Serve with a green salad and Chapatis.
