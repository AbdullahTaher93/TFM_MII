Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, add the onion and garlic, and sauté for 5 minutes, until soft. Add the pine nuts and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 more minutes. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring, for 6 to 7 minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken. Add the saffron and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Season the monkfish with salt and pepper to taste and sauté for 1 minute on each side. Pour the sauce into the skillet, reduce the heat, and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes, until the fish is flaky. Remove from the heat and serve.
