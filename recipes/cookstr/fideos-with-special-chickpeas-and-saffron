If using dried chickpeas, put them in a soup pot and cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to a simmer and season with salt. Gently simmer the chickpeas until tender, adding more water as necessary to keep them covered with liquid, 1 to 2 hours depending on the age of the chickpeas. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the canola oil in a soup pot over medium heat and sauté the onion, carrot, and a generous pinch of salt until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Add the bay leaf, vanilla bean, saffron, coriander seed, fennel seed, cocoa, chile, tomatoes, and water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Cook to reduce by one-third, about 30 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and bay leaf, discarding the bay leaf and reserving the vanilla bean. In a blender, puree the broth and vegetables. Strain the puree through a fine-mesh sieve. Scrape the vanilla seeds from the bean (if they have not already fallen into the simmering broth) and add. You should have about 5 cups. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the pasta in an even layer on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Break the pasta into 2-inch pieces. Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the chard and cook until wilted. Add the vegetable broth and bring to a simmer. Add the chickpeas and toasted pasta. Simmer until the broth has been absorbed and the noodles are tender. Just before serving, stir in ¾ cup of the aioli and season with salt, if necessary.
