Preheat the oven to 300°. Cut both types of peppers lengthwise and remove the seeds and veins. Lightly coat a heavy skillet with olive oil. Sauté the peppers until they give off their juices and wilt. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place the trout on a baking sheet and heat in the oven for 10 minutes. Serve with the peppers, fresh lemon wedges, and freshly grated horseradish.
