Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until browned. Stir in the curry paste. Add the coconut milk and soy sauce, and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce the heat, and stir in the mushrooms, and most of the scallions. Simmer for about 8 minutes, or until the chicken is tender, and the juices run clear when pierced with the point of a knife. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, garnished with the cilantro and remaining scallions.
