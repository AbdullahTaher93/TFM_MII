Place the radish, scallions, onion, and ginger in a large bowl and toss to mix them well. Stuff half the mixture into a sterilized 4-quart jar and add 1 tablespoon of the salt and the garlic and/or Sichuan pepper if you wish. Add the remaining radish mixture and the second tablespoon of salt, and pour on the vinegar, which should cover the mixture completely. Seal and shake the jar to distribute the vinegar well. Place in a sunny spot by a window for 2 to 4 days (see headnote), giving the jar a shake occasionally to help blend the flavors. It is now ready to use. The pickle will keep indefinitely if well sealed and refrigerated. To serve, use a clean spoon or fork or chopsticks to lift out a clump of radish strands and place them in a condiment bowl.
