In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast cumin seeds, stirring, until fragrant and they just begin to brown, about 3 minutes. Immediately transfer to a mortar or a spice grinder and grind. Set aside. In the same skillet, heat oil over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add onions and celery and cook, stirring, until celery is softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, peppercorns and reserved cumin and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Transfer to slow cooker stoneware. Add chicken stock and stir well. Add barley, turkey and corn. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or on High for 4 hours, until turkey and barley are tender. Stir in chili powder solution. Add green pepper and jalape√±o pepper, if using, and stir well. Cover and cook on High for 20 minutes, until pepper is tender. To serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with cilantro, if using.
