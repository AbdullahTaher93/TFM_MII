TO MAKE THE BLINI In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, crème fraîche, salt, eggs, and 2 tablespoons of the melted butter. Place a heavy skillet preferable a well seasoned iron one, on medium high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Drop about a tablespoon or so of batter into the skillet for each blini, they should be the size of silver dollars. Cook as you would pancakes, until they brown on one side, then turn to cook the other side. Save the extra batter for pancakes if you like. Transfer the blini to a small plate and keep warm, on top of the stove, or serve at room temperature. To serve, place a dab of crème fraîche on each blini and top it with a little caviar. Sprinkle the chives on top.
