Drizzle the chops with a little olive oil and black pepper leave to sit in the fridge until you need to cook them-all day is fine. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to heat up. To prepare the caramelized apples heat the butter in a frying pan. Add the apples and the sugar and toss on the heat for 4-5 minutes until cooked and golden. Squeeze in the lemon juice and keep warm. Heat a frying pan until very hot, then cook the chops in batches, on both sides until golden. Sprinkle with salt, then pop them onto the hot baking sheet in the oven and cook for another 5-10 minutes until cooked through. Serve the pork chops with the caramelized apples and some Garlic and Mustard Potatoes on the side.
