Preheat oven to 350 degrees Prepare a 10½-by-15½-inch jelly-roll pan. Beat the butter and sugar until light and creamy. Beat in the egg yolks, citron, orange peel and spices. Add the flour and salt and stir until the dough holds together. Pat the dough into the prepared jelly-roll pan and bake for 20 minutes. While the dough is baking, prepare the topping. Combine the butter, milk, honey and sugar in a 1½-quart saucepan. Stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid is bubbling. Stir in the almonds and simmer for 5 minutes. Keep warm. Remove the dough from the oven and spread it with the almond-honey glaze and bake for an additional 20 minutes. Let the dough cool for 10 minutes before scoring it into 1-by-2½-inch bars. Store, unrefrigerated, in airtight containers.
