Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly butter a 3-quart (8-inch) charlotte mold. Stir the chocolate and butter in a medium bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Set aside; keep warm. Stir the sugar and water in a heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil. Remove the sugar syrup from the heat. Set aside; keep hot. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl just to blend. Sift the flour over the eggs and whisk to form a smooth, thick batter. Gradually add the hot sugar syrup, whisking to ensure that no lumps remain. Whisk in the warm melted chocolate mixture to form a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the prepared charlotte mold. Place the mold in a heavy roasting pan. Add enough hot water to the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the mold. Carefully transfer the pan to the oven. Bake until the outer 1-inch perimeter of the cake is set and the center 3 inches are still slightly loose (do not overbake; the cake will become firm once it has been chilled), about 1 hour. Remove the mold from the roasting pan. Transfer the cake in the mold to the refrigerator. Chill until the cake is cool, at least 2 hours. Cover and keep refrigerated until cold. Bring a medium saute pan of water to a simmer. Remove from the heat. Place the mold in the hot water for about 1 minute (this will help release the cake from the mold). Run a small sharp knife around the edges of the cake. Invert the mold onto a platter, shaking gently to release the cake from the mold. (If the cake does not release easily from the mold, return the mold to the hot water for 1 minute more.) Remove the mold. Cover the cake and refrigerate. Heat the blade of a large sharp knife over a medium flame just until warm. Slice the cake with the warm blade into 8 wedges, rewarming the blade slightly in between slices. Transfer the wedges to plates. Spoon the vanilla sauce around the cake and serve cold.
