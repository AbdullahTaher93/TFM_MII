In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and eggs until light and lemon-colored. Add this to the sweet potatoes, and stir just until blended. Then gradually whisk in the evaporated and regular milks, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, vanilla extract, and lemon zest. Pour into the prepared casserole. Bake, stirring well two or three times, until sweet potatoes are tender and the top is lightly browned, about 1 hour. let stand 5 min before serving.
