Filling: In a saucepan, heat 2 tbsp (25 mL) milk, espresso powder and butter until butter melts. Set aside. In a mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment, beat Neufchâtel cheese, cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed until very smooth, for 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Reduce to low speed and mix in milk, hazelnuts, liqueur and espresso mixture. Pour over frozen crust, smoothing out to sides of pan.

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours before decorating or serving. Decoration: Place a slice on a plate. Pour 2 tbsp (25 mL) Coffee-Flavored Syrup on top and sprinkle with hazelnuts.
