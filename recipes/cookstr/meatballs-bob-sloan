For the Meatballs: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 12 × 16-inch casserole with vegetable oil. Put the bread in a medium bowl, pour in the milk, and let sit for 1 minute. In a large bowl, combine the meats, the bread mixture, ½ cup of the tomato sauce, the eggs, cheese, oregano, and basil, using your hands if necessary. Shape the meat mixture into 1½-inch balls by rolling them between your palms. Arrange the balls on a large platter or baking sheet. S. Measure 1½ tablespoons of the oil into a large frying pan and place over medium-high heat for about 1 minute. Add half the meatballs and cook until brown on all sides, turning as needed, about 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked meatballs to the prepared casserole and repeat with the remaining oil and meatballs. When all the meatballs are browned, pour the remaining 3 cups tomato sauce into the casserole and stir briefly so that all the meatballs are coated. Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes until the meatballs are firm and cooked through. Remove the foil and bake for 15 minutes more.
