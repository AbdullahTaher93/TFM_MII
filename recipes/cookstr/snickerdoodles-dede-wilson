Whisk flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl. In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar gradually, beating until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Add about one-third of flour mixture and mix on low speed. Gradually add remaining flour, mixing just until blended. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to roll into balls, at least 2 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. To make topping, combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Roll dough into 1-inch balls between your palms, then roll in cinnamon sugar to coat. Place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets; gently flatten just enough so they donâ€™t roll off. Bake just until light golden brown around edges, about 12 minutes. Slide parchment onto racks to cool cookies completely. Lifespan: 2 weeks at room temperature in airtight container.
