Combine the flour, eggs, salt, nutmeg, and 1¼ cups cold water in a large bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon and reserve. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Pick up small amounts of dough with a teaspoon and push the dough into the water with another, or just push the dough through a colander. Dip the spoons in the boiling water to avoid their becoming sticky and unmanageable.Using a wooden spoon, stir the spaetzle off the bottom of the pot and cook for 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the spaetzle to a bowl of ice water. Repeat the process until all of the dough has been used. Rinse and drain well. Refrigerate until ready to serve. In a large skillet, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the spaetzle and lightly sauté until warmed through. Season with salt and pepper and serve warm.
