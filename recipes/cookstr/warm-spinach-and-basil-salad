Toss the spinach and basil together in a large salad bowl. Heat the oil in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and pine nuts and saut√© until the nuts begin to brown slightly. Stir in the prosciutto and cook 1 minute more. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss the spinach and basil with the warm dressing and sprinkle the salad with the Parmesan. Serve immediately and pass the peppermill.
