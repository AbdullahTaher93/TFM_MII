Prep: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Using your chef’s knife, cut the dried apricots into small pieces, about ½ inch thick. Place the coconut and apricot pieces in a mixing bowl. Set aside. Combine the water, granulated sugar, and corn syrup in a saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Pour the boiling water-sugar mixture into the bowl containing the coconut and apricot. Add the vanilla, stirring thoroughly. Stir the egg whites into the mixture until combined. The mixture will have a thick consistency. Using the cookie scoop, place small mounds of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart. Bake at 350°F for 15 minutes, or until the tops and bottoms of the macaroons are lightly browned. You can easily alter this recipe, customizing it to your own tastes. You can spice up the traditional recipe by adding dried apricots, chocolate chips, dried cherries, or toffee pieces, for example. You might also consider dipping the macaroons in chocolate for a particularly luxurious treat.
