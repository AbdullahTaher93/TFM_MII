Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375°F. Roll out the puff pastry to 1/8 inch thick and prick it all over with a fork. Cut out six rounds a little larger than a 6-ounce ramekin diameter. In a small bowl, combine the sugars. Sprinkle them evenly over the puff pastry rounds, then transfer the rounds to a baking sheet. Bake the rounds on the center rack until golden brown, about 20 minutes. If the sugar is not completely glossy, put the pastry under the broiler for a few seconds. Grease six 8-ounce ramekins with ½ tablespoon butter each. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the maple syrup to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer vigorously until the mixture reduces to a thick, molasses-type consistency, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove from the heat and divide the syrup mixture among the greased ramekins. Arrange the apple pieces in the ramekins, packing them in tightly. Place the ramekins in a baking pan and pour hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover with aluminum foil and bake on the center rack until the apples are easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 15 minutes to add color. Remove the baking pan from the oven, and then transfer the ramekins to a dish towel spread out on the countertop. Place the baked puff pastry rounds on top of the apples-you will have to crush them a little to make sure they lie flat-and carefully invert each hot ramekin onto a plate to serve. Serve warm. To give the tatin that shiny brûlée surface, sprinkle the apples on the top of the inverted tart with sugar and brown with a blowtorch.
