Purée the raspberries in a blender and press through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, discarding the seeds. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the purée and the jelly and bring to a boil. Stir in the sugar, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 minute. Slowly add the cornstarch mixture to the raspberry mixture and cook, stirring, until thickened. Stir in the framboise and transfer to a fondue pot. Keep warm over low heat. Arrange the cake and cookie dippers on a serving platter and set it next to the fondue pot. Spear the morsels on fondue forks and swirl them in the warm sauce.
