Spread pine nuts evenly on baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown. Watch carefully; they burn very quickly. Reserve a handful for topping. In a food processor, purée hot nuts, eggs, honey, sugar and salt until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, bring milk to a simmer. Gradually whisk into the egg mixture. Return entire mixture to the saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Be careful not to let it boil. Transfer to a clean large bowl. Let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until completely cold or overnight. Stir cream mixture. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer’s instructions. When serving, top with reserved pine nuts.
