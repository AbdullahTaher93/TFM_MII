To make the dressing: Whisk together the orange juice, lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Prepare the apple and vegetables and place them in the bowl as you go: Peel the apple or donâ€™t, and shred it on the large-holed side of a hand grater. To prevent the apples from discoloring, toss well with the dressing. Thinly slice the cabbage and then cut across the slices about every inch. Peel the carrots and shred on the large-holed side of a hand grater. Mince the celery. Mince the scallions. To shred the kale: Rinse the kale leaves and shake off excess water. Strip the leaves from the large stems and pile on a chopping board. Gather the kale into a compact mass and thinly slice it. Then cut down across the slices, chopping the kale into 1-to 2-inch pieces. Go after those larger pieces of kale that got away from you when you were slicing it. Add the shredded kale to the bowl and toss well. Delicious served right away, but the sweetness intensifies as it sits. This slaw will keep in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days. .
