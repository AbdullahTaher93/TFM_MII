Stir all the ingredients for the base together until smooth. I use the paddle attachment to my mixer which my children love operating, but a bowl and a wooden spoon will do the job just as well. You will find, either way, that some of the dark brown sugar stays in rubbly, though very small, lumps, but don’t worry about that. Press the sandy mixture into the brownie pan and make the surface as even as possible. To make the topping, melt the chocolates and butter together (in a microwave for ease, for a minute or two on medium) and spread on the base. Put the pan in the refrigerator to set. When the chocolate has hardened, cut into small squares—because, more-ish as it undeniably is, it is also very rich.
