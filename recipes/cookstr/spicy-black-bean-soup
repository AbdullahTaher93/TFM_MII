Put the beans in a large pot and cover with plenty of cold water. Bring to a boil, then let boil for 2 minutes, Turn off the heat, cover, and let sit for 1 hour. Drain the beans and put them back in the pot with 4 quarts fresh cold water. Bring to a boil, then continue to cook at a low boil, partially covered, until tender, about 1 hour; do not undercook. Remove from the heat but donâ€™t drain. Mix the spices, cocoa, and flour together in a small bowl and set aside. Heat about half of the oil in a very large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onions and bell pepper and cook, stirring, about 8 minutes. Add the remaining oil to the skillet, then stir in the garlic and spice mixture. Lower the heat slightly and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat. Ladle a cup or so of the bean water into the skillet, then scrape the contents of the skillet back into the beans. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato juice, salt, chiles, tomato paste, oregano, basil, bay leaf, and brown sugar. Bring the soup to a simmer, then simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Taste, adding more salt if needed. Add the orange juice and vinegar and simmer 10 minutes more. The soup should be soupy but thick. Serve hot; garnished with the fresh parsley.
