Cut the broccoli into florets. Pare the stems and cut them crosswise into thin slices. Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add the sesame seeds and cook, stirring almost constantly, about 1â€“2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add the oil, soy sauce, and hot pepper to the pan and stir combine. Add the broccoli and stir-fry for about 2 minutes. Pour in the stock and cover. Cook for about 2 minutes longer, or until crisp-tender. Stir in the sesame seeds and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
