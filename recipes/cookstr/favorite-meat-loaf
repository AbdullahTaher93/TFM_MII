Thoroughly blend the meats, garlic, onion, seasonings, and crumbs. Add the eggs and blend again. Arrange the bacon or salt pork slices on the bottom of a shallow baking pan or dish 1 to 1½ inches deep. Form the meat into a loaf of rather even proportions and lay it upon the strips. Lay a few additional strips of bacon or pork across the top of the loaf. Bake at 350 degrees 1 to 1½ hours. Test with a meat thermometer, and when its center has reached 150 degrees it is done. Baste several times during the baking. Serve hot with a tomato sauce and scalloped potatoes, or cold with mustard or Cumberland sauce and a salad.
