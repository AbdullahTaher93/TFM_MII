Mix the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add the water and olive oil. Stir to make a soft dough, adding more water as needed. Knead for 8-10 minutes on a lightly floured work surface until smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball. Transfer to an oiled bowl, turn to coat with oil, and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place about 1½ hours, until doubled. Roll the dough out to a rectangle of about 10 × 16in (25 × 40cm). Brush 1½ tbsp of the extra virgin olive oil over half of the dough. Brush water around the edges of the other half and fold the dough in half, to make a rectangle of about 10 × 8in (25 × 20cm). Transfer to a large baking sheet. Press the dough with your knuckles to dimple the surface. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let stand for about 30–40 minutes, until puffy. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Drizzle the remaining 1½ tbsp olive oil over the dough, letting it pool in the dimpled dough. Sprinkle with the sea salt. Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until risen and golden. Slide the focaccia onto a wire rack and let cool. Serve the bread the day it is baked, either warm or cooled, cut into chunks. 4. Slide the focaccia onto a wire rack and let cool.
