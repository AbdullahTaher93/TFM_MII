Season the steaks on both sides with pepper and a very small pinch of salt. Heat half the oil in a heavy frying pan, add the steaks and fry over a high heat for about 2 minutes, until brown. Turn the steaks, lower the heat to medium, and continue cooking for 2-5 minutes, depending on their thickness and how well you like them done. To test the cooking of a steak, press the meat in the center with your finger (don't worry, it won't burn you). If soft, the steak is rare, if slightly resistant, the meat will be medium, and if firm it is well done (and likely to be dry). Remove the steaks to a dish, cover with foil and keep warm. Heat the remaining oil in the pan, add the shallots and the garlic and fry, stirring for 1-2 minutes until they begin to brown. Pour in the wine and simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring and scraping to dissolve the pan juices, until the wine is reduced almost to a glaze. Stir in the parsley, chives, tarragon or basil and any juices that have run from the meat. Take the pan off the heat. Whisk in the butter a few pieces at a time so that it softens and thickens the sauce without melting to oil. Taste and adjust the seasoning, spoon the sauce over the steaks and serve at once.
