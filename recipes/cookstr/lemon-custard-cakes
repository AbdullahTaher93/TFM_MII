Preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat eight 6-ounce custard cups with nonstick cooking spray, and set aside. Place ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons of the sugar and all of the flour and salt in a medium-size bowl and whisk to mix. Set aside. Combine the milk, egg yolks (reserve the whites), and lemon juice in a large bowl and whisk until blended. Add the flour mixture to the milk mixture and whisk until blended. Set aside. Place the reserved egg whites in a large bowl. Using clean beaters, beat until soft peaks form when the beaters are raised. Gradually beat in the remaining ¼ cup sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Gently whisk a third of the egg whites into the batter. Whisk in half of the remaining whites; then whisk in the rest. Divide the custard among the prepared cups and arrange them in a large roasting pan. Fill the pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the cups. Bake uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the custards are slightly puffed and browned on top. The tops should not be sticky when lightly touched. Transfer the custard cups to wire racks and allow to cool for 1 hour. Chill uncovered for at least 3 hours or until firm. Then cover and keep chilled until ready to serve. To serve, run a small sharp knife around each custard and invert it onto a serving plate. For Smooth/Puréed Diets: Remove the browned top layer from the custard before inverting it onto a plate. For a Change: • Drizzle a tablespoon or two of berry purée over the dessert plate before inverting the custard onto the plate.
