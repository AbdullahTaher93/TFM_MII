Cut the stems from the beet bulbs, leaving ¾-inch attached. Do not trim the roots. Wash well to remove all traces of soil, and boil in salted water for 1 hour, or until tender. Leave until cool enough to handle. In a bowl, beat the olive oil with the red wine vinegar, cumin, and some freshly ground black pepper to make a dressing. Wearing rubber gloves so the beet juice doesn’t stain your hands, peel the warm beet bulbs and trim the roots. Halve them and cut into slender wedges and place in the dressing. Halve the onion, slice into slender wedges, and add to the beets. Add the parsley and toss well. Serve this salad warm or at room temperature.
