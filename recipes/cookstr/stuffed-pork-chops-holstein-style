Have the butcher cut a pocket in each of the chops. Preheat oven to 350°F. Sprinkle outside of chops with salt. To make stuffing, peel apples, remove core and cut in ½"-thick lengthwise or crosswise slices. Heat butter in a skillet and when hot and bubbling, add apple slices. Sauté and stir over low heat until apples begin to turn golden brown and soft. They should not become completely soft or lose their shape. This should take about 6 or 7 minutes. Sauté only one layer of apple slices at a time. When all the apples are sautéed, chop them coarsely or dice. Add raisins and rum in which they soaked. Add breadcrumbs or small croutons and toss together lightly but thoroughly with a fork. Taste the stuffing and flavor with cinnamon and sugar. You can also add a little more rum if you like. The stuffing should be only slightly moist. Stuff chops with apple mixture and close with toothpicks or sew with kitchen thread. Arrange chops in a baking pan with a cover. Add just enough water to cover bottom of pan. Bake covered 30 minutes. Add more water to pan if it is needed during baking. Remove cover and bake another 30 minutes, or until chops are nicely browned and tender when pierced with a sharp-pronged fork or skewer.
