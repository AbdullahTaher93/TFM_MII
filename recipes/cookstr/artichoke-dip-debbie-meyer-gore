Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Chop the artichokes and mix with remaining ingredients. Bake in quiche dish or an ovenproof dish until thoroughly heated and bubbly, about 30 to 45 minutes. I prefer to mix this together and let it sit overnight. Bake before serving. Serve with water crackers. Variations: Lynne Borkowski, a friend from working together at Caviar to Cabernet, cooks, drains and crumbles 16-ounces of bacon and sprinkles this on top before baking. It makes a hearty appetizer and the bacon adds great flavor. For a Southwest flair, I have also made the basic recipe and added a 7-ounce can of chopped green chiles. Cooked, chopped shrimp (about 1 cup) added to the basic recipe adds a seafood twist!
