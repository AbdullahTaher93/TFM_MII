Cook the farro in the 1½ cups boiling water in a small saucepan for about 40 minutes, until very tender. Drain well. In a stand mixer or large bowl, mix the flour, yeast, and salt. Heat the 1¼ cups water to the temperature the yeast package recommends for mixing into a dry mixture, usually 110°F to 130°F. With the mixer running, pour in the water and 3 tablespoons of the oil. Knead until well mixed, then knead for 5 minutes more. It will be a sticky, soft dough. Knead in the cooked farro. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan with a little olive oil. Scrape the dough into the prepared pan and spread it out to the corners. Let the focaccia rise, covered, for an hour, or until doubled in height. Preheat the oven to 375°F. When the focaccia has risen, sprinkle the thyme, rosemary, and onion over the dough. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil, and top with the Parmesan or salt. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the focaccia is firm and browned around the edges.
