Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer. Whisk the yolks, sugar, and Marsala with half the orange zest in a large heatproof bowl. Place over (but not in) the simmering water. Using a balloon whisk, whisk constantly for 5â€“10 minutes, or until the zabaglione is pale, thick, fluffy, and warm. Immediately divide the zabaglione among 4 glasses. Garnish with the remaining orange zest; serve immediately with ladyfingers or biscotti.
