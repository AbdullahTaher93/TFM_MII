To make the “noodles,” use a spiralizer or vegetable peeler to form the zucchini into long, thin strips. Place the noodles in a colander and let sit for 20 minutes to drain their natural liquid. (This will keep the dish from becoming too watery.) Place the almond butter, lime juice, Nama Shoyu, honey, and ginger in a blender or food processor and mix until combined. If the sauce is too thick, add water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time until the desired consistency is reached. In a large bowl, gently mix the noodles with the almond sauce. Transfer the noodles to plates and top with the bean sprouts and almonds. Serve immediately.
