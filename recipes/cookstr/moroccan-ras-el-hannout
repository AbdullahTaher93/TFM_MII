In a small skillet over medium-low heat, toast the cumin seeds for 2 minutes, until fragrant. Place the seeds in a spice grinder and cool completely. Add the saffron to the spice grinder and grind with the cumin seeds. Remove the saffron and cumin mixture to a small mixing bowl and combine with the remaining spices.
