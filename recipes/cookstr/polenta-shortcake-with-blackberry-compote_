In a medium bowl, combine ½ cup of the blackberries, the sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and salt and mash them together with your hands or your grandmother’s potato masher, until you have a gooey mess. Let the blackberries sit for 30 minutes. (Go make the shortcakes.) Press the berry mess through a chinois or fine-mesh strainer to get rid of the seeds. Add the remaining 1½ cups blackberries, stir, and serve. Preheat the oven to 325°F. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, polenta, salt, baking powder, and granulated sugar. Make a well in the center and pour the cream inside it carefully. Slowly and gently drag the outsides of the well in together until the dough is just combined. With your hand, divide the dough into 12 irregular blobs and place them on an unlined baking sheet. Brush each lightly with cream, sprinkle with Maldon salt and turbinado sugar, and bake until just set and lightly golden in color, 10 to 15 minutes. To serve: Split each shortcake in half, stuff with blackberry compote, and douse it with corn cream. Serve to eight-year-olds absolutely immediately.
