Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Toss the eggplant, zucchini, onions, and red peppers in a roasting pan. Drizzle with the oil and toss. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and thyme. Continue roasting for 30–35 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Reduce the temperature to 350°F (180°C). Stir the tomatoes with their juices, the lentils, and the parsley into the roasted vegetables and season with salt and pepper as needed. Transfer the vegetables to a 9in (23cm) square baking dish. Beat the yogurt, eggs, and paprika together and season lightly with salt and pepper (keeping in mind that the feta cheese is very salty). Spread over the vegetables and sprinkle with the feta. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and bake for 10 minutes more, or until the top is golden brown. Let stand 5 minutes, then serve hot (or cool and serve at room temperature).
