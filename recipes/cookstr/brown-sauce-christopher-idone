Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Wash the bones under cold running water and drain. In a roasting pan large enough to hold them, brown the bones in the oven, turning them every 30 minutes, for a total of 2 1/2 hours. Scatter the vegetables over the bones for the last 20 minutes of roasting. The bones should be deep brown in color. Transfer the bones and vegetables from the roasting pan to a stockpot. Pour 1 quart of water into the roasting pan and deglaze, scraping the brown bits that stick to the bottom of the pan. Pour the liquid into the stockpot. Add the remaining ingredients and enough water to cover by several inches. Bring the stock to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, occasionally skimming the foam from the surface, for 8 to 10 hours. Line a strainer with a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth or a clean cotton towel. Place the strainer into a clean pot and ladle the stock into the strainer. Discard the solids and allow the stock to cool completely. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze indefinitely in small containers.
