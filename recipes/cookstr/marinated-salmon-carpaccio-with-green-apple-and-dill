Layout the salmon on an immaculately clean work surface. With a very sharp, thin-bladed knife, ideally a boning or salmon knife, horizontally slice the salmon as thinly as possible, working on a slight bias from top to bottom. You should have about 12 slices (3 per portion). Lay about 3 salmon slices on each of 4 chilled or cold salad plates, pressing them together to form a single layer covering the surface of the plate. Squeeze the lime and orange pulp into a small bowl, extracting as much juice as possible. Add the mustard, fennel seeds, shallot, and olive oil and whisk to combine. Add the lime and orange segments. Spoon a scant layer of this marinade evenly over each portion of salmon and marinate in the refrigerator for 10 minutes while you prepare the apple. Peel the apple and use a vegetable peeler to cut it into a fine julienne. Put it in a small bowl and add the lime and orange zests and dill. Toss and set aside. Mound some dressed apple in the center of each carpaccio and serve at once.
