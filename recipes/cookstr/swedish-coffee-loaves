Soften the yeast in the lukewarm water. Mix together the butter, sugar, cardamom, salt and hot milk. Cool until lukewarm. Add the egg, softened yeast and 2½ cups of the flour. Beat thoroughly. Add enough of the remaining flour, a little at a time, to make a soft dough. Set a little aside for kneading. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly buttered bowl, turning once to grease the surface. Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 1½ hours, until doubled in bulk. When light, punch down, turn out on a lightly floured surface and knead lightly. Mix the raisins with the dough and divide the mixture into 2 parts. Cut each half into 3 pieces of equal size. Roll the pieces into long ropes and braid 3 ropes together for each loaf. Place the loaves on a buttered cookie sheet. Cover with a towel and let rise again in a warm place for about 45 minutes, until doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Brush the loaves with beaten egg; sprinkle with sugar and chopped nuts if desired. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
