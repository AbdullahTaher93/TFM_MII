Combine the carrots, onions, celery, and leeks in a large saucepan with 7 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to low. Add the peppercorns, parsley, bay leaves, and salt. Partially cover the saucepan and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the stock is well-flavored. Strain the stock into a large bowl. Use immediately, or cool completely to refrigerate or freeze.
