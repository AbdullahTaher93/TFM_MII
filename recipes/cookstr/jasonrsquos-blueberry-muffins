Butter the muffin tin with the 2 tablespoons butter, set aside. Preheat the oven to 400°. In a small bowl, toss ¼ cup of the flour with the blueberries and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining 1 ¾ cups flour, the baking powder, salt, and sugar. Blend in the melted butter, eggs, and buttermilk. Mix until the flour is dampened. Add the grated lemon peel and the vanilla extract. Fold in the blueberries and fill the muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake for 20 minutes. Allow the muffins to set for 2 to 3 minutes before removing from the pan.
