Core the tomatoes and cut them in half. Gently squeeze out most of the seeds, and cut the tomatoes into ¼-inch (no larger) dice. Toss the diced tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and jalapeño together in a mixing bowl. Add the salt and lime juice, then stir in the oil, if using. Let sit for a few minutes. The salsa can be made and kept at room temperature for up to 4 hours—no longer—before serving. Stir and taste again before serving.
