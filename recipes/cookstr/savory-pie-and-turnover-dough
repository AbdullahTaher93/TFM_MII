Mix the flour in a large bowl with the salt, then incorporate the water, vinegar, and egg yolks and work with your hands until the dough forms a smooth ball. Let sit for 30 minutes covered with plastic wrap. Roll the dough into a 10 × 15–inch rectangle. With a rubber spatula spread 1/3 cup of the lard over the dough. With the aid of a knife, fold one side over the top, then fold over the other side, business-letter fashion. Wrap again in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Repeat, using another 1/3 cup of the lard, refrigerate 15 minutes more, and repeat a third time, leaving the dough refrigerated this time for 1 hour. The dough is better still if refrigerated overnight. [May be frozen]
