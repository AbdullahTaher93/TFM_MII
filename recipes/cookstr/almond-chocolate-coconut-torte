Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Cake: In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate and butter. Microwave, uncovered, on Medium (50%) for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, or until chocolate and butter are soft and almost melted. Stir until melted and smooth. Stir in brown sugar until smooth. Let cool slightly. Add eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in vanilla and almond extract. In a small bowl, mix together almond meal, flour, coconut and salt. Add to chocolate mixture, stirring until smooth. Spread batter in prepared pan, smoothing top. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Top of cake will be puffed (do not overbake). Let cool completely in pan on a rack. Chocolate Glaze: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate and cream. Microwave, uncovered, on Medium (50%) for 1 minute, stirring every 30 seconds, or until cream is hot and chocolate is starting to melt. Stir well until chocolate is melted and mixture is thick and smooth. If chocolate is not completely melted, return to microwave for another 10 to 20 seconds or until chocolate is soft and melted. Stir well. If glaze is very thin, let stand for a few minutes to thicken slightly. Invert cake onto a platter and remove parchment paper. Pour glaze over top and evenly spread with a spatula, letting glaze drip down the sides. Refrigerate until glaze is firm. Cut into wedges and serve. Variation: Top batter with ½ cup (125 mL) chopped chocolate or chocolate chips before baking.
