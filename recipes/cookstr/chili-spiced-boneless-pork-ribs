Position the oven racks so that the top rack is about 8 inches from the top of the oven. Preheat the oven to convection roast at 400Â°F. Assemble the broiler pan and rack that comes with your oven and lightly grease the rack. Or, cover a shallow baking pan or broiler pan with foil and coat with nonstick spray. Sprinkle the ribs with the chili powder and salt, then dust lightly with the flour. Arrange the rib pieces 2 inches apart on the prepared pan and convection roast on the top rack for 20 minutes. To make the sauce, combine all the ingredients with 1 cup water in a medium saucepan, mix well, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Brush the sauce on the ribs and roast for 10 to 15 more minutes. Remove from the oven and serve with additional sauce.
