Warm the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and sausage. Cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and wine and cook for 1 minute longer. Add the tomatoes, basil, marjoram or oregano, paprika, and pepper. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the clam juice, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and add the mussels. Cover and simmer for 8 minutes, or until the mussels open. Discard any unopened mussels. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve with the cheese.
