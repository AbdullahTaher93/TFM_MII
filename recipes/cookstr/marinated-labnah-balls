Mix the yogurt with the salt, place in a cheesecloth in a strainer over a bowl and leave to drain the whey for about 8 hours or overnight. (If in a hurry, 4 hours is just sufficient.) This thick yogurt cheese is then ready to be used in cooking savory and sweet dishes. To make the labnah balls, ensure the yogurt is properly drained and of a dense texture for best results. Roll the yogurt into 1Â¼-inch balls, then roll in the cumin seeds, paprika, and thyme. Place in a bowl or sterilized jelly jar, and add the red chile, garlic, and sprigs of herbs, and cover with olive oil to marinate. They keep for a couple of weeks in the fridge and are perfect to eat when your cupboard looks bare: serve them on toast, smeared on broiled meats, or in sandwiches as a healthy alternative to mayonnaise or cream cheese.
