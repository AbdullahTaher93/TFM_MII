Whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and Dijon mustard. Set aside. Cut tofu into ¼-inch-thick slices. Place in a shallow dish in a single layer. Pour the soy sauce mixture over the tofu. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate overnight. Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove the tofu from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Place tofu on a baking sheet and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake until the tofu is browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. Cut the ciabatta into 6 pieces; cut each piece in half horizontally. Whisk the marinade again to emulsify it. Brush some of the marinade on the cut sides of the bread. Divide the cucumber slices among the bread bottoms. Layer with tofu and arugula. Add bread tops.
