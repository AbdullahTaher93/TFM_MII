Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and when hot, add the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, very fragrant, and golden at the edges. Don’t let the onion turn brown, however, or it will be too sweet. Sprinkle the onion with a little salt and black pepper and scrape into a small bowl. Stir the minced chives into the onion. Place the skillet back on the stove. Stack the slices of smoked salmon and roll them up lengthwise. Slice the roll into ½-inch slices, then unravel the slices and briefly sauté the salmon over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, just until it loses its translucency, about 30 seconds. Add the salmon to the bowl of hot onion. Place the same skillet back on the stove and melt the butter over medium-high heat. When hot and bubbling, add the beaten eggs and turn the heat to medium. Let the eggs cook, undisturbed, just until they start to set on the bottom, about 1 minute. Give the eggs a good turn with a wooden spoon or a heatproof rubber spatula, then fold in the salmon and onion. Cook the eggs until they’re done to your liking, folding occasionally. Try not to overstir as the eggs cook, as this breaks them down into small curds. The eggs should remain in fluffy clumps, laced with chive-flecked onions and pieces of smoked salmon. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper to taste, then scrape them onto an individual serving plate. Sprinkle the top with additional minced chives and serve immediately, with your choice of hot toast.
