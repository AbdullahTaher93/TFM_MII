Combine the grated coconut and boiling water in a blender or food processor and pur√©e for 2 minutes. Let this mixture stand for 15 minutes. Strain the mixture through a strainer lined with several layers of dampened cheesecloth; Twist the cheesecloth tightly to extract as much milk as possible. (The process can be repeated using another 3 cups of boiling water to make a second, thinnner batch of coconut milk.) Store the coconut milk in the refrigerator, where it will keep for 3 to 4 days. It can also be frozen.
