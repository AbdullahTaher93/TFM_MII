Put the garlic cloves, basil leaves, pistachios, pine nuts, ¼ cup of the olive oil, and salt into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade and blend. Gradually pour the rest of the oil through the feed tube until all the ingredients are integrated into a paste with a slightly coarse texture. The pesto must be fluid, not hard or dry. If it is not fluid, turn the food processor back on and add more oil until you have a runny paste. Put the pesto in a large serving bowl, reserving a large spoonful. Place the butter and the cooked shrimp on top of the pesto. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Stir in a small fistful of salt, a splash of olive oil, and the bavette and cook, stirring often so the pasta doesn’t stick together, until the pasta is al dente. While the pasta is cooking, toast the almonds in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan constantly so the almonds don’t burn. Lift the pasta out of the pot and into the bowl with the pesto, butter, and shrimp. Add a splash of pasta water and toss the pasta until the butter is melted and the pasta is coated. Add the toasted almonds and toss again. A tavola! Dust with Parmesan cheese and serve very hot, with more Parmesan on the table.
