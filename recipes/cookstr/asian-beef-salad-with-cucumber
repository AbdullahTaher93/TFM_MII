Preheat the broiler. Combine the jalapeños, salt, fish sauce, sugar, rice wine, vinegar, and lime juice in a food processor or blender. Purée the mixture and set aside. Combine the scallions, mint, cilantro, and lemongrass in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside. Pat the steaks dry and coat lightly with oil. Broil the steaks for 4 minutes, or until brown and crusty on one side. Turn and broil 3 minutes more for medium-rare or 4 minutes more for medium. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Carve each steak into ¼-inch-thick slices. (The recipe may be done ahead to this point. Cover and refrigerate the sauce, herbs, and meat separately. Return to room temperature before serving.) Make a bed of cucumber slices on a platter or 2 or 3 plates. Arrange the steak over the cucumber, spoon the sauce over the steak, and scatter the herb mixture over all.
