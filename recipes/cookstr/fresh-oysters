Place the wine and vinegar in a saucepan and reduce to one-half over a medium heat. Turn off the heat and stir in the shallot, white pepper and salt as needed (oysters are naturally salty, so go light on the salt). Transfer to a bowl and let the flavours combine until cool, then pour the sauce into small ceramic ramekins or dishes for serving. When ready to serve, having first confirmed all the oysters are still firmly closed (throwaway any that are loose or already partially opened), carefully prise open (or shuck) each oyster, wearing an oyster glove if available, with an oyster knife. Be sure to retain the liquor in each shell and remove any small broken shell pieces. Place six oysters on each platter, over crushed ice. Serve immediately with either an attractive parsley sprig or strand of seaweed, a ramekin of the sauce, a small fork and a bottle of Tabasco on the side.
