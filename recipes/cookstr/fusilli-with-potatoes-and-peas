In a covered pasta pot over high heat, bring water to a rapid boil. Meanwhile, in a large saut√© pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add potatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, until potatoes are firm to the bite and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add onion, peas and oregano and cook, stirring, until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add water and cook about 1 minute. Add wine and cook until reduced by half. Remove from heat and set aside. While sauce is simmering, add salt and fusilli to boiling water and cook, uncovered, over high heat until pasta is al dente. Scoop out about 1 cup (250 mL) of the pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta. Return potato mixture to high heat. Add 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the reserved pasta water and the butter and heat through. Add fusilli and, using a wooden spoon, toss to coat evenly, adding more pasta water if necessary. Add half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano and toss well. Transfer to a large serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
