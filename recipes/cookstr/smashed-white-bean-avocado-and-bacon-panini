Preheat panini grill to high. In a bowl, combine beans, 1 tbsp (15 ml) of the oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Using a potato masher or a fork, mash the bean mixture. Set aside. Place rolls, cut side down, on a work surface and brush crusts with the remaining oil. Turn rolls over and spread bean mixture over bottom halves. Evenly layer with cucumber, bacon, onion and avocado. Cover with top halves and press gently to pack. Place sandwiches in grill, close the top plate and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately. Variations: For a meatier panini, add sliced or shaved turkey or chicken. I love the simple white bean, but any type of bean will certainly work. For a different flair, use black beans spiked with a bit of chili powder and cumin.
