Preheat oven to 325° F. Cut the chicken into ½-inch chunks and arrange them on the skewers evenly. Rest the skewers on a baking sheet covered with foil. In a nonstick skillet, roast the peanuts over medium heat until fragrant. Let them cool a little and chop them coarse. Put the nuts in a bowl and add the remaining ingredients except the cilantro. Stir well and pour the sauce over the chicken skewers. Bake for 10 minutes and serve on a platter, garnished with the cilantro leaves and whole sprigs.
