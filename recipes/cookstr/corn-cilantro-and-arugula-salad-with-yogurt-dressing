With a sharp knife, cut all the kernels from the cobs. You should have about 4 cups. In a 10-inch sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the corn, cover, and sauté 2 to 5 minutes, until tender. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl, mix the corn, arugula, radishes, coriander, and cilantro. Cover and chill for 1 hour. In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, vinegar, mustard, and salt until well blended. Gradually whisk in the remaining 1½ tablespoons of oil until emulsified, and add the chipotle, if desired. The dressing may be made ahead of time and refrigerated for up to 1 hour. Just before serving, toss the salad with half the dressing. Add more dressing to taste.
