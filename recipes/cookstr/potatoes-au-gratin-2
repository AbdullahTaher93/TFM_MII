Heat the oven to 350°F. Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (if you have a food processor use it-it makes this dish a breeze! see Love Note 3). Smear the garlic on the inside of a 13x9x2-inch baking dish (to give it the essence of garlic). Alternatively, tub the inside of 8 to 12 individual 1- to 1½-cup oven-proof dishes with the garlic. Allow the garlic juices to dry, then coat the dish with the softened butter or nonstick cooking spray. Put the potatoes, salt, pepper, and half-and-half or cream into a 6- to 8-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Lower to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally (make sure no potatoes are sticking to the bottom and getting scorched), until the liquid thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Pour the potatoes and cream into the prepared baking dish (or dishes). Press down on the top layer with a rubber spatula to submerge the potatoes. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top and press down again. Bake until the top is golden and the potatoes are tender, 45 to 60 minutes for a large baking dish, 30 to 45 minutes for small dishes. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.
