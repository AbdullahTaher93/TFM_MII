Preheat the oven to 275Â°F. In a medium saucepan, combine the cream and fresh ginger. Place over medium heat until small bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Strain through a sieve, discarding the ginger. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until pale in color. Whisk in the granulated sugar until dissolved. Whisk in the flavored cream and stir in the crystallized ginger and vanilla extract. Place six standard-size flan dishes in a baking pan. Divide the custard mixture among the dishes. Pour warm water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bakein the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the center of each custard still jiggles slightly. Remove from the oven and lift the dishes from the hot water. Let cool briefly, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. To make the fruit salad: In a large bowl, toss the kiwi fruit, pineapple, and mango. Sprinkle with the orange liqueur, if desired. Refrigerate, covered, until serving time or up to 1 day. When ready to serve, place the flan dishes on a baking sheet and evenly sprinkle 1 tablespoon brown sugar over each custard. Using a hand-held blowtorch, caramelize the sugar (see Notes).
