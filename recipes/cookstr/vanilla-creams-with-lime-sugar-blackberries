STEP 1: Bring the half-and-half, sugar, and salt just to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle 1 envelope of gelatin over the mixture and whisk until the gelatin is dissolved. Repeat with the remaining 2 envelopes. STEP 2: Pour the mixture through a fine strainer set over a large glass measure or a bowl. Whisk in the vanilla. Divide the mixture evenly among eight 6-ounce custard cups. Refrigerate, tightly covered, until set and thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours, or for up to 2 days. STEP 3: Toss together the blackberries and lime sugar in a medium bowl. Let stand for about 15 minutes, until the sugar is dissolved, or for up to 2 hours. STEP 4: To serve, gently run a table knife around the inside of each custard cup, dip the bottom of the cup in hot water for about 5 seconds, and invert the cream onto a serving plate. Spoon the blackberries and their syrup around the creams and serve.
