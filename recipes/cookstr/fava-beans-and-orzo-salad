Cook the orzo according to the package directions and drain. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Working in batches if necessary, boil the beans in their pods for 6 minutes, or until the beans inside are tender, but not mushy. Cool slightly. Remove and discard the pods. Using a small sharp knife, remove the outer skins of the beans. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 7 minutes, or until very soft. Remove from the heat and stir in the marjoram, tomatoes, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Add the beans and orzo and toss to coat well. Divide the arugula among 4 salad plates. Top with the bean salad.
