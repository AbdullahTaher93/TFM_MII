Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, mix the mayonnaise, sour cream, and egg together. Add the remaining ingredients, except for the crab, and mix until thoroughly blended. Gently fold in the crabmeat. Place in a 1Â½-quart buttered baking dish and bake 20-25 minutes, until bubbly. Serve with crackers or pita trangles.
