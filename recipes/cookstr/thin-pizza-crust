Bread Machine Method: In a large bowl or plastic bag, combine whole bean flour, sorghum flour, tapioca starch, sugar, xanthan gum, yeast, salt and oregano. Mix well and set aside. Pour water, vinegar and oil into the bread machine baking pan. Select the Dough Cycle. Gradually add the dry ingredients as the bread machine is mixing, scraping with a rubber spatula while adding. Try to incorporate all the dry ingredients within 1 to 2 minutes. Allow the bread machine to complete the cycle. Mixer Method: In a large bowl or plastic bag, combine whole bean flour, sorghum flour, tapioca starch, sugar, xanthan gum, yeast, salt and oregano. Mix well and set aside. In a separate bowl, using a heavy-duty electric mixer with paddle attachment, combine water, vinegar and oil until well blended. With the mixer on the lowest speed, slowly add the dry ingredients until combined. With a rubber spatula, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. With the mixer on medium speed, beat for 4 minutes. For Both Methods: Immediately pour onto prepared pans (see Notes). Spread evenly with a water-moistened rubber spatula. Allow to rise in a warm, draft-free place for 15 minutes. Bake in 400°F (200°C) preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until firm. Spread with your choice of toppings. Return to oven and bake according to recipe topping directions. Variations: This dough can be divided into equal portions to make eight 6-inch (15 cm) individual pizzas. Bake on greased baking sheets for 10 to 12 minutes. Use 1 tbsp (15 mL) chopped fresh oregano for the dried herb.
