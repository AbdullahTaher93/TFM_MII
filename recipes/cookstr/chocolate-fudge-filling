Place chocolate, butter and vanilla in a large heatproof bowl. Set aside. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring cream to a full boil without stirring. Once cream starts to climb up sides of pan, remove from heat and pour over chocolate. Let stand, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Whisk mixture until chocolate has fully melted and ganache is smooth. Let cool completely prior to filling donuts.
