Warm the oil in a covered soup pot on low heat. Add the onions, garlic, and salt, and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the carrots and bell peppers, increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the hot peppers, cumin, coriander, and oregano and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally so the spices wonâ€™t stick. Add the corn, tomatoes, kidney beans, and black beans. Bring the chili to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer, stirring often, for at least 30 minutes.
