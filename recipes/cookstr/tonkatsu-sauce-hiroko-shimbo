In a small saucepan, combine the Worcestershire sauce, sugar, shoyu, and ketchup. Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring, until the volume is reduced by 20 percent. Add the mustard and allspice, stirring. Remove the pan from the heat, and let the sauce cool to room temperature. The sauce will keep for one week, refrigerated in a sterilized bottle with a tight-fitting lid.
