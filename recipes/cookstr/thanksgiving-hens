Preheat the oven to 375°F; arrange the frozen sausages in a shallow roasting pan and roast until cooked through, about 18 to 20 minutes. Set the sausages aside until they are cool enough to handle; then cut them into ¼-inch slices. Reserve the pan. Turn up the heat to 475°F. Meanwhile, finely chop one onion and coarsely chop the other. Combine the sliced sausages, bread, finely chopped onion, 2 tablespoons of the butter, the sage, thyme, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Season the hens inside and out with an additional ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Stuff each hen with one fourth of the bread mixture and tie the legs. Arrange the hens on a rack in the shallow roasting pan and drizzle the wine and remaining 1 tablespoon butter over them. Roast the hens for 20 minutes. Add the coarsely chopped onion to the pan and continue roasting for 10 to 15 minutes longer, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh joint registers 170°F. Transfer the hens to a platter, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, put the roasting pan on a burner; add the broth and bring to a boil, stirring to loosen any brown bits in the bottom of the pan. Whisk together ¼ cup water and the flour; add to the roasting pan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Simmer 3 minutes. Serve the hens with the sauce.
