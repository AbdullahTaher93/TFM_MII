To Make Crumbs: By hand: Place cookies or crackers in a large heavy plastic bag. Close partially, leaving a small space for air to escape. Roll with a rolling pin until finely and evenly crushed. In a food processor: Pulse until crumbs form, being careful not to grind the cookies too fine (they should not look powdery). To Shape the Crust: Coat the pie plate well with softened, not melted, butter (keeps the pie from sticking to the pie plate, making serving easier). Pat the crumbs firmly and evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate. For a perfect shape, place another pie plate (same size) in the crust and press down gently. To Finish the Edge: Press the crumbs firmly to make a standup rim about ½-inch high. Shape the edge by pressing the riot of crumbs from the inside of the edge with the thumb and fingertips of the other hand from the outside-pinching, pressing, and fluting as you go. To set the crust, freeze for 15 minutes before baking. Bake at 350°F for 7 to 10 min.
