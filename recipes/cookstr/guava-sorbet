Cook the guavas: In a saucepan, combine the sugar and 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Peel the guavas with a paring knife or a peeler and chop into small ½-inch pieces. Add the guava to the syrup and simmer until the fruit is falling apart and separates from the seeds easily, 30 to 45 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Strain the fruit: Pass the cooked guava and syrup through a fine mesh strainer and into a stainless-steel bowl, pushing the fruit through the strainer with the back of a ladle or rubber spatula. Discard the seeds and pulp. Place the bowl of guava puree in an ice bath to chill. Add the lime juice and taste. If the puree seems overly sweet, add more lime juice or a tablespoon or two of water. Transfer the sorbet base to the refrigerator and chill for a minimum of 1 hour and up to 2 days. Churn the sorbet: Churn the sorbet in an ice cream machine according to the machine manufacturer’s directions. The sorbet is finished once it has increased in volume and it holds whisk lines from the stirring mechanism and mounds like softly whipped cream. Transfer to the freezer for 4 hours to attain a scoopable consistency. Serving Suggestions: Serve this sorbet with a crisp wafer. It is delicious with the passion-fruit curd tart or the meyer lemon curd tart Storage
