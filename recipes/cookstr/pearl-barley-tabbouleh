Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add 2 teaspoons of the salt and the barley. Stir, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the barley is tender, about 40 minutes. Drain the barley, rinse it under cold water, drain again, and place it in a large mixing bowl. Add the remaining salt, the olive oil, lemon juice, tomatoes, and herbs and toss. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
