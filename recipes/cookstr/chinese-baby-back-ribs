In a large bowl, combine ketchup, hoisin sauce, brown sugar, sherry and garlic. Stir to blend thoroughly. Add ribs, turning to coat well. Remove ribs from marinade. Divide ribs between 3 pieces of foil, placing the ribs in a single layer. Reserve remaining marinade. Place wrapped ribs in refrigerator. Marinate overnight. Allow ribs to come to room temperature before grilling. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Place ribs (still in foil wraps) on grill. Cook, uncovered, for 45 to 55 minutes or until tender. During last 15 minutes of cooking, remove ribs from foil. Place directly on grill to brown, basting with reserved marinade. Serve immediately or at room temperature.
