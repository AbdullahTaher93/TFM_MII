Place the olive oil, onion, and garlic in a heavy pot over low heat and cook, stirring, until the onions are very soft, 15 minutes. Add the cardamom, saffron, lemon juice, cinnamon stick, orange zest, broth, and salt and pepper. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, for 10 minutes. Then stir in the chickpeas, raisins, and tomatoes. Add the parsley and the ¼ cup mint and simmer, partially covered, shaking the pan occasionally; for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400°F. Remove the cinnamon stick and the orange zest from the vegetable mixture. Place the cooked vegetables in a 13 × 9-inch baking dish and arrange the halibut steaks on top. Spoon some of the vegetable liquid over the fish. Bake until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily when tested with a fork, 15 minutes. Serve the fish and vegetables over couscous and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons chopped mint.
