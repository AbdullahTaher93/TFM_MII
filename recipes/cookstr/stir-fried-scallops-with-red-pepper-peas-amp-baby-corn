To make the sauce, in a small bowl stir together the chicken broth, soy sauce, white wine or sherry, and sugar. If using the ground ginger, add it now and stir it into the sauce. In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the 1 tablespoon broth and set aside. Place a large, heavy frying pan or wok on high heat and let it get very hot, about 90 seconds. Add the oil, bell pepper, onion, and baby corn, and stir-fry until the pepper softens, about 3 minutes. Add the scallops and stir-fry until they begin to get opaque, 3-4 minutes depending on their size. Add the garlic and fresh ginger (if using) and stir-fry 1 minute more. Add the sauce and the frozen peas. As soon as the sauce starts simmering, add the cornstarch mixture and stir to combine. Continue cooking another minute or so until the sauce begins to thicken and a nice glaze begins to form on the vegetables and scallops. Serve immediately.
