In a wok or pan, heat 2½ inches of vegetable oil until it is very hot, about 365°F. Make sure the peas are dry. Blanch them in the oil in batches for 30 seconds. Drain on paper towels. In a separate wok, heat the sesame oil and sauté the ginger, garlic, green onion, and smoked pork for 4 minutes. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Mix the cornstarch and chicken stock to dissolve cornstarch; stir the mixture into the wok until the sauce is thickened and clear. Fold in the sugar snap peas. Garnish with black goma (sesame seeds) that have been toasted in a dry skillet.
