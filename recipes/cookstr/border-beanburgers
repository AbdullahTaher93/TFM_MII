Dump the beans, which will still be a bit gelatinous, into the food processor and puree, leaving a little chunky texture. Spoon the pur√©e into a bowl and mix in the remaining ingredients except the olive oil and optional ingredients. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour to firm a bit. Heat a large skillet and film the bottom with olive oil. When the skillet is hot, make 4 burgers, flatten if necessary, and cook about 3 minutes, until browned and crisp on the bottom. Flip over carefully and cook 3 more minutes, or until the second side is browned. Serve with salsa or guacamole in a low-carb tortilla or over romaine lettuce if you like.
