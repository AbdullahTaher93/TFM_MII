To make the dressing, put the wine, water, and ginger into a saucepan, and bring them to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer the ingredients ½ hour. Uncover the pan, raise the heat, and reduce the liquid until only ¼ cup remains. Pour it into a bowl, and let it cool. Add the vinegar, and whisk in the oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange the lettuce on a platter or on individual plates. Place the papaya or melon slices on top. Sprinkle the prosciutto on top, and spoon the ginger vinaigrette over all. Garnish with the watercress or parsley and red pepper, and serve.
