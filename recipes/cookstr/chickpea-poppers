Set an oven rack at the highest position and preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up. Drain the chickpeas in a large colander for about 15 minutes to get rid of as much moisture as possible. If using canned, rinse first. In a large bowl, gently mix together all the ingredients. Arrange the seasoned chickpeas in a single layer on the baking sheet. Cook for 15 minutes. Carefully take the tray out of the oven, mix gently so that the chickpeas cook evenly, and cook another 10 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with the red chile powder, cayenne pepper, or paprika.
