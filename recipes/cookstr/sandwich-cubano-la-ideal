Trim the ends off the bread loaves, then cut the loaves into 8-inch sections. Split the sections in half lengthwise. Spread mustard on the cut side of each bottom half and mayonnaise on each top half. Layer pickle slices on top of the mustard, then add layers of cheese, ham, and Puerco Asado. Place the other half of the bread on top, mayonnaise side down. Preheat a sandwich or panini press, or, if you don’t have one, preheat the oven to 350°F. Brush the tops of the sandwiches with butter. Put the sandwiches in the press (or arrange them on a nonstick baking sheet and place another baking sheet on top; weight down the baking sheet with a heavy iron skillet or a brick wrapped in aluminum foil). Press or bake the sandwiches until they are crisp and golden brown and the cheese has melted, 6 to 8 minutes. Cut the sandwiches in half on the bias and serve.
