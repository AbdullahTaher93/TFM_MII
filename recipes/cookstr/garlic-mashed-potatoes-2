Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the potatoes until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain well. Combine the milk and garlic in a saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, mash the potatoes, milk mixture, butter, salt, and pepper to the desired consistency. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary. Serve immediately.
