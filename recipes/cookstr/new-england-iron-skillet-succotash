Remove the husks and silk from the ears of corn and discard. Trim the base of each ear so it is even and flat. Working with 1 ear at a time, stand it upright on its base in a bowl. Using a sharp knife, cut down between the cob and the kernels to remove the kernels. Reserve the kernels and discard the cobs. Fill a large saucepan two-thirds full of water and bring to a boll over high heat. Add the corn and simmer for 3 minutes. Drain in a colander, then rinse under cold water until cool. Drain thoroughly, blot dry with paper towels, and set aside. In a 12-inch skillet, preferably cast iron, melt the butter over medium-high heat and swirl to coat the pan. Add the zucchinis and onion and sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes until just beginning to brown at the edges. Add the red peppers and sauté for 3 minutes longer. Add the lima beans and corn kernels. Sauté, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes until the vegetables are heated through. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, or keep warm for up to 20 minutes.
