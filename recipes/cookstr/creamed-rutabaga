Prepare ahead: The puree can be refrigerated up to 2 days and reheated. Place the rutabaga in a large saucepan with lightly salted water to cover. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook about 30 minutes, or until tender. Drain well. Return to the saucepan over a very low heat. Add the butter. Mash the rutabaga with a potato masher, then mix in the cream and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot.
