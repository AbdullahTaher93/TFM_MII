In a backyard barbecue, build a fire of seasoned hardwood or commercial charcoal. Allow the fire to blaze and then settle into hot, white ash. Position the grill rack 4 to 6 inches above the glowing coals and wipe with an oily cloth. Warm a large platter or 6 dinner plates in a 250 degrees F oven. Coat the fillets generously with oil. Place them, skinned side up, onto the rack and grills minutes. If the oil ignites, cool the flames with a little water, splashed from a cup or streamed from a squirt gun. With a long spatula, turn once and grill about 5 minutes more. Transfer the fillets from the grill to a warmed platter or dinner plates and serve them with a few raspberries sprinkled around each fillet. Pass the warm sauce separately. In a blender, puree the raspberries with the vinegar, sugar, wine, garlic, salt, and pepper. Strain the puree into a small saucepan. Over high heat, rapidly boil the puree until it is reduced to 1/4 cup. Sauce may be made ahead up to this point and completed while the fish is grilling. Cut the butter into 1-inch chunks, and whisk, a few pieces at a time into the simmering raspberry puree. Serve immediately, or transfer to an insulated thermal carafe and hold for up to an hour.
