Wash and drain the millet, then put it in a 1-quart saucepan with a lid. Add the water, cauliflower, and salt. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to the lowest simmer. Cover and cook for 35 minutes, checking and giving it a stir after 30 minutes. The millet will break open and thicken the liquid in the pot. When the millet is very soft and thick, take it off the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Use a blender for the smoothest puree, but a food processor will work almost as well. Puree until the mixture is as smooth as you can get it. Add butter or other flavorings, if desired, and serve in place of mashed potatoes.
