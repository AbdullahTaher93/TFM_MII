Place over medium heat and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Stir in the shallots and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes. Raise the heat to high. Stir in the shrimp, and cook, turning and stirring, for 3 minutes, or until the shrimp are opaque. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir in the pomegranate juice, vinegar, and salt. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, for 1 minute. Stir in the remaining sesame oil. Place ½ cup frisée on each plate. Top with shrimp and drizzle the sauce around the plate.
