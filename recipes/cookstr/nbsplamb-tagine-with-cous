Put the onion, cumin, coriander, ginger, thyme, and 1 tbsp of the oil in a large, non-metallic bowl. Add the lamb and stir well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Put the flour in a small bowl and slowly whisk in the orange juice until smooth, then set aside. Heat the remaining oil in a large, flameproof casserole over a high heat. Add the spiced lamb and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until browned. Stir the orange juice mixture into the casserole with the stock. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Cover and bake for 1 hour. Remove the casserole from the oven. Stir in the apricots. Return to the oven and bake for 20 minutes more, or until the lamb is tender. Meanwhile, prepare the couscous. Mix the couscous with salt to taste in a large heatproof bowl and add boiling water to cover by 1in (2.5cm). Cover with a folded kitchen towel and let stand for 10 minutes, or until the couscous is tender. Fluff with a fork and keep warm. When the lamb is tender, taste and adjust the seasoning. Sprinkle with mint leaves and serve with the hot couscous.
