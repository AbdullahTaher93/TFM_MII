Place the russet potatoes and sweet potato into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal cutting blade. Pulse 5 or 6 times until coarsely ground. In a large bowl, combine the cold water and 2 teaspoons of the salt. Add the potatoes and stir to coat. Drain well through a fine sieve, pushing out as much water as you can. Transfer the potatoes to a microwave-safe bowl and heat for 4 minutes. Stir and heat for another 4 minutes. Stir in the corn flour, ground millet flour, cayenne, and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Line a 9-inch square pan with parchment and pour in the potato mixture. Spread it evenly and let the mixture cool to room temperature. Chill in the freezer for 20 minutes. Once the potato mixture is frozen, cut it into 1-by-½-inch tots. Line a baking sheet with parchment and set aside. Heat at least 2 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot to 370°F. Fry the tots in batches, being sure not to crowd the pot, until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the tots with a slotted spoon and place them on the prepared baking
