Fill a pot with enough water to cover the beans. Add the onion and ham and bring to a boil. Add the beans and cook very slowly until tender, about 1 hour, or to taste. Remove from the heat and pour off all but one quarter of the water. Season the beans with salt, pepper, and vinegar. Place in a serving bowl and serve with a slotted spoon.
