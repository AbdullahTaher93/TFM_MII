Break up the romaine and place in a large salad bowl with the orange sections, onion rings, and shrimp. Blend in the rosemary with the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, and seasonings. Pour over the salad just before serving and toss well. Garnish with the parsley. Serve with toast, hot rolls, or herbed bread.
