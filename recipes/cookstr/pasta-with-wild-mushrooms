For the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the olive oil, then add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water. Drain again. For the mushroom cream: Grind the mushrooms or stems in a food processor until finely chopped but not pulverized, or mince by hand. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the olive oil until just smoking. Add the celery, carrot, and shallots and saut√© until softened but not colored, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the minced mushroom stems and chicken stock to cover, bring to a simmer, and cook 10 minutes. Add the heavy cream, return to a simmer, and cook until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Strain through a fine strainer, discarding the solids, and season with salt and pepper. To serve: Spoon the sauce into a large skillet and add the sliced mushrooms and optional truffle juice. Over medium-high heat, bring the sauce to a boil and let it reduce by about one third; it should be thick enough to coat the pasta. Add the cooked pasta, stir well, and reseason, if necessary. Garnish with parsley or chives. Variations: For tripolini, substitute cavatelli or tortellini. Use wild mushroom sauce in Pennette with Mushroom Cream, Lobster, and Asparagus.
