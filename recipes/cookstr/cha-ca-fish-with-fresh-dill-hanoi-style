To marinate the fish: in a medium bowl, combine the fish sauce, oil, ginger, turmeric, and salt and stir to mix well. Cut the fish into big bite-sized chunks (2 or 3 inches square) and add them to the bowl, tossing to coat well. Set aside while you prepare the noodles and other accompaniments, or cover and chill to marinate for up to 1 day. To cook the rice noodles: bring a medium saucepan of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Drain the soaked noodles well, drop them into the boiling water, and immediately remove from the heat. Let stand for 10 minutes, drain well, and set aside in a medium bowl. (If using angel hair pasta, cook in boiling salted water until tender but still firm, drain well, and set aside). Prepare the accompaniments so that you can serve the fish at once. To cook the fish: place the oil, dill, and green onions by the stove. Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat until a bit of dill sizzles when it hits the pan. Add the fish to the pan and cook on one side for about 2 minutes. Gently turn and let the fish cook for another minute. Add the dill and green onions to the pan and cook for another minute, tossing gently to wilt the herbs. Transfer to a serving platter. To serve this dish the classic small-bowl way, start each guest off with a small bowl holding a portion of each accompaniment: noodles, lettuce, and a few leaves of mint, cilantro, or Asian basil. Top with a piece or two of fish with dill and green onions, sprinkle with chopped peanuts, and drizzle with a spoonful of Everyday Dipping Sauce. Invite your guests to continue serving themselves in this way. To serve the big-noodle-bowl way, divide the accompaniments, fish, dill, and green onions among 4 big noodle bowls or pasta plates. Season each bowl with Everyday Dipping Sauce and invite each guest to toss with chopsticks or a fork and spoon, and enjoy.
