In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and sauté the onions until transparent, 5 to 8 minutes. Add half the broccoli and the roasted garlic and sauté until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Add the remaining broccoli and the cream. Bring to a boil and cook until the newly added broccoli is tender, about 10 minutes. Puree in a blender and strain through a coarse strainer. Season with salt and pepper and keep hot. For the shrimp and mushrooms: Preheat the oven to 200°F. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the mushroom caps and sauté until soft, about 6 minutes. Remove from the skillet. Add the shrimp to the skillet and sauté until medium-rare, 1 to 2 minutes each side. Keep warm in the oven. To serve: Put the mushrooms and shrimp in 8 warm bowls and ladle the soup over. Variations: Instead of sautéing the shrimp and mushrooms, grill the mushroom caps until golden and the shrimp until medium rare, 1 to 2 minutes each side. For chicken stock substitute half chicken, half lobster stock.
