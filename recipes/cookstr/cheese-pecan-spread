Combine all ingredients and chill 12 hours. Serve with bagel chips or water crackers. Variations: My friend Becky Loboda, Mission Hills, Kansas makes a simple dip similar to this by blending grated Monterey Jack cheese with mayonnaise (use the proportions above as a guide). She blends in a little dried minced onion, to taste, and serves it with water crackers. I do the same with Swiss cheese, ground white pepper and chives, to taste.
