1 Steam and roughly mash half the carrots, and grate the rest. Combine them together then add the remaining ingredients up to the seasoning and knead well. If the mixture is too wet, add more bread crumbs–it should be soft and slightly damp. 2 Mold the mixture into 24 small “cakes” then “dry” fry in a nonstick pan sprayed with oil until browned on both sides. 3 Serve with low-fat plain yogurt, generously flavored with red onion and cilantro.
