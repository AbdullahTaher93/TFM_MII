Sprinkle 2½ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper allover each chicken and let sit for up to 24 hours, uncovered, in the refrigerator. (If you’ve brined the chicken, skip this step. Just sprinkle the bird with ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper and proceed with the rest of the recipe.) Preheat the oven to 425°F. Set an oven rack to the middle position. Set a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat for 1½ minutes. Turn your oven vent on high; this is going to smoke. Add the oil and the butter and cook until the foam from the butter is almost gone and the butter starts to brown, about 1 minute. Add the chicken, skin side down, and cook until nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, flip the chicken, and spoon off all but about 1 tablespoon of the fat. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes, onion, bacon, thyme, and rosemary together, then scatter all around and under the chicken. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165°F to 170°F, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, return the skillet to the oven to finish browning the potatoes and onions, another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Carve the bird and serve with the potatoes, sprinkled with the parsley, if using.
