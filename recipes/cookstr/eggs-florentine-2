In a saucepan melt the butter, add the flour and stir with a wire whisk until blended. Meanwhile, bring the milk and cream to a boil and add all at once to the butter-flour mixture, stirring vigorously with the whisk until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Combine the hot drained spinach with ½ cup of the sauce and season with nutmeg. Pour the spinach mixture into a shallow casserole and arrange the eggs on top. Spoon the remaining sauce over the eggs, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and brown lightly under a broiler; or bake in a preheated 400°F oven until brown.
