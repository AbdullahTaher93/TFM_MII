Combine all the seeds in a dry frying pan over medium heat. Toast them for a minute or two, tossing frequently so they donâ€™t burn, until they are starting to brown and smell really lovely. Pam into a bowl and set aside to cool. To make the dressing, stir the lemon juice and seasonings together in a bowl and then whisk in the oil, or shake the ingredients together in a screw-top jar to combine. Put the spinach leaves in a serving bowl, drizzle over the dressing, and toss together. Scatter over about half the seeds, toss lightly again, then sprinkle the remaining seeds over and serve.
