If the tortillas are too stiff to fold in half easily, warm them for a few seconds on a griddle or in a skillet until they are pliable. Cover half of each tortilla with an equal portion of chocolate, marshmallows, and graham crackers. Fold the empty portion of the tortillas over the filled portion and secure with a toothpick. Warm on a medium-hot griddle or skillet, and cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the chocolate and marshmallows are melted and gooey, and the tortillas are crisp and golden in spots. Serve immediately, cutting each into four wedges. Offer plenty of napkins.
