Removing the stems, slice the strawberries. Place in a large bowl and mix with the honey. Let marinate for 1 hour at room temperature. To prepare the whipped cream, place the pine nuts in a food processor and pulse until completely ground. Add the honey and vanilla and mix well. If necessary, add water 1 tablespoon at a time to reach the desired cream consistency. You may need to stop the food processor several times to scrape down the sides. Just before serving, toss the strawberries with the balsamic vinegar. Top with whipped cream and serve at room temperature.
