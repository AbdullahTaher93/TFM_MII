In a large, deep saucepan, fry the onion and celery gently in the olive oil until soft. Add the borlotti beans and stir together thoroughly. Then add the parsley, green vegetables, zucchini, potato, and carrot, fry together gently, using a little of the stock to moisten. When the vegetables are all beginning to soften, add the rest of the stock, turn the heat down, and simmer slowly for about 30 minutes, stirring regularly. Add more liquid if necessary. When the vegetables are completely soft, season to taste and add the pasta. Simmer gently until the pasta is cooked. Remove from the heat, allow to stand for about 10 minutes before serving with a little freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.
