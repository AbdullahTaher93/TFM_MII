For the spice paste: Place the ginger, garlic, dried red chilies, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds in a blender. Add 1/3) cup water and pulse a few times and then grind to a smooth paste. (To get a good uniform result, you will need to stop the blender a few times and push the ingredients back down with a spoon.) Rub the spice paste onto the chicken and let rest while you prepare the remainder of the dish. For the cashew nut paste: Place the cashews and yogurt in a blender and blend into a smooth paste. Set aside. Heat the oil in a wok or skillet on medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until they begin to turn golden. Stir in the cardamom pods, cinnamon stick(s), bay leaves, and cloves and cook for a few seconds. Stir in the chicken with the spice paste and the turmeric and saut√© for 6 to 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes and green chili, if using. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Stir in the cashew nut paste and simmer for 3 minutes. You should have a soft chicken curry that is thick and golden yellow in color. Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice.
