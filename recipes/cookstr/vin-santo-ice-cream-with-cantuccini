Heat the heavy cream in one pan, the vin santo in another. Whisk the yolks and brown sugar together and, still whisking, pour first the hot vin santo and then the warmed cream into them. Pour this mixture into a good-sized pan and make a custard as normal. Allow to cool, then chill and freeze in an ice cream maker or without. Serve by scooping out into small wine glasses, giving everyone some biscotti to dip into the deep, almost incense-intense ice cream.
