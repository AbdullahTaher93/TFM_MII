To Make the Sesame Seed Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together all ingredients. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring just enough water to cover shrimp to a boil. Add shrimp and cook until they turn pink, about 2 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Cook scallops in the same way, boiling until they turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Drain and add to bowl with shrimp. Pour half of the dressing over and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to allow flavors to blend. Place peas in a colander and pour boiling water over. Drain and dry. Place in another bowl, add cucumber, and toss lightly with remaining dressing. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to allow flavors to blend. Drain peas mixture and seafood and arrange in mounds on a serving platter lined with lettuce leaves. Garnish with cherry tomatoes.
