In a small saucepan, heat butter until bubbling but not browned. In blender, on high speed, blend egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, cayenne and white pepper until smooth, about 5 seconds. With motor running, through hole in top, pour in butter in a thin stream until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Continue blending until smooth, about 5 seconds. To keep warm, place in a heatproof bowl over hot, not boiling, water. Hollandaise sauce is essential for Eggs Benedict: Place 1 slice of ham or back bacon on a toasted English muffin half, top with poached egg and smother in hollandaise sauce.
