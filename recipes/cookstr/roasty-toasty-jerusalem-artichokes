Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. If not using nonstick, spray a baking dish (large enough to hold the Jerusalem artichokes comfortably in a single layer) with cooking spray. Place the Jerusalem artichokes in the prepared baking dish. Add the oil, tossing to coat and rubbing it in a bit with your hands. Bake for about 30 minutes, then drizzle with the tamari and toss again. Bake until the Jerusalem artichokes are golden brown and soft but not mushy, about 20 minutes longer. Serve straight from the oven.
