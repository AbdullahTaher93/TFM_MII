Preheat the oven to 350°F. Slash the cut surfaces of the eggplant in a crosshatch pattern, drizzle with the olive oil and herbs, and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet, cut-side up. Bake until tender, about 1 hour. Scoop the flesh into a small bowl, mash lightly, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Slice ½ inch off the top of each tomato and scoop out the seeds and loose flesh. Fill each with 1 clove roasted garlic and about ¼ cup eggplant (or enough to fill). Arrange on a baking sheet and drizzle with a link olive oil. Sprinkle each tomato with salt and pepper. Bake until softened and heated through, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve hot. Variation: As a stuffing for bell peppers, bake 25 minutes at 350°F.
