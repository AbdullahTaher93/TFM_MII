Dump the tomatoes and juices into a large bowl, and squeeze the tomatoes into small chunks with your hands. Pour the olive oil into the skillet, toss in the onion slices and the prosciutto or bacon strips, and set over medium-high heat. Stir well, toss in the bay leaves, and cook, stirring and shaking the pan occasionally. If using bacon, start over medium heat and turn it up as the bacon releases its fat. After 5 minutes or so, when the onions have softened, drop the peperoncino strips into a clear part of the skillet, and toast them in the hot spot for a minute. Pour the crushed tomatoes into the pan; rinse out the tomato can and bowl with 1 cup of pasta-cooking water, and pour it into the skillet too. Add the salt, stir well, and rapidly bring the sauce to a boil, then lower the heat so it is bubbling steadily. Cook at a gentle boil for 8 to 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and reduced by a third or so. The onions and peppers should be cooked through but still retain their shape and texture to the bite. Remove bay leaves, then toss and cook the pasta together with salsa arrabbiata. Remove the skillet from the heat, and toss in the cheese just before serving. Good With: I like a dry pasta hereâ€”linguine, ziti, campanelle, radiatori, or capellini.
