Prep: Chop onion. Cut cabbage into quarters; cut out core. Thinly slice cabbage crosswise. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven or covered flameproof casserole over mediumhigh heat. Mix thyme, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper and rub over pork. Add pork to pot and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer pork to plate. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in pot and add onion. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion softens, about 3 minutes. In batches if necessary, add cabbage to pot, sprinkling it with balsamic vinegar. Stir in jelly and ½ cup water. Bury pork in cabbage. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer until cabbage is tender and meat thermometer inserted in center of roast reads 150°F, about 1¼ hours. Season cabbage with salt and pepper to taste. Remove pork from pot and cover cabbage to keep warm. Let pork stand 10 minutes. Carve and serve hot, with the noodles.
