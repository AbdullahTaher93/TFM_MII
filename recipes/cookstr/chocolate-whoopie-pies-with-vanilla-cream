Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C, or gas mark 4). Grease a 12-cup whoopie pie pan with coconut oil. If you don’t have a whoopie pie pan you can also use a 12-cup muffin pan. To make the whoopie pies: In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, coconut milk, coconut oil. maple syrup, almond butter, and vanilla until well combined. In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut flour, cacao powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir to combine until everything is incorporated. Carefully pour the batter into the prepared pan, making sure not to fill to: the rim. If using a muffin pan, fill the cups only one-third full. The size and look of your whoopie pies will be slightly different when using the muffin pan. Bake, for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a whoopie pie comes out clean. Allow the whoopie pies to cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes before releasing them from the pan. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. To make the cream: Remove the coconut milk from the refrigerator and carefully open the cans without shaking or turning them upside down. Carefully spoon out the layer of thick coconut cream that has gathered at the top and add to a mixing bowl. Add :the maple syrup and vanilla to the coconut cream and blend together with a hand mixer, starting on low and moving to a higher speed, until creamy. Then mix for about 5 minutes, or until you have thick, whipped peaks. Carefully cut the whoopie pies in half. On the top of the bottom half of one of the pies, place a dollop of cream and gently press the top half on top of the cream, spreading the cream to the edges of the pie. The pies are best served immediately but can be kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
