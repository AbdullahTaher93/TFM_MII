Combine the porcini and water in a small saucepan; heat to boiling, over low heat. Let stand, off heat, covered, 15 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve lined with a piece of dampened paper towel or double thickness of dampened cheesecloth; reserve the liquid (about ½ cup, depending on dryness of mushrooms; use more heavy cream if mushroom liquid is less than ½ cup). Rinse any grit from mushrooms; coarsely chop; set aside. Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, or firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Combine the pasta, mushrooms, mushroom liquid, heavy cream, and salt in a saucepan. Heat, stirring constantly, to boiling. Cook, stirring, over low heat until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the mixture is creamy, about 3 minutes. Season with pepper.
