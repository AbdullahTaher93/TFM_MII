Melt the chocolate over medium heat in a double boiler, breaking the chocolate apart and stirring it frequently. (If you donâ€™t have a double boiler, fill a saucepan partway with water, place the chocolate in a heat-safe glass bowl on top of it, and heat until the chocolate is melted.) Grease an 8-inch (20-cm) baking dish with the vegetable oil spray, then line it with parchment paper, allowing a slight overhang. Once the chocolate is melted, pour it into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the pecans, cherries, and chia seeds on top of the chocolate, add the sea salt, and chill the chocolate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, until set. When you want to serve the bars, peel the chocolate off of the parchment paper and break it into pieces.
