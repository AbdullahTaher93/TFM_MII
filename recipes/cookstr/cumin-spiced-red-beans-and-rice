Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, jalape√±os, celery, garlic, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, cayenne, and black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add the beans and cook 10 minutes longer, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to blend. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve the beans on top of the rice, sprinkled with the cilantro.
