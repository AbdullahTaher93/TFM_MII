Trim off the ends of the okra and make a slit in one side of each okra pod without cutting through. Set aside in a bowl. In a small bowl, combine the salt, turmeric, garam masala, cumin, amchur, fennel, chile powder, and coriander. Stuff the spice mixture into the slits in the okra. Sprinkle the remaining mixture (if any) over the okra and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Stir and set aside. Place a nonstick sauté pan over medium heat and add the remaining 4 tablespoons (50 ml) oil. When small bubbles appear at the bottom of the pan, add the kalonji and sauté for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add the shallots and sauté for 1 minute. Add the stuffed okra and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the besan and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes. Lower the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes or until the okra is tender. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot as a side dish.
