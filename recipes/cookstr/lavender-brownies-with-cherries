Preheat the toaster oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch by 8-inch baking dish. In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, cherries, walnuts, and lavender flowers. Melt the butter in the microwave in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in the cocoa. Blend in the sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix thoroughly. Pour the batter into the baking pan. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until done. Cool and dust with icing sugar.
