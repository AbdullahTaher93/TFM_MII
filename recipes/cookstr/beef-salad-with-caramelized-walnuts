Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Toss the beets with 1 tbsp of the oil and season. Wrap each in aluminum foil. Place on a baking sheet and roast 45 minutes, or until tender. Unwrap and let cool. Peel and cut each beet into eighths. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Rub the beef with 1 tbsp of the olive oil and season. Cook the beef, turning, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a roasting pan and roast until a meat thermometer reads 125°F (52°C) for medium-rare. Leave for 15 minutes before carving. Reduce the temperature to 400°F (200°C ). Toss the walnuts with the honey and sugar and season with salt. Spread on a baking sheet. Bake 3 minutes, until glazed. Transfer to a plate and cool. Meanwhile, to make the horseradish cream, stir the créme fraîche, horseradish, and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Toss the arugula with the vinegar and remaining oil. Season, and spread on a serving platter. Add the beets and walnuts, and sprinkle with chives. Slice the beef thinly and arrange on the salad. Serve with horseradish cream on the side.
