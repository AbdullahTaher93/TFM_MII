Combine the olives, capers, anchovies, garlic and zest, if using, in the container of a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine. Gradually add the olive oil, you can make this a very smooth puree or keep some texture. Add pepper to taste and the Cognac, if using. Store the tapenade, covered, in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before using. Variations: Tapenade vinaigrette: Thin ½ cup tapenade with ¼ cup olive oil and 2 tablespoons mild white wine or Champagne vinegar. Tapenade citrus dressing: If you have added lemon or orange zest and want to play up the citrus, thin the tapenade with 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice. Both of the above variations are good slathered on grilled vegetables, cooked tuna, and hard-boiled eggs, tossed in rice salads, and drizzled on roasted peppers and mozzarella salads, broccoli and cauliflower, orange and celery or fennel seeds, and oranges and beets. Tapenade mayonnaise: Fold ½ cup tapenade into ½ cup mayonnaise. Excellent on sliced chicken and leg of lamb sandwiches, and great for egg salad.
