If using chanterelles and creminis, cut them in half; leave the shiitake and oyster mushrooms whole. Toss all the mushrooms in the oil to coat completely. Season with salt and pepper. On a well-oiled grill or grilling rack, cook the mushrooms over medium-hot coals for 3 to 9 minutes, or until soft and lightly browned, turning as necessary. Remove the mushrooms as they cook and keep warm. Brush each slice of bread on both sides with a little oil and lightly grill. Place 2 radicchio leaves on 3 pieces of bread. Top with the mushrooms and onion sprouts. Top with the remaining bread, cut in half, and serve.
