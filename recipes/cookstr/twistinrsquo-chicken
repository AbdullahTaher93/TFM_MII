Cut the chicken lengthwise into ½-inch-wide strips. Mix together the lemon juice and cornstarch, then mix in the egg whites; set aside. For the breading: Combine the breadcrumbs, cheese, zest, and salt in a low, wide dish or zip-top bag. Dip the chicken in the egg mixture and then into the breading mixture. Place onto a plate and set aside. Heat a sauté pan on medium heat and add the oil. Sauté the chicken strips until golden on both sides. Variations Try lime or orange juice and zest instead of lemon. Use turkey breast in place of chicken.
