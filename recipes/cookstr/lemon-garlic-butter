Heat the lemon juice and garlic together in a small saucepan over medium heat until beginning to steam. Whisk in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, making sure each addition is incorporated before continuing, until you have a smooth sauce. Serve right away, or set aside in a warm spot for up to 30 minutes and whisk to smooth before serving.
