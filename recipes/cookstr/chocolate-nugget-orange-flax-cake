Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter and flour a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, combine the flours, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and granulated sugar. Stir to blend. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and stir in the oil, buttermilk or yogurt, honey, orange juice concentrate, and orange zest. Add to the dry ingredients and mix just until blended. Mix in the flax cereal and currants or raisins. Turn into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Toss the nuts and chocolate chips together and sprinkle evenly over the top. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack. Serve warm, cut into squares or strips.
