Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Put the chicken into the stoneware. Prepare the vegetables, and place on top of the chicken. Pour in the broth, and add the spices. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or on high for 4 hours, or until the chicken is completely cooked and has begun to shred. Before serving, stir in the sour cream, and heat on high for 30 minutes, or until hot. Serve over pasta or brown rice.
