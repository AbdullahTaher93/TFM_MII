Massage a little bit of the oil into the steak, and lightly season both sides with black pepper. If your skillet is not large enough to hold the steak, cut it crosswise into two pieces and cook them one at a time. Heat a large, dry, nonstick skillet over high heat for about 1 minute. When the pan is very hot, sear the steak quickly on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes a side for medium-rare, longer for medium. Remove the steak to a platter. Pour any pan juices over the meat. Season the meat generously with fine sea salt, and let it rest for 5 minutes (to allow the juices to retreat back into the beef). Carve the steak across the grain. Serve immediately, with a lemon wedge if desired. An unusual wine worth sampling at Le Mauzac is a little-known Gaillac from France’s southwest: Domaine Robert Plageoles’s syrah, a young delight that goes well with the wine bar’s meaty fare.
