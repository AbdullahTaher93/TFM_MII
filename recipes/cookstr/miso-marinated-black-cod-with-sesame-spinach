Heat the brown sugar with ¼ cup water in a small saucepan, stirring, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Cool for 10 minutes, then stir in the miso, mirin, and sake to make a smooth paste. Coat the black cod with the miso paste, cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or as long as 2 days. To cook, preheat the broiler to high with a rack set in the upper third of the oven. Place the marinated black cod on a lightly oiled baking sheet and broil until the fish is fully cooked and the surface is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. (Alternatively, the fish can be baked in a preheated 450°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes.) Center the fish on a serving plate, and place a small bundle of the sesame spinach to the side. Drizzle some of the remaining sesame dressing around the fish and plate.
