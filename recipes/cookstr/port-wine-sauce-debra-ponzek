In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the wine to a boil with the bay leaf and peppercorns and reduce by three quarters. It should have a syrupy consistency. Strain. Mix in the butter bit by bit, add the vinegar, and season with salt and pepper. Variation: For a less sweet sauce, add a touch of Veal Stock, Vegetable Stock, or low-salt canned vegetable broth, after reducing.
