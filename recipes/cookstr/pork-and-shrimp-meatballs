1 In a rood bowl, combine the shrimp, pork, chopped lemongrass, chiles, ginger, sesame oil, and lime leaf. Run the mixture through a meat grinder and return to the bowl. (Or, if using a food processor, pulse to mix. It is better with a rather coarse mixture than a mushy one.) 2 Using a sharp knife, quarter the whole lemongrass stalks lengthwise, making sure that each “skewer” holds together at the bottom. Divide the shrimp mixture into 8 portions. Rub each lemongrass skewer between your palms until it gives off a fresh smell, but not so much as to disintegrate. Wrap one portion of the meat mixture around each piece of lemongrass. 3 Heat a little oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the skewers and and cook for 6 to a minutes, turning several times, until golden brown and cooked through. Variation: If you want more sesame flavor, roll the patties in sesame seeds before frying. This is not recommended if you are grilling, as the sesame seeds have a tendency to pop when exposed to high heat, but frying over medium heat works fine. They will then need a slightly longer cooking time.
