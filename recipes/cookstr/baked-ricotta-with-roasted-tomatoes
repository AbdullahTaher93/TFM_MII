Prepare Ahead: The dish is best served hot, but it can also be baked up to 4 hours in advance and served at room temperature. Position a broiler rack 6in (15cm) from the source of heat and preheat the broiler. Place the red pepper on the rack and broil, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes, until the skin is charred and blistered. Transfer to a plate and cool. Peel and discard the ribs and seeds. Cut the pepper into thin strips. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Lightly oil a small baking dish. Reserve 2 tomato halves and place the remaining tomato halves in the dish, cut sides up. Drizzle with 2 tbsp olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 7–10 minutes until the tomatoes soften. Remove the dish from the oven and set aside. Cut the ricotta cheese in half crosswise. Remove the tomatoes from the dish. Place the bottom half of the ricotta, cut side up, in the dish and season lightly with salt and pepper. Arrange the pepper strips on top, then the tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil and top with the remaining ricotta, cut side down. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and drizzle with a little extra oil. Return to the oven and bake for 15 minutes until the cheese is hot and the top is golden.
