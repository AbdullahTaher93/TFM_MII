If you don’t want to make thc butter log, just chill the butter in a how) covered with plastic (it won’t look as good, but the butter is going to melt in the oven anyway). Preheat the oven to 425°F. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large pall, and sauté the cabbage and scallions over medium heal until tender, about 6 minutes.
