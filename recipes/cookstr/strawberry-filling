In a heavy saucepan, heat strawberries and sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly, until juices are released and begin to boil. Remove from heat and, using a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, press pulp through to strain seeds from mixture. Return juice to saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and cold water to make a milky substance. Pour into boiling juice, whisking to incorporate. Cook, whisking, until no longer cloudy. Add food coloring and cook, whisking, until mixture is thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in lemon juice. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Cover and refrigerate until chilled prior to using.
