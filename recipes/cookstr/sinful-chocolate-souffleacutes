Prep: Take your eggs and butter out of the refrigerator a couple of hours before you plan to prepare the soufflés. To Prepare the Soufflé Base: Sift the bread flour. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a mixing bowl (if using a hand mixer), mix together the butter and sugar. Add in the sifted flour, stirring until it is barely mixed together. The mixture should have a coarse, clumpy appearance. Transfer this mixture to a clean mixing bowl and set aside. To Make the Soufflés: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Using a pastry brush, line the ramekins with softened butter and then sprinkle them with the ¼ cup granulated sugar for sprinkling. Pour out any excess sugar that doesn’t stick to the butter. In a saucepan, bring the milk and vanilla paste to a boil. Add the soufflé base to the pan, and whisk the mixture together rapidly for about 20 seconds. Remove the mixture from heat and transfer to a medium mixing bowl. Gently stir in the egg yolks. Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and set aside. Combine the remaining granulated sugar, corn starch, and cocoa powder. In a clean mixing bowl, whip the egg whites and salt together until the mixture forms stiff peaks. Fold* the granulated sugar-cocoa powder mixture into the whipped egg whites. Then, fold the soufflé mixture into the combined egg white-cocoa powder mixture. Pour the mixture into the ramekins until each is ¾ of the way full. Bake at 400°F for about 15 minutes, and the soufflés have risen high beyond the ramekins’ rims.
