Cut the plantains crosswise into 2½-inch pieces. Make a lengthwise cut in each and peel off the skin. Cut the plantains on the diagonal into ½-inch slices. Pour the oil to a depth of ½ inch in a heavy frying pan and heat to 325°F. Add the plantain slices and fry until soft, about 2 minutes per side, turning once. Transfer the plantains with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Mix the ingredients for the herb salt in a small mixing bowl. Just before serving, heat the oil to 375°F. Using a tostone maker, tortilla press, meat pounder, or other heavy object, flatten each plantain slice until 1/8 to ¼ inch thick. The thinner the tostone, the crisper it will be. Fry the tostones until crisp and golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle the tostones with the herbed salt and serve at once.
