1 In a food processor, blend together the cilantro leaves and stalks, mint leaves, salt, garlic, and chiles to make a rough paste. Add the lime juice, sugar, ginger, and fish sauce, and blend until fairly smooth. Spoon the sauce into a heatproof bowl and combine with the salmon, then marinate for 20 minutes. 2 Boil some water in the bottom half of a steamer. Place the bowl with the marinated salmon in the top half and steam for 6-8 minutes. 3 Serve immediately with the rice or noodles and vegetables.
