Sift the flour and baking powder together into a bowl. Stir in the suet, then the currants, bread crumbs, sugar, and lemon zest. Stir in the milk, adding more, if needed, to make a soft dough similar to biscuit dough. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and shape into a log about 6in (18cm) long. Lightly butter a 12in (30cm) sheet of aluminum foil. Place the log at one end of the foil, and roll it up. Twist the ends closed to make a packet that resembles a party favor. Place a steamer rack in a large saucepan and add enough water to clear the rack. Bring to a boil. Place the foil packet in the steamer. Cover and steam over medium-low heat for about 1½ hours, until the pudding is cooked through. Transfer to a platter, remove the foil, and slice. Serve hot, with créme Anglaise.
