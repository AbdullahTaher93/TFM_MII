Place flour and salt in the mixer bowl. Attach the flat beater and mixer bowl to the mixer. Set to stir and mix briefly. Add eggs and mix until dough forms large clumps. Using your hands, form dough into a ball. If dough is shaggy and dry, and won’t form a ball, add 1 tsp (5 ml) water and mix until incorporated. If it’s too sticky, add 1 tbsp (15 ml) flour and mix until incorporated. If necessary, keep adding water or flour in small increments and mix until dough comes together. Remove the flat beater and attach the dough hook to the mixer. Set to speed 2 and knead for 2 minutes, until dough comes together in a firm ball. Remove dough and wrap in plastic wrap. Let rest for 20 minutes before rolling out.
