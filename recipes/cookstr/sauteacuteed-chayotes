Peel and seed the chayotes and cut into Â½-inch dice. Place in a medium-size saucepan, cover with cold water, bring to a boil over high heat, and cook for 5 minutes. Have ready a large bowl filled with ice water. Drain the chayotes and quickly plunge into the ice bath to stop the cooking. Drain well. Set aside in a bowl. With a mortar and pestle or the flat of a heavy knife blade, crush the garlic to a paste with the oregano and salt. Toss well with the diced chayotes. Let stand until ready to serve. In a medium-size skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until rippling. Add the chayotes with the garlic mixture that clings to them and cook, stirring constantly, until the moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Serve at once.
