Trim and slice the zucchini into sticks. Trim the broccolini, slicing through any thicker stems. De-seed and finely slice the bell pepper. Cook the pasta in boiling water until tender. Steam the vegetables for 10 minutes, or until tender--you may be able to save energy by putting the steamer over the pasta pan. Finely chop half of the parsley and leave the rest whole. Mix the oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper together. To serve, toss the pasta with the warm vegetables, chopped parsley, and dressing. Garnish with the reserved parsley sprigs.
