Rinse the lentils well, cover them with hot water, and set them aside while you prepare everything else. Warm the butter and olive oil in a wide skillet or sauté pan and add the onion, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, marjoram, and half the parsley. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions have begun to color. Stir in the tomato purée; then add the wine. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Drain the lentils and add them to the wine with the water, and lightly salt. Return to a boil; then lower the heat, cover the pan, and simmer until the lentils are tender, about 40 minutes. When the lentils are done, taste for salt, add a dash of vinegar to sharpen the flavors, and stir in the additional butter. Pepper generously, garnish with the remaining parsley, and serve with or without the bread.
