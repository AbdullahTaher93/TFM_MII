Using a box grater, grate the kernels from 5 ears of corn into a bowl. Press the grated corn through a fine sieve, reserving the “milk” and discarding the grated corn and the cobs. Cut the kernels from the remaining ears of corn. Combine the corn kernels, ¼ cup water, salt, and pepper in a medium pan. Cover the pan and steam over medium-low heat, stirring once or twice, until the corn is tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, then set the corn aside. Stirring constantly, bring the corn “milk” to a simmer over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, continuing to stir, until the “milk” thickens, about 3 minutes. Add the cooked corn, salt, pepper, and butter (if using) and cook until the corn is heated through. Serve warm.
