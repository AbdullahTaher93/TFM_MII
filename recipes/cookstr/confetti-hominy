Cook the bacon in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until crisp and browned, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, leaving the fat in the pan. Add the onion and bell pepper to the pan, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the reserved bacon, hominy, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, and cook to blend the flavors, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
