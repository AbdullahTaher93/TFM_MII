In a large bowl, blend all the ingredients by hand until thoroughly combined. Divide the dough in half and shape directly on Teflex sheets into two long rectangles, slightly mounded in the center. Slide the Teflex sheets onto dehydrator screens and dehydrate at 115°F for 2 to 3 hours, or until the outsides feel dry. Remove the dough from the dehydrator and cut into bars about ¾ inch wide. Place them directly onto the dehydrator screens and dehydrate further for 12 hours or more, until slightly crisp.
