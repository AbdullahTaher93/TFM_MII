Preheat broiler In a large frying pan, heat olive oil with pepper and salt over high heat for 1 minute. Add onions and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until softened and starting to brown. Add lemon zest and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Immediately add tomatoes and oregano; stir-fry 2 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to break up and a sauce starts to form. Add lemon juice, capers and the shrimp; stir-fry for exactly 1 minute, turning the shrimp so that they are light pink on both sides and all the ingredients are well mixed together. Transfer contents of the pan to an ovenproof dish, spreading everything into a flat layer. Sprinkle feta crumbles evenly to cover the entire surface. Broil 6 to 7 minutes until the feta is quite brown and the juices are bubbling up around the perimeter of the dish. Bring the dish immediately to table and scoop out portions, garnishing them with chopped parsley.
