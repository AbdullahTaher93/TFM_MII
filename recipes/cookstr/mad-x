Follow These Steps: Put the broth in a small saucepan. Heat on medium-high and bring to a full, though not out-of-control, boil. Combine the xanthan gum and warm water (or cornstarch and warm water). Be particularly mindful when using the xanthan; use a fork and keep the water moving vigorously while slowly sprinkling in the gum. Pour the gum mixture into the boiling liquid. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 1 minute. Pour into a heatproof container; cover and reserve for use in various emulsified preparations throughout the book. It'll last for a few days, well refrigerated. Pour the gum mixture into the boiling liquid. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 1 minute.
