Butter a baking dish—round, oval, or oblong—about 9 × 12 inches. Lay a layer of sliced celery root in the bottom. Dot this with butter and give it a dash of salt and another layer of thinly sliced potatoes. Alternate until you have a top layer of potatoes. Dot with butter and add a cup to 1½ cups broth or bouillon. Cover the pan and place in a 350-degree oven for 45 minutes. Remove the cover and test for doneness. If the potatoes and celery root are tender, add 1 cup grated cheese and return to the oven uncovered and let the mixture cook another 10 to 15 minutes. If they need more cooking before adding the cheese, return them to the oven uncovered and add the grated cheese when the vegetables are tender.
