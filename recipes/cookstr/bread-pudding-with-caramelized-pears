Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) Trim crusts from bread; butter one side of each bread slice. Cut into 4 triangles each; layer in prepared baking dish, overlapping the triangles. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, 1/3 cup (75 mL) of the sugar and vanilla. Whisk in hot milk in a stream, stirring constantly. Pour over bread. In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, cook the remaining sugar and 2 tbsp (25 mL) water, stirring occasionally, until mixture turns a deep caramel color. Immediately add pears and nutmeg (be careful of spatters). Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until pears are tender and sauce is smooth. Stir in raisins; spoon evenly over bread slices. Sprinkle almonds over top. Place baking dish in roasting pan; add enough boiling water to reach halfway up sides of dish. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until custard is set in center. Remove from water bath; place on rack to cool.
