At least 4 hours (and as much as 24 hours) before cooking, cut down along both sides of the backbone of the guinea hen and remove it. Rinse the hen in cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle both sides of the hen with 1 tablespoon salt and all the herbs, rubbing them allover the bird. Lay the hen flat on a plate, cover loosely with waxed paper, and refrigerate. When you are ready to cook the guinea hen, preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Brush most of the salt and herbs off the guinea hen and pat dry with paper towels. Lay the hen, skin side up, on a rack in a roasting pan and brush the skin with a little olive oil. Pour the water into the pan. Roast until skin is crispy and well browned, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, transfer the hen to a plate, and let rest for 10 minutes. About 15 minutes before the hen is ready to remove from the oven, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and most of the juices they release have been reabsorbed, about 10 minutes. Remove the rack from the roasting pan and put the pan on the stove top over medium heat. Add the port and deglaze the pan, stirring with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Pour the deglazed pan juices into the skillet holding the mushroom mixture and stir to mix well. Spoon the mushroom mixture onto a serving platter. Cut the hen into serving pieces, arrange the pieces on top of the mushrooms, and serve.
