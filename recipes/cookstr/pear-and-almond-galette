Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) Place pear quarters on their sides. Using a paring knife, carefully cut 4 slices lengthwise through the pear, trying to keep the pear intact at the end (see Notes). In a shallow saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 2 cups (500 mL) water and ¼ cup (50 mL) sugar. Bring liquid to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low. Carefully add pears and lemon juice to liquid. Cover pan and simmer for 5 minutes or until softened. Uncover and set aside. On a large piece of parchment paper lightly dusted with flour, roll out dough into a 13-inch (32.5 cm) circle, dusting parchment and dough as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Slide parchment and dough onto baking sheet. Spread almond filling in center of pastry, leaving a 1½-inch (4 cm) border. Remove pears from liquid and blot dry with a paper towel. Discard liquid. Gently fan pear quarters without separating. Starting in the center of the tart, place fanned pears in a circular pattern, forming a circle. Separate remaining pears into individual slices and place in a circular pattern around the circle of fanned pears. (Don’t worry if some of the filling shows.) Gently fold up edges of dough about 3 inches (7.5 cm) toward center over pears, pleating as necessary. Brush dough with cream, sealing well at pleats, and sprinkle 1½ tbsp (22 mL) granulated sugar over top. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until pastry is nicely golden brown and filling is puffed. Let cool on baking sheet on a wire rack for 30 minutes before serving. If desired, dust cooled tart with confectioners sugar before serving. Variation For a nice finish and bit of extra flavor, just before serving brush the pears with sieved apricot jam.
