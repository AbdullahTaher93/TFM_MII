Cut the plantains into diagonal slices about ½ inch thick. In a medium bowl, combine the ginger, cloves, cayenne, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in the water to form a paste. Add the plantain slices and toss to coat well. Let stand 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200°. 3. Pour enough vegetable oil into a large skillet to reach ½ inch up the sides. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. (An electric skillet set at 350° works well.) In batches, fry the plantain slices, turning once, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried plantains to a paper towellined baking sheet, and keep warm in the oven while frying the remaining plantains. Serve warm.
