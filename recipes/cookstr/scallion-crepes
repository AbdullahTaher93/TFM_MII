Place the eggs, sugar, and salt in a bowl and whisk until the sugar and salt dissolve. Whisk in the milk and ½ cup of water to blend well, then add the flour and whisk just to mix. If the batter looks lumpy, strain it into another bowl. Whisk in the scallions and sesame oil. The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If it is too thick, thin it with a little more water. Lightly spray a 5-inch crêpe pan with oil (or brush it with a little butter or more sesame oil) and heat over medium heat (when the pan is hot enough, a drop of water placed in it will evaporate in 2 to 3 seconds). Off the heat, add 2 tablespoons of the crêpe batter to the pan all at once. Gently tilt and rotate the pan to form a thin 4-inch round crêpe. Return the pan to the heat and cook the crêpe until lightly browned on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side, turning with a spatula. As the crêpes are done, stack them on top of one another on a plate. For best results, spray the pan lightly with oil between crêpes.
