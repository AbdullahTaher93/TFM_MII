Cut down the belly side of the lobster tail and remove the meat. Remove all fibrous or dark-colored membranes and cut the meat into bite-size pieces. Refrigerate until ready to use. Cut the lobster shell into 4 pieces. Heat the butter and oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and shallots and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes with juice, clam juice or broth, vermouth, and the lobster shells. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove and discard the lobster shells. Add the thyme, paprika, lime zest, and cream, if using. Cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until reduced by one-third. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Add the lobster meat and clams to the sauce. Season to taste with the salt, black pepper, and red or chipotle pepper. Cover and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the clams open and the lobster turns opaque. Discard any unopened clams. While the seafood is simmering, cook the pasta according to package directions, adding the chard during the last minute of cooking time. Drain and place in a large bowl. Pour the seafood sauce over the pasta and chard. Variation: If you don’t want to bother with lobster, substitute ¾ pound shrimp or scallops.
