Cut the orange rounds into quarters and put half of them in a large pitcher, along with the apple and pineapple chunks, sugar, and a splash of the Grand Marnier. Add the wine, pineapple juice, and the remaining Grand Marnier. Stir well, then chill for at least a half hour to let the flavors come together. Just before serving, add the club soda. Pour into wine glasses over ice if desired, making sure each glass gets chunks of the fruit as well as sangria. Garnish with the remaining orange wedges.
