Pour the rice bran onto a piece of wax paper, newspaper, or parchment and dredge both sides of each fillet in it. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 9-inch saut√© pan over high heat until it shimmers. Reduce the heat to medium and place two fillets in the pan. Cook for a minute or two on each side. Move to a paper-towel-lined plate. Add more oil to the pan and repeat with the remaining fish fillets. Serve with the lemon wedges.
