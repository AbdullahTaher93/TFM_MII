Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease and lightly flour the baking pan. Put the sugar, molasses, oil, and eggs in a mixing bowl and beat until smooth. In another bowl, combine the salt, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, flour, and baking soda and stir with a fork until well mixed. Stir into the first mixture. Add the boiling water and beat briskly until smooth. This is a thin batter. Pour into the pan and bake 40 to 45 minutes. Serve warm.
