To make the aioli, in a saucepan, bring the tangerine juice to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until reduced to a little more than 1 cup, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Combine the egg yolks, garlic, and lemon juice in a blender or food processor. Process at medium-high speed to blend, then very slowly add the 2Â¼ cups olive oil in a thin stream through the pouring hole while the machine is running. When the mixture has thickened, turn off the machine, add the reduced tangerine juice, and pulse until well mixed. Add the salt and pepper. If the aioli is too thick, add a little water. Refrigerate while you prepare the asparagus. Prepare a fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to high. Bring a saucepan three-fourths full of salted water to a boil. Snap off the tough end of each asparagus spear and with a vegetable peeler or paring knife peel halfway up the stalk. Add the asparagus to the boiling water and blanch for 3 to 4 minutes. While the asparagus is cooking, pour ice water into a large bowl. Drain the asparagus and immediately immerse in the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain again. Brush the asparagus with olive oil and season with the salt and pepper. Grill until tender-crisp, about 2 minutes on each side. Let cool. To serve, top with the aioli.
