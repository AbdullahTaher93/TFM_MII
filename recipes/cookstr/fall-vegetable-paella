In a large wok or saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic. Saut√© for 5 minutes or until onions are soft. Stir in rice and Turmeric Spice Paste. Reduce heat and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Stir in 2 cups (500 mL) of the stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 cup (250 mL) of the stock, zucchini, green and red bell peppers, mushrooms, cauliflower, broccoli, carrot, salt and pepper, to taste. Cover and simmer gently for 10 minutes or until rice is soft and vegetables are tender-crisp without lifting the lid. Serve hot.
