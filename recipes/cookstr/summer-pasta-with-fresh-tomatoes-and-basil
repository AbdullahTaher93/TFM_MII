Prepare the croutons: In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat. Place bread on baking sheet. Pour garlic butter over bread, tossing with a spatula to distribute butter evenly. Spread out bread cubes. Bake in preheated oven until crispy and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. Prepare the pasta: Roll pasta to setting 5 and cut with the fettuccine cutter. Set aside on a floured baking sheet. In a large bowl, toss tomatoes, garlic, oil, vinegar, salt, hot pepper flakes and black pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired with salt, hot pepper flakes and vinegar. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and cook, stirring for the first minute to keep noodles from sticking together, until al dente (tender to the bite), about 3 minutes. Drain, reserving about ½ cup (125 ml) of the cooking water. Add pasta to the bowl of tomatoes. Toss and add enough of the cooking water to moisten. Add croutons and basil and toss again. Serve immediately.
