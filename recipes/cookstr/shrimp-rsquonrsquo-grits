To make the grits: Combine 4 cups of water, the milk, and salt in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil and slowly whisk in the grits. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the saucepan and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in the cheddar cheese. Cover and keep warm over a low heat. To make the shrimp: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring, until the mixture is dark and golden, about 5 minutes. Add the bell peppers, onions, jalapeños, garlic, ½ teaspoon of the salt, and pepper. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the cream. Once the cream is fully incorporated, slowly whisk in the tomatoes and 2?3 cup of water. Stir in the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are just opaque, about 5 minutes. Season the shrimp with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and Tabasco. Serve the shrimp over the grits and garnish with the Parmesan cheese and parsley.
