For the Vegetable Stock: Place all the ingredients in a large soup pot. Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer gently over low heat for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the vegetables are quite tender. Strain the stock through a fine mesh strainer. Discard the solids or puree them and add to soup for a thicker consistency. Combine the stock and kombu in a 2-quart saucepan or small soup pot. Bring to a simmer. Dissolve the desired amount of miso in just enough warm water to make it pourable. Stir into the broth and remove from the heat. Let stand for 30 minutes or serve at once, removing and discarding the kombu just before serving. Variations: Embellish miso broth with any of the following; • Diced tofu • Cooked Asian noodles • Finely chopped scallions • Grated fresh daikon radish or white turnip • Crisp cucumber, seeded and grated
