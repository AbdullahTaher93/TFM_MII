Rinse off the hijiki quickly under cold running water. Put it to soak in 4 cups of warm water for 30 minutes. Lift the hijiki out of the water, leaving all the grit behind, then rinse it off again. Rinse off the mushrooms quickly and leave to soak in 3 cups warm water for 30 minutes. Drain the mushrooms and remove the hard stems. Cut the mushroom caps into 1/8-inch-thick strips. Heat the oil in a skillet over a medium flame. When hot, put in the hijiki, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and carrot. Saut√© for 1 minute. Add the dashi, salt, sugar, mirin, and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer. Cover, lower heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Remove cover, turn up the flame a bit and boil off most of the liquid, stirring gently as you do so. This last step should take just a few seconds.
