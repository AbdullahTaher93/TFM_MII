Prepare ahead The potatoes can be peeled, sliced, and stored in water to cover for several hours. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter a 2qt (2 liter) shallow baking dish. Peel the potatoes. Using a mandoline, a food processor fitted with a fine slicing blade, or a large knife, slice the potatoes into rounds about 1/8 in (3mm) thick. Rinse the slices in cold water. Drain and pat dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Place the potatoes in layers in the baking dish, seasoning with salt and pepper as you go. Bring the cream, garlic, and nutmeg to a boil in a saucepan. Pour the cream over the potatoes. Dot the top with the butter. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake about 1¼ hours, or until the potatoes are just tender. Remove the foil. Increase the oven temperature to 450°F (250°C) and bake until the top is golden, about 10 minutes. Serve hot. Good with salad for supper, or as a side dish to smoked fish or broiled or roasted meats. Variation Potato and Cheese Gratin Add 2 finely chopped anchovies to the cream at step 4. Sprinkle 1 cup shredded Gruyére cheese, between the potato layers, saving a little for sprinkling on the top.
