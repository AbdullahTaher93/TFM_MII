Combine the chicken, onion, carrot, parsley, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a large saucepan with water to cover by about 2 inches. Cover loosely and bring to a gentle boil (a few bubbles). Use a spoon to skim off and discard any foamy surface residue. Cook until the chicken is opaque throughout, about 30 minutes. Use tongs to remove the chicken to a plate. Remove and discard any skin. As soon as it is cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones. Cut the chicken into the size needed for the recipe and refrigerate for up to overnight, if not using immediately. Return the bones to the broth. Continue cooking the broth, uncovered, for at least another 30 minutes. Taste the broth (after cooling it on the spoon), and if it has a good chicken flavor, strain the broth into a large bowl. Discard the bones and seasonings. (Any salt and pepper will be added when the broth is added to a filling.) The broth is ready to use or it can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Or, the broth can be sealed in freezer containers and frozen for up to 1 month.
