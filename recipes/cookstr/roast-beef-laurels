Preheat oven to 450°F. Process the garlic in a blender or a food processor fitted with a steel blade to a purée. Add 1 teaspoon salt to the garlic and process to a paste. Pat the garlic paste in an even layer over the top and sides of the roast. Place the bay leaves evenly over the garlic. Place the trimmed strip of fat over the garlic and bay leaves. Tie in place with kitchen string. Sprinkle the roast all over with salt and pepper. Place in a roasting pan; pour the red wine in the bottom of the pan. Roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350°F. Roast about 18 minutes per pound for rare or 22 minutes per pound for medium done. Let stand 5 minutes before carving.
