In a bowl, whisk egg yolks with 6 tbsp (90 mL) sugar until thickened and pale yellow. Set aside In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, heat milk until bubbles appear around the edge. Gradually whisk into egg mixture, stirring constantly. Return entire mixture to the saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Be careful not to let it boil. Strain into a clean large bowl. Let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until completely cold or overnight. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat, cook grapes, juice and remaining sugar, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thickened. Let cool. In a food processor or blender, purée grape mixture with chilled custard until smooth. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer’s instructions.
