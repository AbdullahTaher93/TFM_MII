Preheat the oven to 275Â°F. In a medium bowl, dissolve the espresso or coffee granules in the hot water and stir in the cream. In another medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until pale in color. Whisk in the light brown sugar until dissolved. Whisk in the espresso mixture and the Kahlua or brandy. Place six standard-size flan dishes in a baking pan. Divide the custard mixture among the dishes. Pour warm water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the center of each custard still jiggles slightly. Remove from the oven and lift the dishes from the hot water. Let cool briefly, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. When ready to serve, place the dishes on a baking sheet and evenly sprinkle 1 tablespoon oven-dried brown or turbinado sugar over each custard. Using a hand-held blowtorch, caramelize the sugar (see Notes).
