Prepare the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, thoroughly whisk the vinegar, mustards, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in the oil until the vinaigrette is creamy. Stir in the herbs. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Chill all the ingredients for the salad before combining. Place all the ingredients, except the anchovies, in a large salad bowl and toss with enough vinaigrette to coat. Arrange the anchovy fillets on top of the salad or mash them into a paste and blend with the vinaigrette before tossing with the salad.
