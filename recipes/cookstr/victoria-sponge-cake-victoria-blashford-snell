Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly butter two 8in (20cm) round cake pans and line the bottoms with wax paper. Beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed for 3 minutes, or until very pale and fluffy. One at a time, beat in the eggs, beating well after each addition. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Add to the butter mixture and beat on low speed until smooth. Divide the mixture equally between the cake pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 20–25 minutes, until the cakes spring back when pressed in the centers. Let cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Invert and unmold onto the rack, and peel off the wax paper. Cool completely. Place one cake layer upside down on a serving plate. Spread with the raspberry preserves. Lightly whip the cream until soft peaks form. Spread over the preserves. Top with the remaining layer, rounded side up. Sift confectioner's sugar over the top and serve immediately. Variations Banana and Dulce de Leche Cake: Omit the whipped cream and preserves. Spread the cake bottom layer with ¼ cup dulce de leche and top with 1 large banana, thinly sliced. Top with the second layer, and substitute cocoa power for the confectioner's sugar garnish.
