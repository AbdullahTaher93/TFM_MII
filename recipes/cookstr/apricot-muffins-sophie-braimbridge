Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Grease 12 muffin molds with sunflower oil. Whisk the eggs and sugar together until they double in volume or form a ribbon consistency. Add the sunflower oil, yogurt, sifted flour, bran, baking powder, baking soda, if using, chopped apricots, ginger and/or cinnamon, and half the nuts. Fold the mixture gently until just incorporated (do not beat) and spoon into the muffin molds, so that it is just level with the top. Scatter over the remaining nuts. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes until the mixture is just firm and golden brown. Allow to rest in the molds for 5 minutes. Then turn out on to a wire rack to cool, or eat right away. 2g saturated fat, 0.12g sodium
