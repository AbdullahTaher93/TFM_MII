Season the beef with the salt and pepper. Heal the oil in a large saucepan and brown the beef. Remove beef and set aside. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pan. Add the onion and sauté until translucent and fragrant. Return the beef to the pan and add the tomato puree, beef stock, vinegar, jalapeños (if using), and spices and simmer for 30 minutes. Adjust the seasoning, adding more salt and pepper, if needed. Add the beans and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve in mugs or bowls with cheese and sour cream on top.
