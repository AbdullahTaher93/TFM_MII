To make the horseradish sauce, combine the sour cream, horseradish, scallion, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour for the flavors to blend. (The sauce can be prepared up to 1 day ahead, covered and refrigerated. Serve at room temperature.) Makes about 1 cup. Melt enough vegetable shortening in a metal fondue pot to come halfway up the sides. Heat on the kitchen stove over high heat until a deep-frying thermometer reads 375Â°F. Transfer the pot to a fondue burner with a high flame. Allow guests to cook their meat to their own taste. Serve with the horseradish sauce, along with any additional sauces.
