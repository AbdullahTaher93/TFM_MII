Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Spray an ovenproof 8-inch nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Put cold water in a saucepan to about a depth of 2 inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli, reduce the heat to a simmer, and blanch for 1 minute. Drain and set aside to cool. Cut into slices. In a small bowl, toss the broccoli with the tofu, tomato, and chives. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites until frothy. Lift the vegetables from the bowl with a slotted spoon to drain. Add to the eggs and mix gently. Pour into the pan and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until set and lightly golden. Serve plain or stuffed into the pita pocket, if desired.
