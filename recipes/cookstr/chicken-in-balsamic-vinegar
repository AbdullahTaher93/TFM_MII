Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Using a flat meat pounder, lightly pound the chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to an even thickness. Place the chicken in a lightly oiled shallow roasting pan. Season with salt and pepper, then pour the wine over the chicken. Cover with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside of the pan. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is opaque when pierced with a knife. Uncover the chicken, reserve 2 tbsp of the pan juices, and let the chicken and pan juices cool. Whisk together the oil and vinegar in a small bowl, then whisk in the reserved pan juices. Add the raisins, basil, and lemon zest. Arrange the chicken in a nonmetallic dish. Pour the dressing over the chicken and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate, turning the chicken at least once in the dressing, for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before serving. Arrange the mixed greens on a serving platter. Thinly slice the chicken, and place on the greens. Sprinkle with the pine nuts and garnish with the lemon wedges. Serve at once.
