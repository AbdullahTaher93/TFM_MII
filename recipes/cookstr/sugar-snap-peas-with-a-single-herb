Remove the tops from the peas, and pull off the strings. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the peas, keeping the heat fairly high. Cook quickly for about 1 minute. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and the herb of your choice. Cook quickly for about 1 minute longer. Transfer to a bowl and eat as soon as possible, while they are still bright green, puffy, and hot.
