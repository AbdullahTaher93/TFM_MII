Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Season the chicken well with salt and pepper and arrange in a baking pan with a little space in between. Cook for about an hour or until the chicken is crisp and any water that may accumulate on the bottom has evaporated. While the chicken is cooking, heat the olive oil in a small saucepan and sprinkle on the diced onion. Stir-fry until the onion is golden. Add the cider vinegar, lemon juice, brown sugar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, chili powder, cayenne pepper, water, and hot sauce to taste. Bring to a boil and then simmer, uncovered, for a few minutes, until slightly thickened. When the chicken is cooked, drain any fat. Spoon the barbecue sauce on the chicken. Either finish the chicken under the broiler or finish on the grill until the sauce has slightly blackened and becomes caramelized on the chicken. Serve any extra sauce on the side.
