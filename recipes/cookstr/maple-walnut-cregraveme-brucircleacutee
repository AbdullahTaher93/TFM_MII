Reserve 12 walnut halves for the topping and chop the remainder. Preheat the oven to 275Â°F. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until pale in color. Whisk in the maple syrup and cream. Place six standard-size flan dishes in a baking pan. Divide the custard mixture among the dishes. Sprinkle with the chopped walnuts and place 2 halves in the center of each dish. Pour warm water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the center of each custard still jiggles slightly. Remove from the oven and lift the dishes from the hot water. Let cool briefly, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. When ready to serve, place the dishes on a baking sheet. Evenly sprinkle 1 tablespoon maple sugar over each custard. Using a hand-held blowtorch, caramelize the sugar (see Notes).
