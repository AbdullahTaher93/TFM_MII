In a large skillet, melt the butter over high heat. Add the zucchini and squash and the stock, cover, and cook until the zucchini is tender and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the herbs, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately. Variations: For a pasta entree, toss with 1 pound cooked pappardelle or fettuccine. Substitute any of your favorite fresh herbs.
