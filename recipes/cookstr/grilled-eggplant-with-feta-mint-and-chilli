Preheat a grill, stovetop griddle or broiler to a high heat. Brush both sides of the eggplant slices with the oil, and cook them for about 2 minutes each side until golden and tender. Crumble the feta into a bowl and stir in the chilli, mint and lemon juice and grind in some black pepper. You donâ€™t need salt, as the feta is salty enough. Pile the end third of each warm eggplant slice with a heaping teaspoon of the feta mixture and roll each slice up as you go to form a soft, stuffed bundle. Place seam-side down on a plate, and sprinkle with a little more mint.
