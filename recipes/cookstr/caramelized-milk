In a heavy 4-quart saucepan, mix together the milk, sugar, vanilla bean (if using), and baking soda and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking. As it begins to thicken, stir constantly and cook until caramel-colored and very thick; this will take about 1 hour. If using vanilla extract, add it at this point. Transfer to a jar and store in the refrigerator for up to a few weeks. Variation: Here’s how Borden, one manufacturer of sweetened, condensed milk, suggests making dulce de leche: Pour one 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk into a pie plate. Cover with aluminum foil, place in a shallow pan of hot water, and bake in a preheated 425°F oven until thick and caramel-colored, about 1 hour. Remove the foil and let cool. Refrigerate before using: Makes about 1 cup.
