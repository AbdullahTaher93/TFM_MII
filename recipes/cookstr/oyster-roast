Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Line a platter with a folded napkin and set aside. Scrub the oysters well in cold water. Lay them on a baking sheet and place in the hot oven for about 10 minutes, or until they just begin to open. Meanwhile, prepare the bacon and put the butter in a bowl. Using a dry towel to hold the hot oysters, use the blunt edge of a knife to pry the oyster shells open and remove the top shell. Pour off the oyster liquor into the butter. Serve the oysters in their bottom shells, topped with a piece of bacon, on the platter. Serve with the warm liquor-enriched butter and lemon wedges.
