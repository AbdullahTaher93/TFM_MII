Prepare the souffle base and set it aside. Drop the tomatoes into boiling water for a count of ten; then peel, seed, and chop the tomatoes into pieces no larger than Â½-inch square. Heat the oil in a wide pan, add the tomatoes, and cook them briskly over high heat to evaporate the juices, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes. If the tomatoes are especially tart, add a pinch or two of sugar while they are cooking. Remove them from the heat and season to taste with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and balsamic vinegar. Set aside to cool. To construct the roulade, first thin the cream cheese with enough milk to make it soft and pliable. Then carefully spread it over the entire surface of the souffle. Cover with the scallions and chopped herbs and lastly the cooked tomatoes. Roll the souffle tightly, starting at a short end. If it is not to be served right away, wrap it well in plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. Remove 20 minutes before serving to take off the chill and bring it to room temperature. Slice thinly and serve. Leftovers will keep, wrapped, in the refrigerator for one or two days. For wine, serve a light crisp vin gris or a chilled Beaujolais.
