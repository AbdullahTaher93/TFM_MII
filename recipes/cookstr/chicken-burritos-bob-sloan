Preheat the oven to 275°F. Wrap the tortillas well in aluminum foil and place them in the oven. Put a large frying pan on high heat and let it get very hot, about 1 minute. Add the oil and chicken strips and sauté until the chicken is opaque and just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, bouillon cube, and taco seasoning. Cook 2 minutes more, stirring often, until the sauce thickens. Be sure to break up the bouillon cube so it dissolves completely. Turn off the heat and cover the pan. Cut the tomatoes lengthwise into quarters. Cut each quarter into ¼-inch slices and chop the slices roughly. Coarsely chop the onion. S. Cut the lettuce into ¼-inch slices. Stack these and then cut them in half. Put the chopped tomato, shredded lettuce, chopped onion, and grated cheese in separate bowls. Remove the tortillas from the oven. Open the package and place 2 tortillas on each dinner plate. Spoon 3 tablespoons of the chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Top the chicken with about 2 tablespoons each of grated cheese, chopped tomato and onion, and shredded lettuce. Fold the bottom third of each tortilla over the filling. Fold the top third down so it overlaps slightly. Turn each burrito so the folded side faces down on the plate. Top each with taco sauce, if desired, just before serving.
