Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, heat the butter and the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, or until it becomes translucent. Add the mushrooms, cooking them until they give off their juices and then reabsorb them, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep the mushrooms warm on the stovetop. Add the beans to the boiling water and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until slightly tender (haricots verts will take less time than green beans). Drain. Transfer about half of the mushrooms to a small dish and keep warm. Add the beans to the mushrooms in the skillet and stir to combine. Mound the beans and mushrooms gently on a serving platter and top with the reserved mushrooms. Season again with salt and pepper.
