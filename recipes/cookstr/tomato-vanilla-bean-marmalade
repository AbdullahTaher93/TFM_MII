Cut the stem end off the tomatoes and remove any tough cores. Scoop out half the seeds with your finger (a few left are fine). Place the tomatoes in a colander over a bowl and roughly smash them into 1-inch chunks with your hands. Discard any skins that slip off while you work. Reserve the tomato water for another use. Place the strained tomatoes, sugar, vanilla bean and scrapings, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to retain a low boil, and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid has evaporated and the marmalade is glossy, 25 to 35 minutes, depending on the juiciness of the tomatoes. (The jam will thicken more as it cools.) Cool and refrigerate for up to 1 month.
