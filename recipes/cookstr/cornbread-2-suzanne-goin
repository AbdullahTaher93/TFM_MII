Preheat the oven to 400°F. Heat a 10-inch cast-iron pan over medium heat for 1 minute. Add 8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter and cook 4 to 5 minutes, swirling the pan often, until the butter browns and smells nutty. Turn off the heat. Combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and honey in another bowl. Pour the liquid into the well, and whisk until just combined. (Don’t overwork the batter.) Fold in the brown butter. Return the cast-iron pan to the stove over medium-high heat. Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and when it foams pour the batter into the pan. Transfer the pan immediately to the oven, and bake 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown and set.
