Preheat grill or broiler In a small bowl, stir together the mustards, olive oil, thyme, rosemary and black pepper until smooth. Generously brush both sides of the chops with this mixture and let rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Grill or broil lamb chops to your preference (3 to 4 minutes each side for medium rare). Sprinkle salt and lemon juice on the chops. Serve immediately, garnished with chopped parsley and green onions.
