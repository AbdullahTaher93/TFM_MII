Place the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the lamb and brown well on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. To avoid crowding, you may need to do this in batches, adding only enough lamb to cover the bottom of the pan, then removing it and browning more. Set all of the browned lamb aside. Add the onions and garlic to the saucepan and cook, stirring, until they begin to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the broth and let it come to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen the cooked bits. Add the reserved lamb, white beans, carrots, rosemary, and bay leaf. Cover the pan and reduce the heat as needed to let the stew simmer until the meat is cooked through and tender, about 1 hour. Season the stew with salt and pepper to taste and remove and discard the bay leaf before serving. 3. Season the stew with salt and pepper to taste and remove and discard the bay leaf before serving.
