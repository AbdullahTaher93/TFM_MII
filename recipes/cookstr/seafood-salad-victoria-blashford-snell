To make the dressing, whisk all the ingredients together in a bowl. Heat the oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the scallops and cook, turning once, for about 2 minutes, or until opaque. Transfer to a bowl. Add the shrimp to the pan and cook about 3 minutes, or they turn pink. Transfer to the bowl. Add the salmon and cook, turning gently to avoid breaking up the fish too much, about 3 minutes, or until opaque. Add to the bowl. Cool and refrigerate at least 1 hour, until chilled. Add half of the dressing to the seafood and toss gently. Spread the watercress and cucumber on a large serving platter and drizzle with the remaining dressing. Arrange the seafood on top and serve.
