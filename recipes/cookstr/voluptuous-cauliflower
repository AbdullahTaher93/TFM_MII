Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place about half an inch of water in a pot fitted with a steaming basket, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the cauliflower and steam until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes (or steam in the microwave). In a heavy medium-size saucepan over low heat, combine the butter, cream, and 1 cup of the Gruyère. Heat until bubbling. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the cauliflower and heat 2 minutes. Spread the cauliflower in a shallow 2-quart baking dish and sprinkle with the remaining Gruyere. Season with salt and pepper. Dot with mascarpone and sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes. Increase heat to broil, or remove to a separate broiler. Broil about 6 inches from the heating element until the surface is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
