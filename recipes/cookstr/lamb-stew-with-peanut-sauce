Warm the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the lamb, in batches if necessary, and brown quickly on all sides, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to the slow cooker. Add the garlic to the pan and sauté for 1 minute, then add the peanut butter, soy sauce, sugar, lemon juice, molasses, and cayenne pepper, scraping up the brown bits and stirring with a whisk. Add the water to the pan, stir, and pour the mixture over the lamb in the crock. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 8 hours. At the end of the cooking time, stir in the peanuts and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
