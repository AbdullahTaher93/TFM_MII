Combine all the ingredients except the egg, salt, and pepper. Mash the egg yolk until smooth, adding a little of the sauce to thin it. Finely chop the white. Stir the yolk and the white back into the sauce, season with salt and pepper, and adjust the amount of vinegar if needed. If youâ€™re planning to serve the sauce later, wait to add the vinegar or lemon juice so that the green will remain bright.
