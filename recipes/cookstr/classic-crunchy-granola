1 Preheat the oven to 275Â° F. Lightly oil one or two baking sheets. 2 Combine oats, wheat germ, sesame seeds, and almonds in a large mixing bowl. 3 Combine the honey with the oil in a small container. Drizzle into the oat mixture, stirring constantly; mix thoroughly until evenly coated. 4 Spread on the baking sheets. Bake, stirring every 10 minutes or so, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden. 5 Allow the granola to cool on the baking sheets, then stir in the raisins. When completely cool, transfer to jars and store at room temperature. Keeps 1 to 2 months in a cool, dry place.
