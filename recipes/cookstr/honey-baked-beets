Place beets in a deep microwave-safe dish, such as a pie plate, and add a small amount of water. Cover with microwave-safe plastic wrap and microwave on High for 15 to 18 minutes, or until tender, turning halfway through. Let cool for several minutes. Remove wrap, cut ends off beets, peel and quarter. Combine honey and lemon juice; add to beets and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
