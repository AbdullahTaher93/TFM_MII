STEP 1: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Have ready an 8-inch square glass baking dish. STEP 2: Toss together the strawberries, 1 cup of the bread crumbs, ½ cup of the confectioners’ sugar, the zest, and salt in a large bowl. Transfer to the baking dish. Toss the remaining 1½ cups bread crumbs with the hazelnuts, butter, and granulated sugar in a medium bowl, and sprinkle evenly over the berries. STEP 3: Bake for 40 minutes, until the berries are bubbling and the topping is browned. Let cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes. STEP 4: Just before serving, beat the cream with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large deep bowl just until it begins to thicken. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar and the vanilla and beat just until the cream forms soft peaks when the beaters are lifted. STEP 5: Serve the crisp warm with the cream.
