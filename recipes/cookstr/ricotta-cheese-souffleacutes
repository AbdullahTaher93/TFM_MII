Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Generously butter 6 ramekins or custard dishes, each one about ½-cup capacity. Set aside. Mix together the ricotta cheese, mustard, oregano, cayenne, Parmesan, milk and 3 egg yolks in a bowl until well blended. In a clean bowl, with clean beaters, whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff. (Do not overdo this step or your soufflé will be dry.) Fold the egg whites into the cheese batter. Work fast so that you do not deflate the egg whites. Spoon some of the batter into each ramekin. Place them in a baking pan filled with enough hot water to come three-quarters of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 15 minutes. Serve the soufflés from the molds; their centers should be soft.
