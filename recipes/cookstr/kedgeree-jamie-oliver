Boil the eggs for 10 minutes. Hold under cold running water. Put the fish and bay leaves in a shallow pan with enough water to cover. Bring to the boil, cover, and simmer for about 5 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside. When cool enough to handle, remove the skin from the fish, flake it into chunks and set aside. Cook the rice in salted water for about 10 minutes and drain. Refresh in cold water, drain again, and leave in the fridge until needed. Melt the butter in a pan over a low heat. Add the ginger, onions and garlic. Soften for about 5 minutes, then add the curry powder and mustard seeds. Cook for a further few minutes, then add the chopped tomatoes and lemon juice. Quarter the eggs. Add the fish and rice to the pan and gently heat through. Add the eggs, half of your chopped coriander and chilli and stir gently. Place in a warm serving dish. Mix your remaining coriander and yogurt together, and serve with the kedgeree.
