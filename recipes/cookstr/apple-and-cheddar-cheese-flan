Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) Almond Pie Crust: In a food processor or blender, combine almonds and cookies. Process for 20 seconds or until medium-fine. In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Remove from heat, stir in almond mixture and sugar. Press crumb crust into pan. Chill until ready to fill. Filling: Peel, core and slice 5 of the apples. In a large bowl, mix sour cream and cottage cheese together. Beat in egg. Add sliced apples, cheddar cheese, sugar, and sweet cicely and stir well. Spoon cheese mixture over Almond Pie Crust, spreading to level the top. Core and thinly slice remaining apple, leaving the peel on. Arrange over top of filling. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour or until crust is lightly brown and apples are tender. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Variation: For a savory twist, add 1 tbsp (15 mL) finely chopped onion in Step 2.
