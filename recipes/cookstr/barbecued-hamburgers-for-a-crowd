Combine all the ingredients in a very large mixing bowl, except the oil and barbecue sauce, and mix well. Form into patties. Brush with the oil. Broil, fry, or grill to desired doneness. More oil can be brushed on the patties while they cook. Right before taking the patties off the grill, brush them liberally with the barbecue sauce.
