In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, buttermilk, lime juice, 1/2 tablespoon of the red onion, and adobo sauce. Cover and chill. In another bowl, mix the corn and cilantro with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon onion. Arrange the lettuce to cover the bottom of a large salad platter. Arrange the corn mixture, crab, avocado, tomato, and bacon in rows on top of the lettuce. Sprinkle with the eggs and drizzle with the chipotle dressing.
