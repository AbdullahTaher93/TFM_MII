Use a 4-quart slow cooker. Put the meat in a plastic ziplock bag with the ginger, mustard, salt, pepper, and cornstarch. Shake to coat. Pour the contents into your stoneware. Add the cranberries, sugars, raisins, and garlic. Pour in cranberry juice, and top with the lemon slices. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours, or high for about 4 hours. Serve with rice or pasta.
