Place the quinoa in a medium saucepan and cover with 2 cups cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat so that the mixture simmers. Cover and cook until the water has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the salt and pepper, and set aside. Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes, and then add the bell pepper. Continue cooking until the bell pepper has softened, about 3 minutes. Add the olives, stirring well to combine, and cook for 1 minute more. Stir the sautéed vegetables into the quinoa. Add the lemon juice, the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the cumin, and cilantro. Toss well to combine. Serve the quinoa warm, at room temperature, or cold.
