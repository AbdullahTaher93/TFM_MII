Sift the flour into a bowl and add the salt. Then add the butter and cut it into pieces with a knife. Add the yolk. Keep cutting the butter into the flour until the mixture is about the size of peas. Rub these pieces between your thumbs and fingertips. When the fat has the texture of cornflakes, stop rubbing. (The mixture shouldn't look like fine breadcrumbs, which makes the pastry dense rather than the flaky crust it should be.) Add just enough of the water to combine the mixture (but not too much or it will be too sticky and elastic) and, with your hands, mix it in until the dough starts to bind together. Quickly work the mixture into a ball and wrap it in plastic or wax paper. Let it rest in the refrigerator several hours or overnight. Roll out the dough into a round, about 1/8 inch thick and 2 inches larger than the pan, and trim off the excess dough.
