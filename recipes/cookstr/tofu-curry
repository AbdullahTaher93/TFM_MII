In a food processor, process the onion, ginger root, garlic, tomato, and chiles to a smooth, slightly watery paste. Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Add the yogurt, salt, garam masala, fenugreek leaves, and red chile powder. Mix well. In a deep, heavy pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the asafetida, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Cook for 30 seconds, until the seeds sizzle. Add the soy yogurt mixture and the water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly. (This step is key. The spices need to cook and blend evenly into the other ingredients.) Add the tofu. Simmer for another 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the whole spices, garnish with the fresh cilantro, and serve immediately over a bed of brown or white basmati rice.
