Celery root has a very tough peel and discolors easily, so work quickly. Use a sharp sturdy paring knife to cut away the peel. Rub the white flesh with a little of the lemon juice. Cut the celery root into chunks that will fit into the tube of a food processor fitted with the shredding blade. (You can also shred the celery root with a mandoline.) Shred the celery root, then toss in a large bowl with the remaining lemon juice and salt and cover tightly. Cut the apple into julienne with a sharp knife or mandoline. Toss with the shredded celery root and cover. Prepare the dressing: In a warm medium bowl, whisk the vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in the oil until emulsified. Whisk in the mayonnaise. Season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. Fold the dressing into the celery-root mixture and taste for seasoning, Cover and refrigerate until well-chilled. (The salad will keep for several days if kept covered and refrigerated.) When ready to serve, sprinkle with the parsley.
