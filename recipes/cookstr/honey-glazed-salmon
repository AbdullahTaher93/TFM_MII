Place the salmon fillets in a microwave safe dish. In a bowl, mix the mustard, honey, thyme, and season to taste. Spread the mixture evenly over the salmon fillets. Sprinkle with a little lime juice and cover with a microwaveable top or loosely with plastic wrap. Microwave on high for 3 to 4 minutes. Time may vary based on the thickness of your fillets. Remove from the microwave and let stand for 2 minutes before serving.
