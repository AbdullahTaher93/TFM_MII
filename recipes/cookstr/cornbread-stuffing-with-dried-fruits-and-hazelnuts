The day before making the stuffing, bake and cool the cornbreads. Crumble them onto a large baking sheet. Let stand overnight, uncovered, to dry and stale. Combine the dried fruit and enough warm water to cover in a medium bowl. Let stand until softened, about 1 hour. Drain well. Cut the fruit into bite-size pieces. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and celery and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the cornbread, drained fruit, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and celery seed. Stir in enough of the stock to thoroughly moisten the stuffing, about 1Â½ cups. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Beat the eggs, if using, in a small bowl and stir into the stuffing. Stir in the hazelnuts. Use immediately as a turkey stuffing.
