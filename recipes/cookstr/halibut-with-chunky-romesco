Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Brush the bottom of a 13 × 9in (33 × 23cm) baking dish with 1 tbsp of the oil. Add the fish, skinned side down. Season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large, heavy frying pan over medium heat. Add the bread crumbs, almonds, and garlic and cook, stirring often, until golden. Stir in the parsley. Spoon the mixture over the fish. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake 5 minutes more, until the fish is opaque when pierced with a knife. Meanwhile, to make the romesco sauce, pulse the red peppers, oil, vinegar, cayenne, and paprika in a food processor. Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl. Remove the fish from the oven and drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil. Serve hot, topped with the romesco sauce.
