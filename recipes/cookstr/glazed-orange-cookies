Preheat oven to 400 degrees Prepare 2 cookie sheets. Beat the butter with the sugar until light and creamy. Beat the egg, orange rind and juice into the butter. Sift the flour again with the baking powder and salt and fold into the butter mixture. Chill the dough for at least 2 hours. Lightly flour a pastry board or work surface and roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/8-inch. Stamp out 2-inch round cookies with a cutter or an inverted glass. Gather any scraps of dough into a ball, refrigerate it and roll out again after it has had time to chill. Transfer the cookies to prepared sheets and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a cookie rack. When the cookies are completely cool, glaze them by combining confectionersâ€™ sugar with the orange liqueur and rind and spreading this on the cookies. Let the glaze dry before storing the cookies in an airtight tin.
