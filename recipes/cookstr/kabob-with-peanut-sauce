Pour the marinade on top and toss to coat evenly. Cover and marinate for 1 hour at room temperature or 2 to 4 hours in the refrigerator, turning the meat occasionally. Preheat the broiler or prepare a fire in the charcoal grill. Thread the poultry cubes onto a bamboo skewer that has been soaked in water for 15 minutes or onto a metal skewer. Brush with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Slip under the broiler or place on the grill and cook, turning once, for 3 minutes on each side for chicken, lamb, or beef and 4 to 5 minutes on each side for pork. The kabob should be nicely browned but still juicy. Serve with the Peanut Sauce.
