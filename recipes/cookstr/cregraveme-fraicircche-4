In a large bowl, stir the cream and buttermilk together. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the mixture stand at room temperature for 36 hours, or until it has thickened. Then refrigerate tor at least 24 hours and up to 10 days before using. The crème fraîche will continue to thicken in the refrigerator.
