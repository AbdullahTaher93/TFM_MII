Place the tomatoes in a food processor and puree, them, skins and all. Add the garlic, basil, 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper to taste and pulse to combine. Place in a large skillet over low heat and cook, covered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and pulpy. Meanwhile, wash and scrub the potatoes very well and pat dry. Using a sharp potato peeler, peel off the skin in spirals. Place the skins in a bowl filled with ice water for 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and blot dry on paper towels. Save the potatoes for another use. Fill another heavy skillet with olive oil to reach a ½ inch up the sides. Heat the oil over high heat to 375°F. To test, drop a small piece of the potato skin into the hot oil; if it sizzles, the oil is ready. Carefully break the eggs into the tomato sauce. Cook over low heat until the eggs set in the sauce, about 7 to 8 minutes. While the eggs cook, place the potato skins in the hot oil and fry them; it won’t take more than a minute or so. Remove, drain the skins on paper towels, and place in a bowl. Sprinkle with kosher salt to taste, oregano, and grated cheese. Using a large spoon, carefully remove the eggs from the skillet and place on 2 serving plates. Divide the potato skins between the two plates and serve, with the sauce spooned on top.
