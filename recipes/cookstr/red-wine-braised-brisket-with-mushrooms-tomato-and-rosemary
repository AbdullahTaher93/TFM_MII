Preheat the oven to 300°F. Put the olive oil in a roasting pan or a large, ovenproof sauté pan and place over high heat. Season the brisket generously with salt and pepper. When the oil is hot, gently sear the meat on all sides until good and golden brown.Remove meat from the pan and set aside on a serving platter. Add the garlic, onion, carrot, and celery to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, still on high heat. Add the rosemary and a bit more salt and pepper. Add the butter and cook until melted. Lower the heat to medium and sprinkle in the flour. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the red wine, raise the heat to high, and cook for 2 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan so the ingredients do not stick. Add the tomatoes, crushing them a bit with your hands—yes, your hands—as you put them into the pan. Add the chicken stock and the quartered button mushrooms, and stir everything around in the pan. Add porcini mushrooms (sliced, if the pieces are very large) along with their soaking liquid. Return the brisket to the pan and cover with the lid or aluminium foil. Place in the oven and braise gently for 2 to 3 hours, checking occasionally to make sure the liquid is not boiling. The meat should be very tender, almost “falling off the bone,” and the sauce will have thickened slightly. Turn off the heat, but leave the pan undisturbed inside the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the meat to a cutting board, slice across the grain into thin slices, and arrange on a serving platter. Garnish with the sauce and vegetables from the pan and serve.
