With the side of a cleaver or large knife, gently smack the green olives to crack them; donâ€™t pound too hard or you will smash them. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the bay leaves, oregano, and fennel seed. Break the chile pepper in half and sprinkle some or all of the seeds into the skillet; add the chile pods to the skillet. Cook the seasonings briefly to release their fragrance, then add the olives. Cook, stirring, until the olives are hot throughout, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let stand until they are just warm. Trim the cheese of any rind and cut into thin slices or small cubes. Place the cheese on one end of a serving platter and spoon the olives, with their seasonings, alongside.
