In a blender or food processor, puree 1 large tomato, roasted peppers, cilantro, and 1 cup of water. Set aside. Sprinkle the chicken generously with salt and black pepper. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stockpot. Add half the chicken and sauté on both sides, flipping once, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a bowl and repeat with the remaining chicken. Set aside. Add the onion to the pot and sauté until just beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the cumin and oregano, stir for 30 seconds, then add the puréed tomato-pepper mixture, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining chopped tomatoes, garlic, salt, and black pepper. Return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the pot (push the chicken down into the sauce so it is well covered). Cover the pot and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Add the greens and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt and black pepper to taste. To serve, place one chicken thigh in each serving dish with rice, if desired. Spoon the chile verde sauce over the chicken and serve with the green tomato salsa, sour cream, and reserved cilantro leaves.
