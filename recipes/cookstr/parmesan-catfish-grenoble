Season fish fillets with salt and white pepper. In a shallow bowl, combine cheese, paprika, and parsley. Dredge each fillet in flour, then into the beaten eggs, then into the cheese mixture, pressing firmly to make sure the fish is totally covered and as dry as possible. Heat butter over medium flame and fry fillets until golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Drain filets on paper towels and either serve immediately or hold in a warm oven until service In a small bowl, combine lemon, tomatoes, capers, onions, scallions, and about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Just before service, heat this mixture on very high heat for just a moment so that the ingredients get hot, but are not cooked. Spoon mixture over fish fillets and garnish with reserved lemon zest.
