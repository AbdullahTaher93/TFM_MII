In a medium saucepan, combine the cream and granulated sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a gentle simmer. Cook for 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime zest. Gradually stir in the lime juice. Place six standard-size flan dishes in a baking pan. Divide the custard mixture among the dishes. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days. When ready to serve, place the dishes on a baking sheet and evenly sprinkle 1 tablespoon brown or confectioners’ sugar over each custard. (If using confectioners’ sugar, use a small sieve to sprinkle the sugar.) Using a hand-held blowtorch, caramelize the sugar (see Notes).
