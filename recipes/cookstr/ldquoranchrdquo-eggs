Have warm 4 small gratin dishes for individual portions. Heat enough oil in a small frying pan to cover the surface by about Â¼-inch (6.25 mm). Fry the tortillas for about 2 seconds on each side; they should be well heated through but not crisp. Remove and drain on paper toweling, then put onto warmed plates. Fry the eggs one by one, adding oil as necessary, and place on top of the tortillas. Pour approximately 1/3 cup (85 ml) of the sauce over each egg, decorate with the chile strips, and sprinkle with cheese. Serve immediately.
