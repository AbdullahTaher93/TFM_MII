Preheat the oven to 400°. Prepare the pie dough and chill it. In a mixing bowl, mix the blueberries with the sugar and tapioca. Line a 9-inch pan with enough lemon slices to cover the bottom. Fill the pan with the blueberry mixture. On a floured surface, roll out the pie dough ¼ – inch thick. Cover the berries with the dough. Trim and crimp the edges. Bake in the center of the oven 35 minutes, or until golden. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or the rose hip variation.
