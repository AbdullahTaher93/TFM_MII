For the Veggie Filling: Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the leek and cook until it begins to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the cabbage, garlic, and vinegar and cook, stirring, until the cabbage is soft, about 4 minutes more. Remove from the heat and stir in the carrot, ginger, and soy sauce. Allow the filling to cool. For the Pork Filling: Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and work together until fully incorporated. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. For the Dipping Sauce: Stir all the ingredients together in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Makes about 1/3 cup To make the potstickers: Lay a wonton wrapperon the work surface and put a heaping teaspoon of filling in the center. Dip your finger in a little water and wet the edges of the wonton wrapper. Pinch the edges together to form four right angles. To cook the potstickers, heat the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Place all of the potstickers upright into the pan and cook, without disturbing them, until browned on the bottom, just a couple of minutes. Add the water to the pan and immediately cover. Allow the potstickers to steam for about 3 minutes, then remove the skillet lid. Continue cooking until the water has nearly evaporated. Transfer the dumplings to a platter and serve with the dipping sauce.
