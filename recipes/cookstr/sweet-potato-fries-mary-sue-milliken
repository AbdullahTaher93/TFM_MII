Pour vegetable oil to a depth of 4 to 5 inches into a large heavy saucepan or deep-fat fryer. Heat to 360Â°F. Fry the potatoes, a handful at a time, until cooked through and just lightly colored, 2 to 3 minutes. (The key to consistently good fries is to keep the oil hot. Wait for the oil to reheat between batches.) Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and serve hot.
