In a large mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, salt, and sugar. Lightly mix with 4 cups of the boiling water. If the consistency is dry and lumpy, immediately add ½ to 1 cup of cold water. Add the eggs and mix. Heat 1½ inches of oil in a large heavy skillet. When the oil is very hot, dip your fingers into a bowl of cold water. Take about ¼ cup of the cornmeal mixture and pat it between your fingers into 3-inch long ovals. (You should see the imprint of your fingers). Immediately slip the batter into the hot oil, dipping your hands in the cold water and making more. Turn the corn bread when golden and continue to cook the other side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
