In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt and cut in the lard until the mixture is crumbly. In a small bowl, combine the yeast, lukewarm water, and sugar. Set aside until the yeast and sugar dissolve and the mixture is foamy. Mix the dissolved yeast mixture wit the flour and lard. Knead the dough until it becomes elastic and pliable, about 7 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl. Cover the bowl and place it in a warm, draft-free place to rise until doubled, about 4 hours. Punch down the dough and divide in half. Shape the dough into 2 free form loaves and place them on an ungreased baking sheet, or place each loaf in a medium-size bread pan. Cover the loaves and let rise again in a warm, draft free place for another 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Bake the loaves for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the bottom of each loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
