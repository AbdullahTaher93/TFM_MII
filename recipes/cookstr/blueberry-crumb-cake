Set a rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. For the cake batter, combine the butter and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until lightened, about 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla and lemon zest, then beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating smooth after each addition. Quickly stir the flour and baking powder together, decrease the speed to low, and beat in half the flour mixture. Beat in the buttermilk until it is absorbed, stop the mixer, and use a large rubber spatula to scrape down the bowl and beater. Beat in the remaining flour mixture. Use a large rubber spatula to give the batter a final mixing. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and use a metal offset spatula to spread it evenly. Top the batter with the blueberries, gently pressing them in. For the crumbs, stir the butter and brown sugar together in a bowl. Quickly mix the flour, cinnamon, and baking powder together and use a rubber spatula to stir them into the butter mixture. Use your fingertips to break up the mixture into small crumbs. Evenly scatter the crumbs on the blueberries. Bake the cake for about 55 minutes, or until it is well risen, the crumbs are a deep golden color, and a toothpick inserted in the center emerges clean. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes. Invert the cake to a large plate and remove the pan and paper. Replace the pan with a cooling rack and reinvert. Lift off the plate and cool the cake completely. SERVING: This is particularly good for brunch or tea. Or serve it as dessert following a very light meal.
