Place the onion, garlic, ginger, cardamom seeds, red chilies, peppercorns, green chilies, salt, brown sugar, vinegar, yogurt, cumin seeds, and coriander seeds in a blender and blend for 5 to 7 minutes into a smooth but slightly grainy texture. Make gashes into the leg of lamb (if on the bone) and smear the mixture on the meat and marinate overnight. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Cover the meat with foil and roast for 3 hours. Remove the foil and and cook for another hour, turning 2 to 3 times. The meat should be crisp and brown outside and tender inside. Cool slightly and then slice and serve.
