Chop the onion. Chop the tomatoes. Juice the lemon. Heat the olive oil in deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken an cook about 2 minutes on each side. Add all of the remaining ingredients, except the couscous, to the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. About 10 minutes before the chicken is done simmering, prepare the couscous. Bring the water and oil to boil in a small pot. Add the couscous, stir quickly, and cover. Remove from the heat and let sit about 5 minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork before spooning some onto a plate and topping with the chicken mixture.
