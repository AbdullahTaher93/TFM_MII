In a food processor, grind the almonds to a fine meal. Add the pineapple, dates, apricots, and cinnamon to the food processor and process until well combined. Pour in the coconut oil and vanilla extract and process the mixture for a few seconds. Add the lemon juice. Taste the mixture and add more fruit, spice, or oil if necessary. The consistency should be a bit chunky and should hold together when formed. Form the dough into small or large balls, and roll them in the shredded coconut to coat. Place the balls on a plate to chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before you enjoy them.
