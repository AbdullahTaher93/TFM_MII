Place the onions in a large bowl, cover with cold water, and allow to soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water, drain again, and pat dry. Place the garlic and jalape√±os on a cutting board. Sprinkle with the coarse salt and chop as fine as possible, mashing the mixture into a paste with the side of a large sharp knife. Place the paste in a bowl and add the cilantro, oregano, coriander, cayenne, olive oil, and vinegar. Stir well. Add the onions and toss to combine. Adjust the seasonings to taste. Serve within 2 to 3 hours.
