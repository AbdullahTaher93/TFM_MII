Make the candied kumquats and syrup: Slice off the ends of each kumquat, 1/16 inch round sliver. Slice the remaining fruit into 3 to 5 slices depending on its size. Combine the sliced kumquats, sugar, 1/3 cup water, and corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring the pan to a boil over medium-high heat. Immediately turn down the heat and slowly simmer until the kumquats become somewhat translucent, 6 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool in the syrup. These kumquats in their syrup keep, in a sealed container and refrigerated, for several weeks. Make the candied Meyer lemon zest and syrup: Using a peeler with a square head, remove the zest of the lemons in long, even strokes. Slice the zest into long thin strips to make ½ cup of julienned Meyer lemon zest (½ inch long × 1/16 inch thick). In a small saucepan, combine the zest and 2 cups cold water and bring to a boil. Strain out the zest and discard the water. Repeat this process 3 more times. Combine the blanched zest, sugar, 1/3 cup water, and corn syrup in the saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer the lemon peel for about 30 minutes. This candied peel in its syrup will keep, in a sealed container and refrigerated, for several weeks.
