Heat the chicken stock in a saucepan. In a frying pan, cook the strips of chicken without any oil until they have lost their rawness, giving them a stir frequently, and then add the soy sauce to the hot pan of chicken, letting it boil gently a little before tipping the contents of the skillet into the saucepan of hot stock. Bring the pan to the boil and add the baby corn, noodles, sugar-snaps and fine beans cut in half. Let the pan come back up to boiling point and cook for a minute or so, so that the noodles are warmed through and the vegetables tender but still crisp.
