Heat the oven to 400°F. Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a plate and set aside to cool. Increase the oven temperature to 425°F. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and prepare a bowl of ice water. Cook the peas in the boiling water until very tender but still bright green, 2 to 6 minutes. Drain the peas and immediately transfer them to the ice water to stop the cooking. When they are cool, drain and dry them on a towel. In a mortar, use a pestle to pound the garlic clove with a pinch of salt to a paste. Add the peas and pound into a paste, adding a little olive oil to help if necessary. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Add the pine nuts to the mortar and pound them briefly to break them up, but do not pound them to a paste; they should still have a bit of texture. Add the nuts to the pea mixture. Coarsely chop the parsley and chervil and add them to the bowl. Stir in enough olive oil to loosen the pesta but not enough to make it runny. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside. Slice the baguette into ¼-inch slices. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet, and toast in the hot oven until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool slightly. Spread about ½ teaspoon of the goat cheese on each crostini and grind some black pepper over the cheese. Arrange the crostini on a platter and top each with about 1 teaspoon of the pestp. Drizzle with some olive oil and serve.
