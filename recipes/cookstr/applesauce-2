Combine the apples, sugar, and about Â½ cup/120 ml of water in a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the apples are broken down and very soft. Beat the apples into a puree with a fork or whisk.
