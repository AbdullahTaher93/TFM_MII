Marinate the drumsticks overnight in the soy sauce in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Drain the chicken and place in rows on a large baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, brush each drumstick with a thin coating of the sesame oil. Whisk the mustard and lemon juice together and brush generously over each drumstick. Combine the bread crumbs, ginger, and garlic and sprinkle evenly over the top and sides of each drumstick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake 1 hour, covering with aluminum foil if the drumsticks get too brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.
