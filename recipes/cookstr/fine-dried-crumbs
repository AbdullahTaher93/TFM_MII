Cut the bread into 1- to 1½-inch cubes. You do not need to remove the crust. Arrange the bread cubes on trays and let stand at room temperature until very dry. This may take a day or two in hot, dry weather or up to several days if the humidity is high. In damp weather, you may need to finish the drying in a 200°F oven for about 1 hour. Let cool completely before grinding. Working in batches, place the bread cubes in a food processor and whir until reduced to very fine crumbs. Transfer the crumbs to a large bowl. When all the bread is ground, pass the crumbs through a medium-mesh sieve, using your hand to push them through. Reprocess and resieve the crumbs that do not pass through. Discard any crumbs that don’t make it through the sieve the second time. Freeze in 1- or 2-cup freezer bags for convenience.
