Bring 4 cups of water to a boil over medium heat. Stream in the grits and whisk. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the water is absorbed but the grits still have a porridge-like consistency. Add a bit more water if needed. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm. Heat the oil and butter in a large heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and saut√© until softened (but not browned), about 2 minutes. Add the cayenne, paprika, and honey, and mix well. Add the shrimp and stir to coat. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock and continue to cook until the shrimp are no longer pink and the stock is reduced, about 10 minutes. Remove the grits from the heat and stir in the cheeses, butter, and cream. Fry the eggs over easy, until the yolks are just barely runny. Divide the grits among 4 bowls and top with the shrimp, some of the sauce, an egg, and a dash of Tabasco. Garnish the dish with a sprinkling of chives and serve immediately.
