Preheat oven to 425째 F (220째 C) Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add whole potatoes and yam; reduce heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until barely pierceable. Drain, cut into quarters and set aside. Spread oil over bottom of roasting pan. Add chicken legs, potatoes and yams, more-or-less in a single layer (a little overlapping is fine). Fit onion, garlic and green pepper in empty spots. Distribute tomatoes over everything. Stir together boiling chicken stock, lemon juice, paprika, oregano, sugar, salt and pepper. Pour one-half of mixture evenly over the chicken and vegetables (reserve the rest of the stock). Cover roasting pan. Bake undisturbed for 30 minutes. Remove pan from oven. Toss and turn vegetables and baste chicken with the juices. Return to oven and bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and reduce oven temperature to 350째 F (180째 C). Bring the remaining stock to a boil; pour over chicken and stir in. Return to the oven and let bake, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes or until the sauce is reduced and the chicken is falling off the bone. Remove from oven and let rest, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve.
