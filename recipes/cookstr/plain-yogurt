Mix the yogurt with ½ cup of the milk in a large glass or earthen bowl. Set aside. In a small saucepan, bring the remaining 3½ cups milk to a boil and allow to boil for 5 to 6 minutes (the milk will start to foam and rise up). Take immediately off the heat and allow to cool for 15 to 20 minutes, until you are able to comfortably insert a finger into the hot milk (the temperature should not feel much different from your body temperature). Pour the milk into the yogurt-milk mixture and blend well. Cover the bowl tightly and wrap in blankets to keep warm (the more blankets, the better). Let stand overnight or for 12 to 14 hours in a warm place (you want the active yogurt cultures to grow). The next morning you will have yogurt. Because you will not be adding thickeners such as cornstarch or gum stabilizers, the final product will be somewhat runnier than commercial brands. But the resulting taste has a much more sour flavor, which is more traditional. Keep refrigerated for up to 3 to 4 days.
