Preheat the oven to 400°F. with the rack on the center shelf. Whisk the eggs with the milk, sugar, salt, and vanilla. Pour the flour over the egg mixture and, using a batter whisk or, a regular whisk, combine the ingredients until no large dry pockets remain. Then give the batter a few more brisk stirs to make the mixture come together, but don’t overwork it (small lumps will still be visible). Place the butter in a 9½-inch glass pie plate or a 10-inch well-seasoned cast-iron skillet and place the dish in the preheated oven for 6 minutes, or until the butter is melted and bubbling and the pan is very hot. Pull the rack toward you so the dish is accessible. Working quickly so the oven stays hot, whisk the spice blend into the hot butter. Shut the door and let this heat for 1 minute. Open the door and pour in the pancake batter (don’t worry if it seems uneven). Shut the door and bake the pancake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the sides are very high and golden and the center is irregularly puffed. Remove from the oven and use a thin metal spatula to transfer the pancake (which will look like a giant empty pastry bowl) to a serving plate. Use a paper towel to dab off any excess melted butter in the center. Serve the pancake immediately, filled with mixed fresh berries, dusted lightly with confectioners’ sugar.
