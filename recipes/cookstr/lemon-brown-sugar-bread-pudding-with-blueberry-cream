Preheat the oven to 350°F. Put bread cubes into a large bowl. In a second large bowl, combine the eggs, cream, brown sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla and pour the mixture over the bread. Mix well and let sit for at least 15 minutes so the bread can absorb the custard mix. Butter a casserole dish and pour the bread pudding into it. Bake it in the top half of the oven until the center is slightly firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. Serve warm, topped with chilled Blueberry Cream and garnished with a few fresh blueberries and a sprinkle of confectioners’ sugar. For the Blueberry Cream: Put all the ingredients into a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. Yield: 2½ cups
