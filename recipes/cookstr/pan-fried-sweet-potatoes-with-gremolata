In a heavy skillet over medium heat, combine pancetta and oil. Cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. Toss sweet potato into pancetta. Cook, without stirring, for about 10 minutes or until sweet potato pieces are golden brown on the bottom. Using tongs, tum and cook for 6 to 10 minutes more or until tender and browned on the other side. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. In another skillet, melt butter over medium heat until bubbling. Stir in bread crumbs and cook, stirring, until golden brown and crisp (donâ€™t let them bum). Remove from heat and stir in parsley and lemon zest. Season to taste with salt (remember, the bacon may be salty) and freshly ground pepper. Scrape bread crumb mixture over sweet potato mixture and toss to combine. Serve immediately.
