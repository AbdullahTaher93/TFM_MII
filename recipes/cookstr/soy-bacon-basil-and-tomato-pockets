Cook bacon strips according to package directions. Let cool slightly. Carefully separate pitas to open pockets. Spread one-quarter of the soy mayonnaise over inside bottom of each pita half. For each pocket, top mayonnaise with one-quarter each of the basil leaves and tomato slices. Place 3 strips of bacon over tomatoes. Season with pepper to taste, if using. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Variations: Chop the basil leaves and stir into the mayonnaise, then spread over the pitas. Soy Bacon, Basil and Tomato Sandwich: If you prefer a more traditional presentation, substitute 8 slices whole wheat bread, toasted, for the pitas. Continue with Step 2.
