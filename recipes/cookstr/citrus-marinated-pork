With a mortar and pestle, grind together the orange zest, thyme, pepper, and garlic to a paste. Rub the paste into the pork. Put the pork into a dish, combine the orange juice and vinegar, and pour the mixture over the pork. Cover the meat, and refrigerate it for 2 to 8 hours. Preheat the oven to 425°. Oil a baking pan lightly. Heat the pan in the oven for 4 minutes. Set the pork in the pan, and drizzle it with 1 tablespoon honey. Roast the pork 10 minutes. Turn the pork, and spoon any exuded juices over it. Drizzle the pork with the remaining 1 tablespoon honey. Roast the pork 20 to 25 minutes longer (for medium meat), basting it once or twice with the pan juices. Remove the pork from the oven, and let it stand at room temperature 5 minutes. Cut it into ¼-inch slices, and serve it garnished with watercress and orange slices.
