To soften before use, place it in the dehydrator or in a hot water bath. (If the room is warm, simply let the chocolate oil sit at room temperature.) With a higher proportion of coconut butter/oil, this chocolate oil will harden nicely as a coating on cakes, tarts, cookies, bars, chocolates, nuts, bananas, or other fruits. Dip fresh stemmed strawberries in chocolate oil, then refrigerate for an easy fast, and sexy dessert.
