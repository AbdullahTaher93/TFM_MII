Make the sofrito. In a large cazuela or medium Dutch oven or another heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and nearly translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic, tomatoes, and 2 pinches of salt and cook, stirring from time to time, until the tomato has darkened to a deeper shade of red and the sofrito is pasty, 10 to 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400°F. When the sofrito is ready, sprinkle in the pimentón and saffron, letting the flavors meld for a few seconds while stirring constantly. Add the stock, increase the heat, and bring to a boil. Add the rice and peas. With a wooden spoon, probe the pan to make sure the rice is evenly distributed. Check for salt, adjusting the seasoning as needed. Cook, uncovered, over medium-high heat for 10 minutes, gently stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Working quickly, lay the sardines across the top of the rice like spokes on a wheel, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and place in the hot oven. Bake until most of the liquid is absorbed (it doesn’t need to be dry), the rice is al punto, with just a bite to it, and the eyes of the sardines are cloudy, about 10 minutes. Remove the cazuela from the oven and immediately transfer the food to plates, letting the rice rest for a few minutes before serving.
