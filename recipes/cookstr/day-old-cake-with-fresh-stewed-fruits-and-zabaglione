Fruit: In separate saucepans, lightly stew the berries with 2 tablespoons of sugar each, just until they begin to give off their juices. Cool and reserve. Zabaglione cream: Bring water to a simmer in the bottom of a double boiler. Off the heat, in a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they are smooth and lemon colored. Set the bowl over the simmering water and, whisking constantly, slowly add the sugar. As the eggs begin to thicken, gradually add the Marsala and continue to whisk for about 20 minutes, until the zabaglione coats the back of a spoon. If the mixture begins to curdle, remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in a little cold heavy cream. Beat vigorously. Cool the mixture over ice water. Cover with a sheet of plastic placed directly on the surface of the cream. Refrigerate. To assemble: Fold the whipped cream into the zabaglione mixture; do not overblend. Place the cubed cake onto a deep platter and smother with the berries. Allow to rest for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. Liberally sprinkle with cinnamon and cocoa and serve.
