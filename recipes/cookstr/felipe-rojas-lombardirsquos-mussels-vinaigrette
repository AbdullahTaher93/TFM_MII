Remove the beards from the mussels. (Don’t beard until right before you prepare this dish.) In a 12-inch skillet with a tight-fitting lid, combine 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, 2 tablespoons of the white wine, the thyme, and the cleaned mussels. Cover the skillet and steam the mussels over high heat until the shells are just opened, 5 to 8 minutes. Discard any mussels that have not opened, and set the rest aside. Let the liquid in the skillet sit for a few minutes so that any sand or sediment settles at the bottom. Then carefully strain this liquid through a sieve lined with cheesecloth, leaving any residue in the skillet. Pour the liquid into a large bowl, and reserve. Remove the mussels from their shells. Place the mussels in the bowl with the liquid. Add the cooked potatoes, tomatoes, onion, peas, vinegar, salt, parsley, and the remaining ½ cup olive oil and remaining white wine. Toss gently, being careful not to damage the mussels. Serve at room temperature.
