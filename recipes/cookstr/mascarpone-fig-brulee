Pulse the fig cookies in a food processor until they’re nice and crumbly. Whisk together the mascarpone cheese, fig preserves, honey, and vanilla extract. If the preserves are super sweet, you can omit the honey or, alternatively, omit the jam and just use the honey. Easy stuff. Now in a small glass, alternately layer the crushed cookies, sliced figs, and mascarpone mix until the glass is nice and full. Sprinkle a thin layer of raw sugar over the top and, using a small blow torch (available at any hardware department in the welding section), caramelize the sugar on top by moving the torch in swift, even motions over the top. If you’re a klutz or are afraid of open flames, you can absolutely skip this step, but the caramelized sugar adds a nice crunch to the whole thing. Garnish, with more fresh sliced figs and some fresh mint.
