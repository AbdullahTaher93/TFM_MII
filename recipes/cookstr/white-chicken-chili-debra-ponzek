In a large saucepan, bring the chicken pieces and stock to a simmer over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to medium and poach the chicken, skimming off any fat that accumulates on the surface, for 18 to 20 minutes, or until just done. Remove the chicken from the stock and set aside until cool enough to handle. Reserve the stock in the pan. Remove and discard the skin and bones from the chicken. Shred the chicken meat, set aside on a plate or in a shallow bowl, cover, and refrigerate until needed. In a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onions, celery, garlic, and jalapenos, if using, and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until softened but not colored. Remove from the heat and set aside. In the saucepan holding the reserved poaching liquid, mix together the white beans, cumin, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and simmer for about 1½ hours, or until the beans are tender but not mushy. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick. Stir in the shredded chicken and the sautéed vegetables and season with salt and pepper. Just before serving, stir in the cheese, parsley, and cilantro.
