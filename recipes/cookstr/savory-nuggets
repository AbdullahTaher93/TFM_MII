Pat the seitan pieces dry with absorbent paper towels and set aside. In a medium bowl, beat together the egg and soymilk. In another bowl, combine the cornmeal, arrowroot, and Savory Seasoning Blend. Heat 2-3 inches of oil in a 3- or 4-quart saucepan. While the oil is heating, dip the seitan pieces into the egg mixture, then coat the pieces with the seasoned cornmeal. Repeat this procedure, so the seitan pieces are dipped twice into the egg and cornmeal. Without overcrowding the pan, carefully deep-fry the seitan in small batches until golden brown and crispy (5-8 minutes). Place on absorbent paper towels to remove any excess oil. Arrange the hot nuggets on a platter and serve them plain or with your choice of dipping sauce. Try serving Savory Nuggets in the following way: Add to steamed vegetables and serve with a salad dressing.
