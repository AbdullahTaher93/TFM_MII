With spatula, spread sides of cheese with some of the mustard and roll in chopped nuts to coat sides. Spread remaining mustard on top and sprinkle with remaining nuts. Arrange nut-coated cheese on a microwave-safe serving dish. Microwave on Medium-Low (30%) for 1 ½ to 2 ½ minutes or until cheese is warm and softened. Surround with apple and pear slices and crackers. Serve immediately.
