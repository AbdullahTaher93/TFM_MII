With a mortar and pestle or the flat blade of a knife, mash the garlic and a pinch of salt into a smooth paste. Set aside. In a small bowl, whisk the yolks, mustard and lemon zest and juice together. Whisk in the oil drop by drop until the mixture begins to emulsify and thicken; then gradually increase the flow while whisking. When all of the oil has been added, stir in the garlic and season with salt if necessary.
