Put the cubed eggplant in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Let stand 1 hour to drain. Press out the excess moisture with the back of a spatula and pat dry with paper towels. Combine the eggplant, onion, bell peppers, tomatoes, and garlic in the slow cooker. Pour over the olive oil and toss to coat. Cover and cook on HIGH for 1 to 1½ hours, or on LOW for 2 to 3 hours. Stir in the zucchini. Cover and continue to cook on HIGH for another 1½ hours or LOW for 2 to 2½ hours. The last hour, add the basil and season with salt and black pepper. The vegetables will be cooked but will still hold their shape.
