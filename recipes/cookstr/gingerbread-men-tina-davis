Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ginger together into a medium bowl and set aside. Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and molasses and beat well. Gradually add the flour mixture and stir until the dough is thoroughly combined and comes together in a ball. Divide the dough in half and wrap each ball in plastic wrap; chill in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out one ball of the dough at a time on a lightly floured surface to ¼ inch thick. Lightly flour a cookie cutter and cut out gingerbread men; use a spatula to carefully transfer them to the prepared cookie sheets, 1 inch apart. Press currants or raisins into the cookies to make eyes, mouth, and buttons. Gather up the scraps and roll out and cut more cookies. Bake for 10 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then remove them to wire racks to cool. Repeat with the remaining dough.
