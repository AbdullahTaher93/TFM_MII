Preheat the oven to 375°F. Generously spray 12 cups of a muffin tin with flavorless vegetable oil spray. In a medium sauté pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until just shimmering. Add the zucchini and shallots and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, or until wilted and soft. Pour off or drain any excess moisture. Season with ¼ teaspoon of the salt and about 1/8 teaspoon pepper. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, Cheddar cheese, thyme, and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Season with a few grinds of pepper. Divide the zucchini mixture among the muffin cups. Top each cup with the egg mixture, dividing it equally among the cups. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until puffy, golden brown, and just set. Run a dull kitchen knife around the outside of each frittata and remove. Serve immediately.
