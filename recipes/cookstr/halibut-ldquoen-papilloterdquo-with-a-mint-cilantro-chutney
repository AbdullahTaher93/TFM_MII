Sprinkle the halibut all over with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the lemon juice and refrigerate 10 minutes. Rinse and pat the fish dry on paper towels. Stir together the yogurt, garam masala, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Pour over the fish and refrigerate 45 more minutes. Meanwhile, for the chutney, combine the ingredients in a blender and process until well blended. Preheat the oven to 450°F Cut a piece of aluminum foil about 15 inches long and lay it on a work surface, one of the short sides facing you. Brush the bottom half with a little oil. Set one fillet on top of the greased foil. Cut the fillet in half crosswise and remove the top half. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons chutney over the bottom half and cover with the top half. Spoon 1 to 2 more tablespoons chutney on top of the fish. Fold the top half of the foil rectangle over the halibut so that the top and bottom edges meet. Fold the bottom edge up about ¼ inch, and then fold it up twice more. Do the same on both sides to completely seal the halibut in the foil package. Repeat to make three more packages. Put the packages in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until the foil just begins to puff, about 10 minutes. Cut the packages open and slide the fish and chutney out onto plates. Serve hot.
