In a 2½-quart saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and swirl to coat the pan. Add the onion, cover, and cook until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the flour and ½ cup of the stock and stir until the flour is dissolved. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the remaining 2 cups stock and the cream to the pan with the onions, and bring to a simmer. Whisk in the flour mixture and simmer until the gravy thickens, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve.
