Mix the fish cubes in a bowl with the yogurt and half the chervil. Season with salt and pepper and leave to marinate. Preheat the grill to high. Place the fish pieces on skewers or line them in rows on a baking sheet, smearing over any excess yogurt from the bowl. Cook for about 5-10 minutes, depending on the size of the cubes of fish and the heat of the grill. They should be just firm to the touch. Serve the kebabs on a bed of rice or salad if you like, pour over the cooking juices and scatter over the remaining chervil or dill for a fresh taste.
