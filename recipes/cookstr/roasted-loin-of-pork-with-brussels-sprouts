Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a large roasting pan. Massage the pork loin all over with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Mix together the rosemary, sage, thyme, fennel seed, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and sprinkle all over the pork. Place the roast, bones down, in the pan. Roast until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted in the center of the roast reads 120°F, about 1 hour. Toss the Brussels sprouts with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large bowl. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Remove the pan from the oven, scatter the Brussels sprouts in the pan around the roast, and stir well to coat them with the pan juices. Return to the oven. Continue roasting until the pork reads 145°F when tested again with the meat thermometer, about 25 minutes. Transfer the roast to a serving platter and tent with aluminum foil. Stir the Brussels sprouts in the pan, and return to the oven. Continue roasting until the sprouts are tender, about 15 minutes longer. Transfer to the platter with the roast. Carve the roast and shingle the slices over the sprouts. Place the roasting pan on the stove over two burners on medium heat and cook until the pan juices sizzle. Add the broth and sherry and bring to a boil, stirring up the browned bits in the bottom and sides of the pan with a wooden spatula. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter to melt and lightly thicken the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour over the pork and serve immediately.
