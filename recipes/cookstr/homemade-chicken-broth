Put the chicken pieces in a large stockpot, then add the salt and enough cold water to cover the pieces. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Skim off the foam that collects with a spoon. Add the remaining ingredients, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Skim off any additional foam that collects as the broth cooks. Remove the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and reserve for another use. Pour the broth and vegetables into a large strainer lined with damp cheesecloth set over another pot. With the back of a spoon, press on the vegetables to release all the juices. Discard the solids left in the strainer. Let cool, then cover the broth with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. With a spoon, remove the congealed fat from the top of the broth. The broth is ready to use. It can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months.
