Combine the flour, pecans, oregano, cumin, thyme, cayenne, and salt to taste in a shallow dish. Melt 6 tablespoons of the butter in a small saucepan. Dip each chicken piece first in the butter, then in the flour mixture to coat well. Melt 3 tablespoons of the remaining butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half the chicken pieces and saut√© until browned on all sides and cooked through. Remove from the pan and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and the chicken. Serve the chicken morsels with toothpicks and your favorite mustard for dipping.
