Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Bring the butter and ½ cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and quickly beat in the flour and salt with a wooden spoon. Return to very low heat and stir until the dough is smooth and very lightly films the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and cool 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the beaten egg until the dough is glossy and thick. Stir in the cheese. Butter and flour a baking sheet. Using 2 dessert spoons, drop 16 balls of the dough, spaced well apart, on the baking sheet. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Remove from the oven and use a sharp knife to make a slit in the side of each puff to allow the hot steam to escape. Transfer the puffs onto a wire cake rack and let cool. For the filling, mix the ingredients until combined. Split each puff open and fill with a teaspoon of the mixture. Serve at room temperature.
