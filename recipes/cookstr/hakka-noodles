Fill a large saucepan three-fourths full with water, and bring it to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Add the noodles and cook until they are tender but still firm to the teeth (al dente), following the package instructions. While the noodles are cooking, whisk the ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, ground chiles, and salt together in a small bowl. Drain the noodles into a colander and run cold water through them to cool them off and stop the cooking. Preheat a wok or a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle the oil down the sides of the wok, and when it forms a shimmering pool at the bottom, add the paneer, cauliflower, carrot, garlic, and ¼ cup of the cilantro. Stir-fry until the cheese and vegetables are browned and crunchy-tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Fill a large bowl with warm water and dunk the cooled noodles into it to loosen them (and to provide the moisture that helps to rewarm them quickly). Drain them again and immediately add them to the wok (a little dripping water is just fine). Cook, stirring, until the noodles are warmed though, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the sauce and stir to coat the noodles and vegetables with its hot, salty, slightly sweet flavors. Stir in the tomato, scallions, and ginger. Cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, to warm the tomato, 2 to 4 minutes. Top with the bean sprouts and the remaining ¼ cup cilantro, and serve.
