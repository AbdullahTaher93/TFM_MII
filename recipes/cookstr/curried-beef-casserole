Position a rack in the top third of the oven, and preheat to 325Â°. Lightly butter a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, milk, and 1 of the eggs. Set aside. Heat the butter in a large skillet. Add the ground round, onion, and pear, and cook over high heat, stirring often, until the meat has lost its pink color, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, curry powder, lemon zest, and lemon juice, and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the almonds, apricots, salt, and cayenne. Remove the skillet from the heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly. Stir the meat mixture into the bread crumbs, and combine well. Transfer to the prepared baking dish, smooth the top, and place on a baking sheet. In a medium bowl, whisk the heavy cream with the remaining 4 eggs until smooth. Press the bay leaves into the top of the meat, and then pour the cream mixture over it. Bake until the custard is set and lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Serve, with a bowl of chutney passed alongside. .
