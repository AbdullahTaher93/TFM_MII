Sprinkle the frog legs with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and dip them in flour, preferably an instant variety, like Wondra, which gives a light coating and a nice crust. Heat about 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil in a skillet, preferably nonstick, and cook the frog legs for 2Â½ to 3 minutes on each side, until they are beautifully golden and lightly crusted. The flesh should remain moist and firm. Finish the dish with the garlic and the parsley, and stir in the butter. Add a dash of lemon juice and serve.
