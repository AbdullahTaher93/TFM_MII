Heat the milk, sugar, cinnamon stick, and lemon zest in a saucepan. When it reaches a boil (watch carefully so that it does not boil over), reduce the heat to a slow boil and cook for a minute. Return to a full boil, then reduce the heat again as before. Repeat four to five times until the milk is slightly thickened. Simmer for 5 minutes and cool down until barely warm. Pour the oil to a depth of at least 1 inch in a skillet (or better still, use a deep-fryer set at 360Â°F) and heat until the oil quickly browns a cube of bread. Place the bread slices in the warm milk and soak for about 1 minute on each side. Coat with the egg and pass directly to the hot oil. Fry until golden, turning once. Drain on paper towels. Arrange on a serving dish and sprinkle generously with sugar and cinnamon. Serve as soon as possible warm or at room temperature.
