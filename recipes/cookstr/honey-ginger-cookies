Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a cookiesheet and set aside. Place all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, (If the grated ginger is too fibrous, gather it in your hands, squeeze the juice into bowl, and discard the fibers.) Stir to form a moist dough. Knead the dough, then shape into walnut-sized balls. Place on the cookie sheet about ¾ inch apart. Flatten gently with a fork. Bake 15 minutes, or until they lose their shine. Remove from the oven, and cool at least 10 minutes before serving.
