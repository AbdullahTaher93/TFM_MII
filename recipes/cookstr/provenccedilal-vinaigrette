In a medium saucepan, heat Â¼ cup of the olive oil over medium heat until warm and add the shallots, garlic, tomatoes, anchovies, basil, and the remaining olive oil. Simmer over low heat for 30 minutes, then add the vinegar and allow to cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, strain through a chinois or fine strainer, pushing on the solids. Taste and add more olive oil or vinegar, if needed; season with salt and pepper.
