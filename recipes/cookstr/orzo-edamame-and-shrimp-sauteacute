Cook the orzo in a medium saucepan of boiling salted water just until very al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Drain well. Heat the oil in a large skillet over mediumhigh heat. Add the shrimp and scallions and toss just until they turn uniformly pink, about 2 minutes. Add the edamame, orzo and cilantro and toss until the edamame are warmed through. Add the soy sauce, scraping the bottom of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat, add the ginger and mix well. The orzo should be creamy; if not, add a tablespoon of water and toss again. Serve hot.
