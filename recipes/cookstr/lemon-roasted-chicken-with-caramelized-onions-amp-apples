In a large bowl, add the salt, pepper, lemon zest, and thyme. Add the chicken, toss to combine, and let marinate on the counter for at least 1 hour before cooking. You can also hold the chicken in the fridge for up to a day. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put the onions and apples on a large rimmed sheet pan, spreading them into a single layer and leaving space between them. Place the seasoned chicken pieces directly on top of the onions and apples, making sure they do not touch or overlap. Put the sheet pan in the oven and roast for 30 minutes. Without opening the oven door, reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and bake for another 30 to 45 minutes, until the chicken is golden brown and crisp. After the chicken has been roasting for 45 minutes, check the pan every 15 minutes through the oven door; if the onions along the edges are turning too dark, stir as needed (moving the dark onions to the center of the pan, where the heat is cooler) and redistribute the chicken pieces into a single layer before returning to the oven. After it's finished cooking let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken pieces to a serving platter and then spoon on the onions and apples, scraping up all of the brown bits. Garnish with a pinch of fresh thyme if desired. Serve immediately.
