Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut the squash and pumpkin into 1/2 –inch cubes and place on a baking sheet with sides and drizzle and toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and vinegar. Season with half the herbs, salt and pepper and place in the oven to roast 30 to 35 minutes until the squash is tender and slightly brown around the edges. Remove from the oven and set aside. Place the chicken broth in a saucepan and bring just to a boil. Turn the heat off and keep on the stovetop to keep warm. Heat the remaining olive oil and butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté, stirring frequently, until the onion is tender and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to sauté for 1 minute more, stirring constantly. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, until each grain is coated with fat. Add a little more oil if necessary. Cook and stir until the grains are well coated and begin to cook, about 3 minutes. The outside of each grain turns translucent, so it is cooked but not brown. Season with salt and pepper. Add the white wine and cook until most of it evaporates, about 30 seconds. Add about 1 cup of the chicken broth and cook, (enough to cover the rice) stirring constantly, until the rice absorbs most of the broth. Do not let the rice completely dry out. Continue adding broth 1 cup at a time, stirring each time until most of the broth is absorbed before adding more. The entire process will take 20-25 minutes. Cook the risotto until the rice is tender and creamy, it will be a little al dente. You might not need the entire 5 cups of broth. Stir in the cooked squash and pumpkin, along with any pan drippings and remaining herbs. Cook until the squash is warmed through, about 2 minutes. Add a little more chicken broth if the risotto gets too dry. Stir in half of the Parmesan. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Serve warm and top with the remaining Parmesan cheese.
