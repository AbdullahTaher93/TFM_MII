Melt the butter in a 2-quart flameproof casserole or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and saute, stirring constantly, until it is golden, about 5 minutes Heat the oven to 350Â° F. Stir the beans, cider, maple syrup, salt, and pepper into the onions. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Sprinkle the maple sugar over the beans and bake, uncovered, 20 to 30 minutes or until beans are bubbly and top is crisp.
