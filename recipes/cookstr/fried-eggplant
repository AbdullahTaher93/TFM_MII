Heat the olive oil to 365Â°F in a large deep skillet. Beat the eggs in a wide shallow bowl. Put the bread crumbs in another shallow bowl. Working in batches, dip the eggplant in the eggs and then in the bread crumbs, turning to coat, and add to the hot oil, without crowding. Fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with salt, and serve.
