Heat the oil and butter in a large flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. In batches, add the rabbit and cook, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes, until browned. Transfer to a plate. Add the onion and cook about 3 minutes, until softened. Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds. Stir in the cider and bring to a boil, then stir in the stock. Return the rabbit to the casserole, sprinkle with the thyme, and season with salt and pepper. Return to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes, until the rabbit is tender. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a small frying pan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes, until brown and crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Stir the mustard, créme fraîche, and honey into the casserole and bring to a boil. Serve hot, topped with the bacon.
