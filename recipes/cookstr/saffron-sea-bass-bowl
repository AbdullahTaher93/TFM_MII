1 In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and anchovies and saut√©, stirring to dissolve the anchovies into the oil, for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juice, broth, wine, bay leaf, thyme, parsley, and pepper. Stir well, then add the clam liquid and the saffron. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes to blend the flavors. Add the clams and sea bass and simmer just until the sea bass is opaque throughout, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the shrimp, if using. 2 Ladle into warmed bowls and garnish with the cilantro. Serve immediately.
