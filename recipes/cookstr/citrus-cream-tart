Mix the cookie crumbs and melted butter together. Press evenly in the bottom of a 9in (23cm) tart pan with a removable bottom. Refrigerate about 1 hour, until firm. Process the cream and condensed milk together in a food processor. With the machine running, add the zest and juice of the lemons and limes. Spread in the cookie crust and refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour or overnight. When ready to serve, remove the zest from ½ lemon and ½ lime with a vegetable peeler and cut into thin strips. Sprinkle over the tart and serve chilled. 3. When ready to serve, remove the zest from ½ lemon and ½ lime with a vegetable peeler and cut into thin strips. Sprinkle over the tart and serve chilled.
