Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Cut the squashes in half lengthwise, but leave the seeds intact. In a large, heavy ovenproof skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Place the squash halves, cut side down, in the butter and cook for a few minutes until browned. Turn the squash halves cut side up and transfer the skillet to the oven. Cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle the honey evenly among the 4 halves and serve.
