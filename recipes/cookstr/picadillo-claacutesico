In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the onion and bell pepper and sauté until the onion is translucent and softened, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the beef and sauté until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato sauce, olives, raisins, capers, vinegar, cumin, oregano, sugar, and salt. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the mixture’s consistency is like that of a sloppy Joe. Serve hot or use as a filling.
