Season the swordfish on both sides with salt and pepper. Using the 1 tablespoon olive oil, coat a baking dish just large enough to hold the swordfish. Put the swordfish in the baking dish and scatter the garlic around it. Sprinkle the surface of the fish with capers and parsley. Spoon the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon water over the fish. Cover the baking dish tightly with a lid or aluminum foil. Choose a large roasting pan or other deep pan that can take stovetop heat and accommodate the baking dish. Set the pan on a burner and put the baking dish in it. In a separate pan or teakettle, bring several cups of water to a boil for pouring into the roasting pan. Turn the heat to high under the roasting pan and add enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the baking dish. After the water returns to a boil, cook the fish for 8 minutes. Uncover and check for doneness; the fish should be cooked through but still moist and surrounded with flavorful juices. Taste the juices and add more salt if necessary. Serve the swordfish in shallow bowls, spooning the garlicky broth over the fish. Drizzle each portion with additional extra virgin olive oil.
