Cut the lemon in half and squeeze it into a bowl filled with 3 to 4 cups water. Using a sharp paring knife, cut off the tough outer leaves and thorny top leaves from each artichoke. Cut the artichokes in half-lengthwise and with a teaspoon scrape out any and all of the pinkish fuzz. Cut each half again in half lengthwise and drop immediately into the lemon water. Place the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, mint, pepper to taste, and feta in a blender and pulse together. Drain the artichokes from the lemon water, place in a bowl, add the feta vinaigrette, and toss. Serve immediately.
