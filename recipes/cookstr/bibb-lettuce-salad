Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). To make croutons, cut the sliced bread into quarters. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet. Bake for 10–15 minutes, or until crisp. Let cool. To make the dressing, process the egg, lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, and garlic in a blender. With the machine running, drizzle in the oil. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in a little water if the dressing is too thick. Cover and refrigerate until serving. Wash and dry the lettuce. Tear the lettuce into bite-sized pieces and place in a large bowl. Drizzle with the dressing and toss gently. Serve, topping each serving with the croutons and Parmesan shavings, if desired. 3. Wash and dry the lettuce. Tear the lettuce into bite-sized pieces and place in a large bowl.
