Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Generously butter and flour a nonstick, 12-cup Bundt pan, tapping the pan over the sink to remove excess flour. (Make certain every interior surface is thoroughly coated so the cake doesn’t stick.) To make the cake, in a large bowl, sift together the 3¾ cups flour, the cinnamon, cloves, and pepper. In another largo bowl, whisk together the molasses, granulated sugar, and oil. In a 2½-quart saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the baking soda. Whisk this mixture into the molasses mixture, and then add the fresh ginger. Adding a generous cupful at a time, stir the flour mixture into the molasses mixture, until the flour is absorbed. Whisk in the eggs. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake the cake for about 1 hour until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. If the cake appears to be browning too quickly, lay a piece of foil over the top of the pan. Transfer the cake to a wire rack and let cool in the pan for 1 hour. Place the rack over the top of the pan and invert to unmold the cake. Let the cake continue to cool on the rack. To make the whipped cream, combine the cream, confectioners sugar, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Using a whisk or electric mixer whip the cream until soft peaks form. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. To serve, using a small fine-mesh sieve, dust the confectioners sugar over the cake. Cut the cake into slices. Place a slice of cake in the center of each plate, top with a dollop of the whipped cream, and serve immediately.
