Beat the egg yolks with about half the sugar, till thick and very pale, then stir in the lemon zest. Beat the egg whites stiff with the salt. Add the remaining suger and beat to a very stiff, shiny meringue. Then fold in the yolk mixture. Sprinkle the flour on top and very gently fold in as lightly as possible. Turn into a deep, oiled, nonstick spring form cake pan about 9 inches (23 cm) in diameter and bake at 350°F (180°C) for about 1hour, until browned on top. VARIATION: You may add 2 or 3 drops of vanilla extract to the yolk mixture.
