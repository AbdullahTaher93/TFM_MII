For the conventional fines-herbes omelet: Mix the eggs, salt, pepper, and herbs together in a bowl. Melt the butter in the omelet pan. When the butter is hot and the foaming has subsided, pour the egg-herb mixture into the center of the pan, and cook it over medium heat for 10 to 15 seconds, allowing the eggs to set and curl at the edges. Then, with the tines of your fork, stir the eggs, so the runny part flows into the areas between the set curds. Repeat this process a few times. When most of the eggs are set but they are still slightly liquid in the center, the omelet is ready. Using a fork or a thin spatula, fold the omelet in half in the pan. You will notice that the underside will have a nice brown color, as opposed to the classic omelet, which has a pale-yellow exterior. Invert the omelet onto a plate, and serve it immediately.
