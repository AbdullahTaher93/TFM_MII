In a 2-cup liquid measure, combine the soymilk and lemon juice; set aside. (The mixture will curdle.) Set a large strainer or sifter over a bowl. Measure in the flour, cornmeal, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon. Stir or sift the dry ingredients into the bowl. Stir the oil and maple syrup into the soymilk. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the liquid. Stir with a fork just until blended. The batter should be medium-thick but still pourable; if it’s too runny, stir in a tablespoon or two more flour. Alternatively, if the batter becomes very thick as it stands, stir in a tablespoon or two of soymilk. When the waffle iron is ready, brush the top and bottom with oil or mist with pan spray. Pour a generous ½ cup of batter over the surface. Bake according to manufacturer’s directions until crisp, usually 5 to 6 minutes. Serve immediately or transfer to a cooling rack and keep warm in the oven while you are preparing the remaining waffles. Other Ideas: Add 2 tablespoons of shelled, unsalted sunflower seeds to the batter.
