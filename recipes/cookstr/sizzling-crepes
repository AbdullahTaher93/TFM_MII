Vigorously whisk all the batter ingredients except the scallions in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the scallions and set aside for at least 20-30 minutes. Heat an 8- to 12-inch nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet on high and add a generous amount of oil to coat the pan. Add 1/8 to ¼ of the total pork, shrimp, onion, and mushrooms, depending on how many crepes you plan to make. Stir gently while cooking for 30-45 seconds, or until starting to color and the onions can be smelled. Stir the batter well and add ¼-1/3 cup to the same pan; swirl around to coat evenly (you want a thin coating). Add about 3/4-1 cup of the bean sprouts and spread over half of the crepe. Lower the heat to medium, cover the pan until the bean sprouts have begun to soften, about 3 minutes or so. Uncover and cook another 3-5 minutes, or until the bottom of the crepe is crispy and golden brown. Lift one side with a spatula and gently fold in half. Serve on a platter with the lettuce, herbs, cucumber, and dipping sauces, or on individual plates or bowls for each diner to assemble his or her wraps.
