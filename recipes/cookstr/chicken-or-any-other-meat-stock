Combine all of the ingredients in a stockpot or slow cooker. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours in a stockpot, or 6 to 8 hours in a slow-cooker, until the broth is fragrant and flavorful. Cool, then strain, pressing on the solid ingredients to extract as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate, then skim excess fat once it hardens. Taste and adjust seasonings. Ladle into containers and refrigerate (for up to 3 days, or longer if you bring to a boil every third day) or freeze. 1. Combine all of the ingredients in a stockpot or slow cooker.
