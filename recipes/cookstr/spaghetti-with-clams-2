Put a large pot of water on to boil and salt it well. Drop the pasta into the boiling water and get to work on the sauce: Put the olive oil in a wide skillet or saut√© pan over medium-high heat. After a minute, add the garlic and cook it, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes, until it's deeply golden but not yet browned. Add the red pepper flakes. Then add the clams and reserved clam juice and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let them simmer for 4 minutes or so until the pasta is ready. Pull the pasta from the heat a minute or so earlier than its package indicates, drain it well, and put it on a large platter. Pour the clam sauce over the pasta and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and chopped parsley. Finish with lots of freshly ground black pepper at the table.
