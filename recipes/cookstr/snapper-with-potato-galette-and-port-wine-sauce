For the vegetables: Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Blanch the asparagus until tender, about 2 minutes, then remove with tongs and plunge into ice water. Drain. Repeat with the haricots verts. In a medium saucepan, heat the butter and stock over medium heat until simmering. Add the mushrooms and sauté until wilted. Add the tomatoes and the blanched asparagus and beans and toss until just warmed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the snapper: Preheat the oven to 450°F. In a large skillet or sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Season the flesh side of the fish with salt and pepper and place in the hot pan, flesh-side down. Immediately pan the pan in the oven and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until rare to medium rare. Return the pan to high heat and add the butter. Then turn the fish and keep it over the heat just until it forms a crust on the skin-side, 30 to 45 seconds. Turn the fish skin side up again and remove from the pan. To serve: Place a potato galette on each plate. Top with the vegetables and then the fish, and drizzle the sauce around them. Variations: Substitute zucchini for asparagus; string beans, wax beans, or a combination for haricots verbs; a mixture of cherry, pear, and regular tomatoes for pear tomatoes. Substitute bass or similar thin fillets for snapper. Substitute Red-Wine Salmon Sauce for port wine sauce; a drizzle of Basil Oil, Rosemary Oil, or Chive Oil for the sauce.
