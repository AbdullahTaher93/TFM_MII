Put the turkey parts, water, rice wine, ginger, and scallions in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove the ginger and scallions. While the stock is cooking, cut the turkey meat into Â¼-inch dice. Put the diced turkey in a bowl, add the Marinade, and toss lightly to coat. Add the turkey, onions, and barley to the stock, and continue cooking over low heat for 45 minutes, then add the carrots and celery and cook another 30 minutes. Remove the turkey bones, skim the surface to remove any impurities, and add salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into soup bowls and serve.
