Core the apples (do not peel), then cut into large chunks (about 2 inches). Put the apples and water in a pot over medium-high heat and cover. When the water begins producing vigorous steam, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples become quite tender and can be smashed with the back of a wooden spoon, 15 to 20 minutes. Process the apples through a food mill. Add sugar, taste, and add another tablespoon or two as desired. Thin with additional water, if needed. Serve cold or at room temperature.
