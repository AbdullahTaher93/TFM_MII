Alternate layers of shrimp, onion, lemon, dill clusters, and chopped parsley. Grind fresh pepper over each layer of shrimp. Place the bag containing the garlic in the center of the dish, where it can be removed before serving. Add the oil, which should come almost to the top of the shrimp. Cover the tureen or casserole, and let it rest in the refrigerator for 18 to 24 hours. Just before serving, remove the garlic bag. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, and add the bay leaves. Serve from the tureen, and provide small plates and picks or small forks.
