In a medium saucepan, combine the sherry, tamari, both sugars, 2 tablespoons of the ginger, the garlic, and scallions. Place over high heat, bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes. You want this sauce to reduce slightly, just barely coating the back of a spoon. Pour the sauce through a strainer and let cool. Divide the yakitori sauce in half. Put the pork tenderloins in a large zip-top bag, then pour half the yakitori sauce over the pork. Close the bag and squish the marinade around to coat the pork. Put in the refrigerator and marinate for 1 to 2 hours. Pour the remaining yakitori sauce into a small saucepan. Whisk in the plum preserves. Set over medium heat and bring to a simmer, whisking until the preserves dissolve. Reduce the heat so it is very low and cook the sauce slowly for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should readily coat the back of a spoon, or have the viscosity of honey. Oil the grill racks. Preheat your grill using all burners set on high and with the lid closed for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the pork tenderloins from the bag and discard the marinade. Place the pork on the grill and adjust the temperature to medium-high. Close the lid and cook, turning the tenderloins every 4 minutes. After 16 minutes, brush the tenderloins on all sides with some of the yakitori-plum sauce so that they are completely coated. Reserve the remaining yakitori-plum sauce for dipping. The tenderloin is done when it gives slightly to the touch or registers 145°F to 150°F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the grill to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. While the pork is resting, mix the lemon zest, peanuts, cilantro, and the remaining 2 tablespoons ginger in a small bowl. Slice the pork on the diagonal, transfer to a platter, and sprinkle with the gremolata. Serve with the reserved yakitori-plum sauce on the side.
