Works best in a large (minimum 5 quart) slow cooker. In a skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain on paper towel and crumble. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Drain fat from pan. Reduce heat to medium, add olive oil and heat for 30 seconds. Add onions to pan and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, lemon zest, peppercorns, bay leaf and allspice and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Transfer to slow cooker stoneware. Add broth and stir well. Stir in potatoes. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours or on High for 4 hours, until potatoes are tender. Discard bay leaf and allspice. Stir in paprika solution, kale and reserved bacon. Cover and cook on High for 20 minutes, until kale is tender. Working in batches, pur√©e soup in a food processor or blender. (You can also do this in the stoneware using an immersion blender.) Serve immediately.
