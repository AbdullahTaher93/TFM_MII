Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the cherries in an earthenware baking dish just large enough for the cherries to all lay flat. Sprinkle them with the sugar. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and gently place the cherries in a strainer for 15 minutes to drain off any excess liquid. Discard the liquid. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Wash and dry the same baking dish and then coat it with the butter. Beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Mix in the crème fraîche, heavy cream, and reserved vanilla bean seeds. Stir in the flour. Let this batter rest for 15 minutes. Place the cherries back in the buttered earthenware dish in one layer. Pour the batter over the cherries and bake for 35 minutes or until the top is firm and golden brown. Remove the clafoutis from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and serve.
