Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-low heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side, until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Discard all but 1 teaspoon of the bacon fat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to the skillet with the bacon fat and place over low heat. Add the onions, rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste, and stir well. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and pale golden. Combine with the bacon in a small bowl. Meanwhile, working on a well-floured surface, roll out half the dough into a square so that it’s a little less than ½ inch thick. Use a a-inch biscuit cutter or glass and cut out 12 round pizzettes. You may need to cut out 10 or 11 and then reroll the scraps of dough. Place the dough rounds on a cookie sheet, spacing them 1 inch apart. Repeat with the remaining dough. You should have 2 cookie sheets with 12 rounds on each. You can make the topping and the rounds a day ahead to this point; cover and refrigerate until ready to bake. Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 42.5 degrees F. Using a pastry brush or the back of a small spoon, coat each of the pizzettes with some of the remaining oil. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the cheese on top of each round. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the onion-bacon mixture on top and sprinkle another heaping teaspoon of cheese on top of the onion-bacon mixture. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the dough has puffed up slightly, turned a pale golden brown, and the cheese and topping are melted and hot. Serve hot.
