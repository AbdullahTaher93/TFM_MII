Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Prepare the tart dough: Sift the flours, sugar, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. On low speed, add the butter, bit by bit, and shortening and mix until the mixture is the consistency of fine cornmeal. Increase the speed to medium and slowly add the cold water, beating just until the dough forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Do not overmix. If the pastry is too dry, beat in a few drops of water on low speed. Turn the dough out onto a cool lightly floured surface. Smear the pastry on the surface with the heel of your hand for a final blending and form into a thick flat cake. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until just chilled, about 20 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, rapidly roll out the dough into a rectangle approximately 1/8-inch thick and to fit a large flat baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cover the pastry with the plum slices in rows, overlapping them slightly and leaving 1-inch border. Fold the rim of the pastry up to, and slightly overlapping, the plums. Dust the plums with 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes until the crust is browned. Dust with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.
