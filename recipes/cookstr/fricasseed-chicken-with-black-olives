Cut the chicken into 10 pieces. Wash it in cold water and put it in a colander to drain. After 15 to 20 minutes, pat it thoroughly dry with kitchen towels. Pit the olives, cutting the flesh away from the pits in pieces as large as possible. Set aside half the pitted olives, choosing the largest pieces; chop the other half very fine to a pulp and set aside separately. Choose a lidded sauté pan that can accommodate later all the chicken pieces without overlapping. Put in the oil and the garlic and turn on the heat to medium. Sauté the garlic in the uncovered pan until it becomes colored a pale gold. Add the chicken pieces and turn up the heat to high. Brown the chicken well on all sides, starting with the skin side facing the bottom of the pan to melt its fat. Sprinkle with a little salt and generous grindings of pepper. When you have browned the chicken well all over, turn down the heat to medium, remove the garlic, add the white wine and the vinegar, and cover the pan. When the liquid in the pan has evaporated by half, put in the chopped anchovies and the chopped half of the olives, turn the chicken pieces over, cover the pan, and continue cooking. Cook until the chicken is done through and through and feels very tender when pricked with a fork. Tilt the pan, pushing the chicken to one side to let the juices collect at the other end. Spoon off and discard most of the clear fat, but none of the brown cooking juices. Add the olive pieces, the parsley, and the basil and cook for 1 or 2 minutes longer, turning the chicken over once or twice. Add the lemon juice, turn the chicken pieces over, and transfer at once to a warm serving platter together with all the cooking juices in the pan.
