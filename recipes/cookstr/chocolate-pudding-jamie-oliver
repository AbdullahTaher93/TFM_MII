Preheat your oven to 375°F. Mix the cocoa powder with the boiling water to loosen. Stir until smooth. In a separate bowl, beat the sugar and butter until fluffy, and add the cocoa mixture, eggs, flour and baking powder. Mix well and fold in the dates, apricots, almonds and chocolate pieces. Pour the mixture into the cake pan. Bake for about 20–25 minutes in the middle of the oven, or until firm but springy when pressed. Melt the chocolate sauce ingredients in a bowl over some simmering water. Stir until blended well. When the pudding is cooked, remove from the oven and put to one side while the chocolate sauce finishes. Pour the sauce over. Serve at the table in the cake pan.
