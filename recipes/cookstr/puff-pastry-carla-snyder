Place all-purpose flour, cake flour, salt and butter in the mixer bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 1 hour. Attach the flat beater and mixer bowl to the mixer. Set to stir and mix for about 1 minute, until butter is the size of peas. Add ice water in a steady stream and mix until dough comes together in 2 or 3 clumps. Do not overmix. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat into an 8- by 4-inch (20 by 10 cm) rectangle. Using a metal spatula for support, fold dough into thirds, much as you would fold a business letter. (This is called a turn.) Turn the open end toward you. Using a rolling pin, roll out to an 8- by 4-inch (20 by 10 cm) rectangle. Fold into thirds again, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Place pastry on floured work surface and roll out to an 8- by 4-inch (20 by 10 cm) rectangle. Fold into thirds and turn the open end toward you. Roll out to a 12- by 4-inch (30 by 10 cm) rectangle. Starting with a short side, roll up jelly-roll style to form a tight cylinder. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll out as directed in the recipe.
