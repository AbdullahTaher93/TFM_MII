For the lamb sauce: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add the onion, carrot, mushroom stems, and garlic, and sauté for 5 minutes, or until barely tender. Add the herbs, peppercorns, and lamb stock, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by about half. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Remove the bay leaf. For the lamb: Preheat the oven to 450°F. In a large ovenproof skillet, heat the oil over high heat until just smoking sear the lamb on all sides. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast, meaty-side up, 5 minutes for rare, 6 to 7 minutes for medium, or 8 minutes for well done. Allow to rest 5 minutes before carving. To serve: Mound the ratatouille in the center of 4 serving plates. Slice the lamb thin and fan it over the ratatouille. Spoon 3 to 4 tablespoons of sauce around the lamb and drizzle about 1 tablespoon of basil oil around that. Variations: For lamb sauce, substitute Roasted Garlic-Black Olive Oil combined with a little basil or rosemary oil. For basil oil, substitute Rosemary Oil. For an elegant presentation, mold the ratatouille in a 5-inch ring and arrange the sliced lamb on top.
