Cut the tops off the pineapples and discard them. With a big knife, cut off the rind from the pineapples with as little pineapple attached as possible. Put the rinds in a pot large enough to hold them comfortably and pour in enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil and boil until the pineapple peel is very tender, about 30 minutes. Add water if necessary to keep the rinds submerged. Meanwhile, put the onion, oregano, peppercorns, garlic, peppers, vinegar, and salt in a large jar with a tight-fitting lid. Strain the pineapple liquid over the seasonings. If there is not enough liquid to cover the ingredients, cover the pineapple with water again and boil for 20 minutes. Taste and add salt and vinegar if you think it needs it. You can use it as soon as it cools, but it will get better as it sits. Keep at room temperature 1 day, then refrigerate.
