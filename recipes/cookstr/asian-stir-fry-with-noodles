Cut tofu in half lengthwise and place halves on a dinner plate. Cover with multiple layers of paper towel, then place a heavy object on top to force water out of tofu. Let sit 15 to 20 minutes. In a medium saucepan, bring broth and water to a boil. Add noodles and cook 6 to 8 minutes, or until just tender. Drain. Transfer to a serving bowl. Toss with sesame oil. Set aside. To make the sauce, combine one cup chicken broth with cornstarch in a small saucepan; stir until smooth and no lumps remain. Stir in soy sauce and chili sauce. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly until sauce thickens slightly. Set aside on stovetop to keep warm. To stir-fry vegetables, preheat a nonstick wok or skillet over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add olive oil. When oil is hot, add ginger; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add broccoli or broccolini, red pepper and snow peas; stir-fry 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and green onions; stir-fry 1 to 3 minutes. Remove tofu from covering and slice into 1-inch cubes; add to stir-fry. Stir gently 2 to 3 minutes. Pour vegetables over noodles and toss. Variation: Replace tofu with ¾ pound cubed skinless, boneless chicken breast or ¾ pound cooked medium prawns.
