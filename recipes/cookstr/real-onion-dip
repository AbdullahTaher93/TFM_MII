Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 20 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking, stirring often, until deep golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely. Mix the mayonnaise and sour cream in a medium bowl. Stir in the onions. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours, or up to 2 days. (If necessary, thin with milk before serving.) Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with chives. Serve chilled or at room temperature. Blue Cheese and Onion Dip: Mash 4 ounces Roquefort or Danish blue cheese, crumbled, into the mayonnaise-sour cream mixture. Original California Dip: Mix 1 envelope Lipton Onion Recipe Soup Mix with one 16-ounce container sour cream. Cover and chill for at least 30 minutes.
