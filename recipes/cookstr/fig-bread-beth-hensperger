Heat the apple juice and butter over medium-low heat in a small saucepan on the stovetop, or in a microwave-proof bowl in the microwave, until the butter is melted. Remove from the heat and add the figs and orange zest. Set aside to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Place the ingredients in the pan according to the order in the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, adding the apple-fig mixture with the liquid ingredients. Set the crust for dark, if your machine offers crust control for this setting, and program for the Quick Bread/Cake cycle; press Start. The batter will be thick and smooth. When the machine beeps at the end of the cycle, check the loaf for doneness. The bread is done when it shrinks slightly from the sides of the pan, the sides are dark brown, and the top is firm to a gentle pressure when touched with your finger, a toothpick or metal skewer will come out clean when inserted into the center of the bread. When the bread is done, immediately remove the pan from the machine. Let the bread stand in the pan for 10 minutes before turning it out, right side up, to cool completely on a rack. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill overnight or up to 3 days before serving.
