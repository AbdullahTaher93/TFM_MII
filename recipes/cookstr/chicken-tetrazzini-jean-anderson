Remove fat from body cavity of hen, then place hen, giblets, water, salt, onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, and peppercorns in a large, heavy kettle, cover, and simmer about 2 hours until tender. (Note: Chicken liver should be removed after 10-15 minutes, cooled, and reserved.) Cool hen in stock, then skin and cut meat from bones in bite-size chunks; also dice all giblets; skim stock of fat, strain, and reserve. For sauce, melt butter over moderate heat, blend in flour, add stock and remaining sauce ingredients, and heat, stirring, until thickened. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Cook pasta by package directions, drain and combine with sauce, mushrooms, chicken, and giblets, including liver. Place in a buttered shallow 3-quart casserole, sprinkle with topping, and bake, uncovered, 30-40 minutes until bubbly. Brown quickly under broiler and serve.
