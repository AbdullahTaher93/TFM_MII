Make the chimichurri sauce: In a food processor, combine the parsley, bay leaves, garlic, paprika, oregano, vinegar, olive oil, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Pulse until well mixed. Transfer the sauce to a glass or plastic container; you should have about 2½ cups. Measure out about ¾ cup for this recipe. Cover and refrigerate the remainder for other uses. Ready a charcoal grill or gas grill for direct heat grilling over a hot fire. Preheat the oven to 225°F. Make the chili water: In a small bowl, combine the paprika, 2 tablespoons salt, and the water and stir until the salt dissolves. Lightly brush the onion slices on both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the grill and cook, turning once, until well caramelized and softened, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. At the same time, season the steaks with salt and brush on some of the chili water. Place the steaks on the grill and cook, basting 2 or 3 more times with the chili water and turning once, until cooked to desired doneness, 4 to 6 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 4 minutes. Lightly brush the pita breads with olive oil and set on the grill, turning once, to heat for 1 minute. Remove from the grill. Cut the top 20 percent off each pita bread (save the trimmings for another use). Divide the blue cheese evenly among the pita breads, stuffing it into the pockets. Lay the pita breads in a single layer on 2 rimmed baking sheets and place in the oven to keep warm. Cut the skirt steaks across the grain into ½-inch-thick slices and place in a bowl. Add ½ cup of the chimichurri sauce and toss well. Remove the pita breads from the oven and place on warmed individual plates. Divide the meat and tomato slices among the pita breads, slipping them into the pockets. Pull the onion slices apart into rings and slip the onion rings into the pockets as well. Spoon 1½ teaspoons chimichurri sauce over each stuffed pita bread and serve at once.
