In a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the pancetta and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausage from the casing and crumble it into the pan; cook until browned. Add the beef, pear, raisins, garlic and sage. Cook the mixture until the pears are soft. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in salted water until it is almost al dente. Drain and toss into the sauce along with a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid. Stir well and cook, adding more cooking liquid, if needed, until the pasta is al dente. Stir in the zest and season with grated cheese, cinnamon, nutmeg and parsley to taste. Season with salt and pepper and serve the pasta topped with a sprinkling of amaretti crumbs.
