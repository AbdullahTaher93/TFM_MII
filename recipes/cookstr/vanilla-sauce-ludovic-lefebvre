Combine the milk and cream in a heavy medium saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the milk and cream mixture; add the bean. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in the hot milk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan. Using a heat-resistant rubber spatula, stir just until the custard thickens and leaves a path on the back of the spatula when a finger is drawn across, about 4 minutes (do not boil). Strain the custard sauce through a fine-mesh strainer and into a medium bowl set over a large bowl of ice water. Stir until the sauce is cold. Cover and refrigerate. Discard the vanilla bean before using. Serve the sauce cold.
