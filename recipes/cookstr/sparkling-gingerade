In a medium saucepan, combine water, ginger, lemon zest, sugar, honey, mint leaves, and cloves; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat; cool to room temperature. Strain into a pitcher; stir in lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours. To serve, place 3 to 4 ice cubes in tall glasses. Fill halfway with Gingerade; top with ginger ale, stirring gently. Garnish with mint sprigs.
