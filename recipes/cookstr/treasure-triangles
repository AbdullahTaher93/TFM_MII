Heat the butter in a medium sauté pan over high heat. Add the bananas and sauté until golden. Remove the bananas to a bowl. Add the onion to the sauté pan and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until clear and softened. Add to the bananas. Add the beans to the bowl. Using the back of a fork or potato masher, mash the bean mixture to a coarse paste; season with the salt and cool. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or spray it with cooking spray. Unfold each puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured cutting board. Cut each piece into 9 equal squares. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of cheese in the center of each square. Place 1 tablespoon of filling on top of the cheese. Fold 1 corner of the dough over the filling to the opposite corner, forming a triangle. Using a fork, seal the edges of the dough. Arrange the triangles on a rimmed baking sheet; brush with the egg wash. Bake the triangles for about 20 minutes, until golden brown and puffed. Variation See what you have on hand. Try pinto beans and corn, or cooked crumbled bacon and a dot of peanut butter.
