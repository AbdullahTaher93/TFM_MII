Cut the tortillas vertically into ¼-inch-thick strips. In a medium saucepan, heat ½ inch oil over medium heat until it shimmers. The edge of a tortilla snip inserted in the oil should sizzle vigorously. Add half the tortilla strips. Stir until they are golden brown and crisp. With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Pour off all but a thin coating of hot oil and return the pan to the heat. Add the garlic and onion and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, press the garlic against the side of the pan to leave behind as much oil as possible, then transfer the garlic to a blender or food processor. Add the chile pieces to the hot pan. Turn quickly as they fry, toast, and release a delicious aroma, about 30 seconds in all. (Too much frying/toasting will make them bitter.) Transfer to paper towels to drain. Set the pan aside. Add the tomatoes to the blender or food processor and process to a smooth puree. If using fresh tomatoes, strain the puree to get rid of the pieces of tomato skin. Heat the same saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the tomato puree and stir until it has thickened to the consistency of tomato paste, about 10 minutes. Add the stock and epazote (if you like), bring to a boil, then partially cover and gently simmer over medium to medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Add the salt. To serve, divide the cheese and avocado among warmed soup bowls. Ladle a portion of the broth into each bowl, top with a portion of the tortilla strips, and crumble on a little of the toasted chilies. Offer wedges of lime.
