For the Bruschetta Preheat a charcoal or gas grill to hot. Brush both sides of the bread with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill them on the cooler part of the grill until golden brown in the center and slightly burnt around the edges. They may not color evenly, but that is fine. Place the bruschetta on serving plates. Divide the topping evenly among them. For the Warm Duxelles and Potato Topping: Boil the potatoes in water to cover until tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Peel and finely dice while still warm. Place in a small bowl and gently toss with the duxelles, olive oil (if needed to moisten), and the chives. Spoon onto the bruschetta and serve. For the Grilled Portobello Topping: Cut the portobello caps into Â¼-inch dice. Mix with the herbs, spoon onto the bruschetta, and serve.
