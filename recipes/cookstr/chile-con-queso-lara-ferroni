Combine the butter, onion, and chiles in a saut√© pan over medium heat and cook until the onion softens and becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato and oregano and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the cream, buttermilk, and flour and bring to a simmer to thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in the Monterey Jack cheese and gently stir to melt. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, topped with the queso fresco.
