Preheat the oven to 350°F. Using a meat pounder, flatten each chicken breast to a thickness of ¼ inch and arrange them on your work table with the smooth outer side down. Season each breast lightly with salt and pepper and a pinch of the basil. Place about 2 tablespoons of the grated mozzarella in the center of each breast, leaving a ½-inch margin all around. Lay a slice of prosciutto over the cheese. Fold the breasts lengthwise, place on a platter, and set aside. S. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl. Put the bread crumbs in a pie plate. Dip each chicken bundle in the egg and then dredge it in the bread crumbs, holding it carefully to keep it from unfolding. Gently shake the bundle to release excess bread crumbs, then place it back on the platter, seam side down. Place a large frying pan on medium-high heat and let it get hot, about 45 seconds. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the center of the pan and place ½ tablespoon of the butter in the pool of oil. When the butter stops sizzling, spread it around the pan and add 4 of the breasts, seam side down. Cook until the bottoms are lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook 2 minutes more. Transfer these bundles to the baking pan. Wipe out the frying pan with a paper towel and repeat with the remaining oil, butter, and breasts. Place the chicken in the oven and bake until firm and springy to the touch, about 8 minutes. . While the chicken is baking, heat the tomato sauce in a small saucepan. Wash and dry the platter and arrange the cooked breasts on it. Top each one with a bit of tomato sauce and a sprinkling of parsley. Serve immediately.
