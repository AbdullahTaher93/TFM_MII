Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). With a small, sharp knife, make several deep cuts into the flesh of the lamb. Strip the leaves from 1 rosemary sprig, and push a few rosemary leaves into each cut. Place the lamb in a roasting pan, with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Bake for 1 hour. Combine the beans, tomatoes, garlic, and remaining rosemary. Remove the lamb from the oven and spoon the bean mixture around it. Mix the wine and tomato paste together and pour over the beans. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, then continue baking, stirring the beans after 15 minutes, for about 30 minutes, until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the lamb reads 130°F. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
