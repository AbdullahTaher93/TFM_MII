Prepare the Boston lettuce by breaking all the leaves apart and washing thoroughly under cold running water. Boston lettuce can be sandy inside, so be sure that the leaves are well washed. Dry the lettuce and tear into bite-size pieces. Place in a bowl and cover with damp towels. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Prepare the oranges by peeling them and cutting into sections. More simply, slice the peeled oranges crosswise, then cut the slices in half. Add the oranges and onion to the bowl with the lettuce. Pour some Ginger Dressing over the salad and toss. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately. Pass remaining dressing, if you like.
