Using paper towels, pat the tofu dry. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place the tofu slabs in the pan and cook without moving until golden, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the slabs to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Increase the heat to high. Add the mushrooms, chorizo, and the white and light green parts of the scallions. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the mushrooms are softened and light golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in the broth, soy sauce, and mirin. Cook until the sauce reduces and thickens slightly, about 1 minute more. If the tofu is no longer hot, push the vegetables in the pan to one side; add the tofu and cook until heated through. Transfer the hot tofu to serving plates and top with the mushroom mixture and pan sauce. Sprinkle with the dark green scallions.
