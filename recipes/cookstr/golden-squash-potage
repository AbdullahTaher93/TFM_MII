Cut the squash in half, remove the seeds, and peel (if not organic). Cut into 1-inch cubes. In a large pot, bring the water to a medium boil and cook the squash until tender (about 15 minutes). Reserving the cooking water, transfer the squash to a blender or food processor. Adding the reserved cooking water a little at a time, puree the squash to a creamy consistency. Return the squash to the pot and whisk in the salt, allspice, and soymilk. Cover the puree and keep it warm over low heat. In a heavy pan or skillet, cook the seitan slices in the oil until they are well-browned on both sides (about 5 minutes per side). Place on absorbent paper towels to remove any excess oil. About 10 minutes before serving the soup, add the seitan. Ladle the hot soup into individual bowls and garnish with a sprinkle of parsley.
