In a medium-size saucepan, heat the oil over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add the onion, garlic, scallions, and jalape√±o and cook until barely softened, stirring a few times, about 4 minutes. Add the orange juice and lime juice, season with salt, and simmer for 1 minute. Let cool completely before using.
