Place the joint in a large pan over the hob add the dry ginger ale, top up with some water if the ham is not just about covered with liquid. Bring the pan to the boil then lower the heat slightly so that it keeps bubbling gently for 4 and a half hours. Towards the end of the 4 and a half hours, pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F and begin the glaze. In a bowl, add the chunky ginger preserve. Stir in 2 tablespoons of hot English mustard. Add the soft, dark brown sugar and sprinkle in the ground cloves and stir to mix. After it's had its 4 and a half hours, gently lift the ham out of the pan and place on a foil-lined baking tray. Carefully cut away the skin, leaving a thin layer of fat. There is no need to score the surface, simply slap on the glaze and place the tray with the ham into the hot oven for 20 minutes. Serve hot or cold.
