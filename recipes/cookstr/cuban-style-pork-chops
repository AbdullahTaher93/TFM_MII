Place the pork chops in a nonreactive baking dish. Crush the garlic in a garlic press, then mix it with the oregano and cumin to form a paste. Rub the paste over the chops. Add the bitter orange juice and sherry. Cover and marinate, refrigerated, for 1 to 4 hours. Remove the chops from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Reserve the marinade. Place the Aceite de Achiote in a large skillet over medium-high. When it is sizzling hot, add the chops in small batches and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. As they are browned, remove the chops to a dish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, if using, and set aside. Add the onion to the skillet and saut√© over medium heat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the reserved marinade and return the chops to the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, turning the chops once or twice, until cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the chops to a warm platter and spoon the onions and pan juices over them. Serve.
