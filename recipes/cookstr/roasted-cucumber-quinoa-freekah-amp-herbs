Place the cucumber on a tray lined with a paper towel and sprinkle liberally with the salt. Let stand for 3 minutes, then rinse and pat dry with some more paper towels. This is to draw out the moisture of the cucumber so as not to make your salad soggy. Heat a large skillet over high heat, add the olive oil and cucumber and pan fry for about 4 minutes or until the cucumber is golden brown. Place in a bowl (I'd use the same bowl that you would like to present the salad in). Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl, except the yogurt and reserve a little of the herbs. Gently toss together and check the seasoning. To finish, spoon the yogurt over the top in small dollops, then sprinkle with the reserved herbs.
