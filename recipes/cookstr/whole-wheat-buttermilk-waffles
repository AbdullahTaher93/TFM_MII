Put the flours into a mixing bowl and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Stir with a fork to blend. In another mixing bowl, beat the eggs until well blended. Stir in the buttermilk and the melted butter (cooled off a little). Add the flour mixture and stir until well mixed—if the batter seems rather thick, add the ¼ cup milk to thin it. The batter should flow from the spoon, not plop. Bake in a hot waffle iron until crisp and golden. Serve hot.
