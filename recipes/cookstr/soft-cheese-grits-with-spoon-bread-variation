In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring the water to a boil and slowly stir in the grits, salt, and garlic. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the grits are thick and soft, about 10 minutes. Whisk in the grated cheese and the cream. Keep the grits hot in a water bath, stirring occasionally, for up to 1 hour. More water may be whisked in to thin the consistency of the grits, which will thicken as they sit.
