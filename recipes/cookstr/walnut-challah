Set aside 1 egg and walnuts. Using remaining ingredients above, prepare Basic Challah Dough, Prepared By Food Processor through step 4. Grease a 9 × 5-inch loaf pan. After dough has risen for second time, pat out dough into a 9-inch square. Sprinkle evenly with all the walnuts. Press them into dough. Roll up tightly in a cylinder, pressing firmly. Pinch ends and seam tightly. Then roll cylinder again on work surface to press seam further. Place in pan seam-side down. Cover loaf with a warm, slightly damp cloth and let rise until nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375°F. Beat remaining egg with a pinch of salt. Brush risen loaf gently with beaten egg. Bake about 45 minutes or until top and bottom of bread are firm and bread sounds hollow when tapped on bottom. Run a metal spatula or a thin knife carefully around bread. Turn out of pan and cool on a rack.
