Make caramel and add the blood orange juice (see the Note on cooking caramel successfully): In a heavy-bottomed saucepan combine the sugar with Â¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons water and either the cream of tartar or the lemon juice. Cover and cook over high heat until the syrup comes to a very rapid boil. Remove the cover and continue to cook at medium-high heat until the sugar takes on a golden brown caramel color. Remove from the heat, stand back, and slowly add the blood orange juice. The mixture will bubble and steam furiously. When the bubbling has subsided, return to the heat. Whisk the caramel and then let mixture come to a rolling boil. Immediately remove from the heat. Transfer to a bowl and place in the refrigerator to chill before serving. Serving Suggestions: Serve this sauce cold or at room temperature with any citrus or chocolate dessert. I also recommend the Candied Kumquat Mascarpone Parfait, Meyer Lemon Curd Tart, and Goat Cheesecake.
