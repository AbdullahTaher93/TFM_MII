Place the dried apples and currants in a large plastic zippered bag, add the calvados, and seal the bag. Allow to steep in the refrigerator overnight. When ready to serve, gently warm the cider and spices in a potâ€“do not allow the mixture to boil. Meanwhile, remove the apple slices from the plastic bag and dredge each in the brown sugar. Pour a healthy shot of rum into each mug and add the cider. I do not mind if the mulling spices get into the finished drink, but if you prefer your drink without the spices, you may pour the cider through a fine-mesh strainer into the mugs. Float one or two sugared apple slices on each drink, spoon the currants over the apples, add a long cinnamon stick, and serve. Spiked Pear Cider: Prepare the hot spiked cider using pear cider in place of the apple cider, Poire William (a pear eau-de-vie) instead of the calvados, and dried pears instead of the dried apples.
