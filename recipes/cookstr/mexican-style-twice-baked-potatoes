Preheat the oven to 350°F. Prick the potatoes with a fork or the tip of a sharp knife several times. Bake until tender, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly, then cut each potato in half lengthwise and scoop the pulp into a bowl, leaving the shell intact. With an electric mixer or a potato masher, beat or mash the pulp. Add the sour cream, milk, salt, and pepper and beat until fluffy. Stir in the cheese and green onions, if using. Spoon the potato mixture back into the shells. Place on a baking sheet and bake until heated through and lightly browned. 20 to 25 minutes. Variation: For Mexican-style twice-baked potatoes. Use pepper Jack cheese instead of Cheddar cheese. Add ¼ cup salsa and sprinkle with chopped fresh cilantro instead of the green onions.
