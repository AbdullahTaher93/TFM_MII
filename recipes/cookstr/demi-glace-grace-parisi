Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the flour, stirring to coat the vegetables, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom, and cook until evaporated. Stir in the tomato paste, then add the stock and bouquet garni and bring to a boil. Position the saucepan so that it is sitting half on the burner. Simmer over low heat until slightly thickened and reduced by half, about 1 hour, skimming the scum that rises to the surface from time to time. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve or several layers of cheesecloth into a heatproof bowl, pressing hard on the solids. Let the fat rise to the surface and skim off as much as possible. Return the sauce to the saucepan and simmer over medium heat until reduced to 2 cups, about 10 minutes longer. Season with salt.
