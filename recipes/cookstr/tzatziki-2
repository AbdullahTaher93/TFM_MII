Line a colander with a double layer of cheesecloth. Place the colander over a bowl deep enough to catch draining juices without the juices touching the bottom of the colander. Set aside. Using a box grater, grate the cucumber through the medium holes into a mixing bowl. Add a pinch of salt and toss to combine. Transfer the cucumber to the colander and allow the juices to drain for 1 hour. Pull the cheesecloth up and twist the ends together to squeeze any remaining juice from the cucumber. Transfer the well-drained cucumber to a clean nonreactive container with a lid. Add the yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, mint, and dill. Season with salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight before serving. Serve chilled with warm pita bread triangles.
