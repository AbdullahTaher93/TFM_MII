Heat the butter and oil in a large, wide pot over low heat, add the lamb, onion, celery, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, cayenne, and saffron and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes, until lamb browns lightly. Add the tomatoes. Raise the heat, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until slightly thickened. Season with salt. Add the lentils to the pot along with 6 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 1Â½ hours until the lamb is very tender. Add the chickpeas, parsley, and cilantro and cook another 5 to 7 minutes, until the chickpeas are warmed through. Add the lemon juice and serve.
