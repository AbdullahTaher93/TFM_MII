Combine the shrimp, oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, black and red pepper; toss to blend. Cover and marinate 1 to 24 hours. Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water until half cooked, about 10 minutes; add the cauliflower and cook with the pasta until both are tender, about 10 minutes longer. Ladle out ½ cup of the pasta cooking liquid; reserve. Drain the pasta. Meanwhile, heat the ½ cup oil in a medium skillet over low heat; stir in the garlic; saute until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the red pepper; saute 30 seconds. Remove from heat. Heat another skillet over medium heat; add the shrimp and marinade and stir-fry until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, toss the cooked pasta and the cauliflower with the reserved pasta cooking liquid, red pepper oil, the cooked shrimp, and the parsley. Serve at once.
