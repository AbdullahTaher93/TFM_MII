Measure the cornmeal into a medium bowl. Add the chicken pieces and toss them in the cornmeal with your hands. Shake off the excess cornmeal and place the chicken pieces on a large platter or baking sheet. Place a frying pan on high heat and let it get very hot, about 1 minute. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, the sausage, bell peppers, and onion, and saut√© for 1 minute more. Transfer the vegetables and sausage to a medium bowl. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the frying pan and let it get hot, about 30 seconds. Add the chicken pieces and brown, turning so they cook on all sides, about 6 minutes. Return the sausage and pepper mixture to the frying pan. Add the wine and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the chicken stock or bouillon, tomatoes, chili seasoning, and cilantro, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes. Serve hot over brown rice.
