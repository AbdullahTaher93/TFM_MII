Make the kimchee: In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, chile peppers, and sugar and whisk together well. In a medium bowl, toss the cabbage, cucumber, red pepper, and carrot together. Add just enough of the dressing to moisten the vegetables and mix well; refrigerate. Place the short ribs in a large bowl. Combine all the marinade ingredients in a small bowl and pour the mixture over the short ribs. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. Meanwhile, light a fire in your grill. Remove the meat from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels; discard the marinade. When the fire has died down and the coals are very hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the heat source for only 1 to 2 seconds), place the meat on the grill and sear well on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn and continue cooking to the desired doneness, about 3 minutes more for rare. Remove the meat from the grill, cover loosely with foil, and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Serve the ribs hot, accompanied by the kimchee.
