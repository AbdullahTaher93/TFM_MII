For the spiced crème fraîche: Combine the crème fraîche, cloves, ginger, and cinnamon in a small bowl, beat until the mixture forms stiff peaks, and reserve. For the soup: In the pot, the stock should cover the vegetables by about 1½ inches. Yams thicken the soup (pumpkin alone wouldn’t do it) and no other thickener is needed. Place the yams and pumpkin in a large pot over medium-high heat, cover with 8 cups of the chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer until tender, about 45 minutes. Pour the cooked vegetables and stock into a food processor or blender and puree until it has the consistency of heavy cream. Strain through a fine strainer and return to the saucepan. Add the spices, heated crème fraîche, and additional stock if needed to thin. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately, garnished with a dollop of spiced crème fraîche. Variations: Make with all yams and no pumpkin or all or part butternut squash. Delete the crème fraîche for a less rich soup.
