Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly oil 2 large baking sheets. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each on a very lightly floured work surface into an 8in (20cm) round. Arrange 2 rounds on each sheet. Spread each with 1/3 cup tomato sauce, leaving a 1in (2.5cm) border. Divide the mozzarella evenly over the pizza tops. For each pizza, arrange the mushroom slices on one quarter of the pizza round. Arrange the red peppers and 4 anchovy fillets on another quarter of the round. Cover a third quarter with the pepperoni and capers, and finally top the fourth quarter with 4 artichoke pieces and 3 olives. Drizzle the oil evenly over the pizza. Bake for 20–25 minutes, until the edges of the dough are crisp and golden brown. Serve hot.
