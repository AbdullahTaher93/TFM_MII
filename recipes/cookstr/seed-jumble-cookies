Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper, or spray with nonstick spray. In a small bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, agave nectar, vanilla, almond butter and tahini until smooth. In a medium bowl, stir together the remaining ingredients. Pour the wet mixture over the dry and stir to combine well. The mixture will appear a bit crumbly and you may wonder if it will stick together enough; this is as it should be. Using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon (15 cm), drop mounds of the mixture about 2 inches (5 cm) apart on cookie sheets (you may need to press the edges a bit for it to hold together). Bake for 10-15 minutes, rotating sheets about halfway through, until golden. Allow to cool completely before removing from the sheets (cookies will firm up as they cool). May be frozen.
