To make the filling, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until transparent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, oregano, bay leaf, salt, sugar, and hot pepper puree. Cover and cook over low heat for 10 minutes. Add the wine and chicken broth and cook, uncovered, until thickened. Stir in the chicken and raisins (if using) and continue to cook for a few minutes, until the sauce has thickened a little more. Discard the bay leaf and taste for salt and sugar. Let cool, then refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. To make the huminta, place the corn in a food processor and process until smooth. Mix the cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar together in a small bowl and add to the food processor. Add the eggs, egg white, and pisco. Process until smooth. Add the butter and cheese and pulse until well mixed. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously butter a shallow 6-cup baking dish. To assemble the torte, spread half of the huminta in the prepared dish. Spread the chicken mixture on top and cover with the rest of the huminta. Brush with the beaten egg white and bake on the middle oven rack until golden and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. It can be made ahead, cooled, and refrigerated. To serve, bring to room temperature and bake in a preheated 350°F oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.
