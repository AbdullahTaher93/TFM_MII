In a bowl, combine 1 cup boiling water and dates. Soak 20 minutes. Mash dates with your hands. Add remaining 2 cups boiling water. Let stand 5 minutes. Drain through a medium-mesh sieve set over a large bowl. Strain again through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing mixture with a wooden spoon to extract as much of the thick liquid as possible. Discard pulp. Pour liquid into a large, non-reactive saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, to prevent mixture from sticking to sides of pan, until it reduces to the consistency of honey, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool. Transfer to a glass jar with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate for up to 3 months. Serve with wedges of warm griddle bread, or blend with equal parts almond butter or ground sesame seeds to create an unusual spread.
