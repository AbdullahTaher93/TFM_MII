Preheat the oven to 375°F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large Dutch oven or saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook an additional 1 minute. Raise the heat to medium-high, stir in the mushrooms, zucchini, carrot, and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are softened, about 8 minutes. Add the turkey and thyme and cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the pasta sauce, heat through, and set aside. Heat the remaining oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk the milk and nutmeg slowly into the flour mixture. Raise the heat and bring to a low boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat, simmer, and stir until the mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. To assemble, lightly oil or coat a 9 x 13-inch baking pan or dish with nonstick cooking spray. Spread 1 cup meat mixture on the bottom. Lay 5 noodles on top, allowing them to overlap. Break the fifth noodle into a few pieces and fill in empty spaces. Top with ¾ cup béchamel sauce, ¼ cup Parmesan, 2 cups meat mixture, and ¼ cup mozzarella. Repeat with a second layer of 6 noodles (overlapping and two broken), ¾ cup sauce, ¼ cup Parmesan, the remaining meat, and ¼ cup mozzarella. Top with the remaining noodles, béchamel sauce, and cheese. Cover loosely with foil and bake until bubbly, about 50 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the cheese melts, 5 minutes.
