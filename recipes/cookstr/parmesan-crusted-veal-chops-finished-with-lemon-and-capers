1 In a shallow bowl, combine the cheese, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper and mix well. In another shallow bowl, whisk together the egg and water just until blended. Spread the flour on a plate. Coat a veal chop on both sides with the flour, tapping off the excess. Dip the chop into the egg mixture, then dip it into the cheese mixture, coating it on both sides. Set the chop aside on waxed paper and quickly repeat with the remaining 3 chops. 2 In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. When it is hot, add the chops and fry, turning once, until a golden crust has formed on the exterior, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. If the chops are browning too quickly, reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook until cooked through but still faintly pink at the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a warmed platter or individual plates and keep warm. 3 Pour off all but 1 teaspoon of the oil from the skillet. Return the pan to medium-high heat, add the lemon juice, and stir to scrape up any bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to low, add the capers, and cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds. 4 Pour the lemon juice and capers evenly over the chops and serve immediately.
