To Make the Lettuce Wraps: Heat oil in a wok or skillet on moderately high heat. Add galangal, garlic, and chili and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ground chicken and stir-fry for 4 minutes. Add water chestnuts and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add fresh coriander leaves, green onion, lemongrass, fish sauce, crushed red pepper, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl. Serve chicken mixture with lettuce leaves and Ginger Lime Dipping Sauce, allowing guests to form their own wraps. To Make the Dipping Sauce: Bring sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cool slightly. Mix 1/4 cup (65 ml) of the syrup with the ginger, lime juice, vinegar, fish sauce, and chili in a small bowl. Transfer to a small serving bowl. Discard the remaining syrup.
