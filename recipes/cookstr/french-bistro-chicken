Preheat the oven to 350° F. Heat the olive oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the chicken pieces in batches, starting skin side down and turning, until nicely browned all over. Transfer the chicken to a large baking pan and arrange the pieces in a single layer. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons fat from the skillet. Add the shallots and sauté until lightly browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the vermouth and lemon juice; cook, stir to deglaze, scraping up any brown bits clinging to the bottom of the skillet. Stir in the tarragon and season with salt and pepper. Add the artichoke hearts and toss to combine. Pour this mixture around the browned chicken pieces. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake until very tender, about 45 minutes. Pour the accumulated juices from the chicken into a small saucepan. Add the chicken broth and boil until reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve at once.
