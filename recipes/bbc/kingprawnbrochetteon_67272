In a pestle and mortar pound the marinade ingredients (the chilli, ginger, garlic, lime juice and oil) and add the prawns, allowing them to marinate for 1 hour.Once the prawns have marinated, skewer them on to the wooden skewers - about four per skewer depending on the size of the prawns.On a hot griddle pan place the prawn skewers and cook for a couple of minutes on each side (the prawns will turn pink).Meanwhile prepare the salad ingredients and mix the dressing in well - almost bruising the vegetables.Serve the salad in the middle of a plate and place two skewers on top and eat immediately.
