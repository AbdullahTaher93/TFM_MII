Add the vanilla seeds and bicarbonate of soda, mix to combine and leave to soak.In a clean bowl, cream the butter with the sugars using an electric whisk. Beat in the egg a little at a time then gently fold in the flour and spices. Pour in the date mixture and stir well.Divide the mixture equally between the prepared basins, they should be roughly two-thirds full. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until well-risen and springy to the touch. Allow to cool and then remove from the moulds.To make the sauce, combine all ingredients in a large saucepan and place over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved.To serve, pour a small amount of sauce over each pudding (as desired) and finish with chopped walnuts.
