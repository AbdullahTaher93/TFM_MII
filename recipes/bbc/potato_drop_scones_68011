Drop heaped dessertspoons of the mixture into the pan, spacing them slightly apart, and fry for 3-4 minutes, turning once, until golden-brown.Transfer to a serving plate and keep warm while frying the remainder of the potato mixture.Divide the scones between four plates, topping each plate with two rashers and two tomato halves.
