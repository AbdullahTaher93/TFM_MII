Preheat the oven to 160C/180C Fan/Gas 3.To braise the beef cheek, heat the oil in an oven-proof dish, add the beef cheek and sear on all sides to seal. Remove from the pan and set asideAdd the vegetables and the bay leaf and cook for 3–4 minutes until  soft. Place the beef cheek back in the dish, add the wine and cook until the liquid has reduced in volume by half. Add the stock, season with salt and pepper and place in the oven for 2–3 hours or until the meat falls off the cheek  easily.For the empanadas, blitz the flour, baking powder and butter in a food processor, adding a little water to bind. Wrap the dough in cling film and rest in the fridge for 1 hour.Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat and gently fry the onion, garlic, spices and tomato purée. Stir in the cooked beef cheek and capers. If the mixture is too dry, add some cooking jus to loosen. Cook until hot through.To assemble the empanadas, remove the pastry from the fridge, and roll out to the thickness of a pound coin (3mm). Cut  circles from the pastry, using a 10cm/in saucer or pastry cutter. Line a baking tray with baking paper.Put 2 heaped teaspoons filling on one half of each pastry circle. Wet the edges of the pastry with a little water, fold the non-filled half of each pastry over the filled half, and crimp the edges or use a fork to seal. Brush with the egg, place on the baking tray and bake for 25 minutes.Meanwhile, heat a large griddle pan over a high heat and grill the sweetcorn, turning occasionally, until all sides are chargrilled and browned.Cut the kernels from the cob by holding the corn on its base and running a sharp knife down from top to bottom. Mix the kernels with the mayonnaise, chipotle, cotija, garlic, lime juice, spring onions and jalapeños. Serve with the empanadas.
