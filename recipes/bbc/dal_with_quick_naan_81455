For the dal, heat the oil in a sauté pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the cumin seeds and chilli flakes and fry for 20 seconds, or until the seeds start to pop.Add the onion and cook for 2–3 minutes, or until just softened. Add the garlic, ginger, ground cumin, coriander, turmeric and salt and cook for 1 minute.Add the lentils, tomatoes, stock cube and 400ml/14fl oz of water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10–15 minutes.Meanwhile, for the naan breads, tip the flour, salt and sesame seeds into a large bowl and mix well. Make a well in the centre and add the yoghurt and 75ml/2½fl oz of cold water. Mix together to form a soft dough.Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 1–2 minutes, or until it forms a smooth dough. Divide it into six pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Flatten each ball gently using the palm of your hand, then roll it out to a 5mm/¼in-thick circle.Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium–high heat. Add two of the breads and cook for 1–2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and puffed up. Repeat with the remaining breads, keeping the cooked breads warm in a very low oven.Add the coriander to the dal and stir. Serve with the Greek yoghurt and naan breads.
