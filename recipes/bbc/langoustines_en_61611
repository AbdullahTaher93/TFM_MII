Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3½.Boil the Jersey Royals for 10–15 minutes, or until tender, then cool in cold water and set aside.To make six parcels, lay kitchen foil on top of greaseproof paper and cut out six 30x40cm/12x16in rectangles. Fold each rectangle in half and cut into half of a heart shape, then unfold into a heart.Lay the hearts foil side-up and brush each one with some rapeseed oil, then place three Jersey Royals in the middle of each piece of foil and crush lightly with a fork. Place two asparagus spears on top of each, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little more rapeseed oil.Place the honey in a small saucepan over a low heat to warm through. Add the lemon and ginger juices and season with salt and pepper. Place six langoustines on top of each parcel and drizzle with the honey, lemon and ginger juice mixture.Seal the pouches and bake for 7 minutes. Place each parcel in the centre of a plate, open and serve.
