For the marinated chicken, mix together all the ingredients in a bowl, cover with cling film and put in the fridge aside to marinate while you make the sauce.For the tikka masala sauce, bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan. Add the sliced onions, garlic and ginger. Cut a square of baking paper or greaseproof paper large enough to cover the mixture in the pan. Push it right down to cover the onions and garlic closely, cover the pan with a lid and simmer very gently for 15 minutes.Remove the paper. The onions should be translucent and soft. Add the tikka spice powder, the tinned tomatoes and the chopped coriander and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer briskly for 20-30 minutes, until the sauce is thickened. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper then set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile, preheat the grill to its hottest setting. Cover a baking tray with foil, and then place the marinated chicken on the tray in a single layer. Grill the chicken for 15 minutes, or until the chicken pieces are cooked through. Give the chicken a turn halfway through cooking, to ensure it’s nicely browned all over.Using a stick blender or food processor, blend the tikka masala sauce until smooth. Return to the heat and warm through, then add the plain yoghurt. (Don’t boil the sauce after you add the yoghurt or it will split.) Stir the cooked chicken pieces into the sauce and serve with brown basmati rice and a sprinkling of coriander to finish.
