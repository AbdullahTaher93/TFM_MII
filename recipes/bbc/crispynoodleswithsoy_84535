Do not leave unattended).Lower the noodles into the hot oil and deep-fry until crisp and golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.For the pesto, place all of the pesto ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth.To serve, place the crisp noodles into a bowl, add the chilli and soy sauce and mix well. Add a spoonful of pesto and serve.
