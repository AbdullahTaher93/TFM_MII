Boil the kettle. Break up the noodles and put into a bowl. Cover with boiling water, set aside, and allow the noodles to soften completely - about 10 minutes.Meanwhile, add the white part of the spring onion to a saucepan with the coconut milk, stock and a twist of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, add the chicken thighs and cook for 15-20 minutes. Don’t boil it or the chicken will be tough and the coconut milk will separate (If you use boneless chicken thighs simmer for 8-10 minutes).Remove the chicken from the saucepan and check that it is completely cooked. If it’s pink near the bone, return it to the stock for another 5 minutes. When cooked, set the chicken thighs aside to cool slightly.Drain the noodles and add them to the coconut liquid. Chop the chicken from the bone and stir into the soup with the green part of the spring onion. Season with salt and black pepper.
