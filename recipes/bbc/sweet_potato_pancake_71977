Grate the sweet potato and squeeze it dry in some kitchen roll.Put 2 teaspoons of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add a handful of the sweet potato to the hot oil, press it down with a spatula and fry over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes. Flip the pancake over and fry on the other side until it is dark brown and cooked through. Repeat this process to make 3 more pancakes.Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a frying pan and fry the onion for 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the kidney beans, chilli powder, cumin, chilli flakes and chopped tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the sauce has thickened â€“ this should take about 5-10 minutes.Divide the pancakes between 4 plates, top with the chilli and serve.
