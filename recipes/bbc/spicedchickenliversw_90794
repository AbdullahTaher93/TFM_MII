Place the livers into a bowl and cover with the milk. Add the ice cubes, cover with cling film and leave to soak in the fridge for at least one hour. Drain the livers and pat dry with kitchen paper. Discard the milk.Season the livers with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add the vegetable oil and butter to the pan, and heat until the butter starts to foam. Add the chicken livers and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown all over (you may need to do this in batches so as not to crowd the pan). Add the ginger to the pan and fry for a further 30 seconds, then add the brown sugar, peppercorns, soy sauce and the sherry. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced enough to glaze the livers.Remove the livers with a slotted spoon to a warm plate.Add the cream and fresh coriander to the pan, and bubble for 3-4 minutes, or until the cream thickens slightly.To serve, pile the egg noodles on a serving plate, top with the livers and drizzle the cream sauce over.
