Place into the oven to finish cooking for 3-4 more minutes, or until just cooked through.For the gazpacho, cut off the tips of the asparagus spears and blanch in a pan of boiling water for one minute, then drain and refresh in iced water. Set aside.Boil the asparagus stems in a pan of boiling water for 8-10 minutes, or until very soft. Allow to cool in the liquid.Mix the extra virgin olive oil, sherry vinegar, bread and garlic together in a large bowl and set aside for ten minutes.Transfer the bread mixture to a food processor along with the asparagus stems, cucumber, chilli and tarragon and blend until smooth. Add enough of the asparagus cooking liquid to thin out the gazpacho to your desired consistency, and blend again.
