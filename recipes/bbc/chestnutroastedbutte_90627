Set aside to cool.When the butternut squash has cooled, drain off the oil and peel away the skin, taking care not to burn your fingers.Heat the remaining olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat, add the onion, garlic, potatoes and apple and fry for 4-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until softened.Add the stock, roasted squash, thyme, bay leaves, chestnuts and the chestnut pur√©e. Stir well and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Bring the mixture to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Set aside to cool.Transfer the mixture to a food processor and blend until smooth. Return to the pan and heat until warmed through.To serve, divide the soup equally between ten serving bowls. Garnish each serving with a few drops of truffle oil and cream (if using) and sprinkle over the sliced roasted chestnuts.
