Put the chicken breasts on a board and cover with a piece of foil or baking paper. Bash them with a rolling pin until just under 2cm/¾in thick all over. Put them in a bowl, add the lemon zest and juice, thyme leaves, 1 tablespoon of the oil, a good pinch of salt and lots of pepper. Turn the chicken in the marinade and leave to marinate covered in the fridge for 5 minutes.Heat a large griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Put the chicken on the hot griddle and cook for 5–6 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Toss the courgette, pepper and tomatoes in a clean bowl with the remaining oil and season with salt and pepper.Transfer the chicken to plate and leave to rest. Add the vegetables to the griddle and cook for 2–3 minutes on each side, or until lightly charred and softened. Return to the mixing bowl, add the pesto and rocket and toss lightly. Divide between two plates.Slice the chicken thickly and place on top. Drizzle with the resting juices and an extra dribble of olive oil if you like.
