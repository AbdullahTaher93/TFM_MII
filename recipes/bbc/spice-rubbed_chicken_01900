For the chicken thighs, combine the spices, ginger, garlic, chilli and oil in a small bowl. Rub the marinade into the chicken thighs and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 1 hour.Heat a griddle pan and once hot, add the thighs. Grill for about 4 minutes on each side, or until the thighs are crispy and a deep golden colour. Check that the chicken is cooked through (the juices will run clear when the chicken is pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.) Leave to rest for a further 10 minutes under a cloth.For the channa roti, sift the flours and salt into a large bowl. Pour in the oil and yoghurt or water to make a soft, but not sticky, dough. Add a little more flour or water if needed. Add the coriander, chilli and seeds. Knead gently until smooth and all the ingredients are evenly distributed. Cover and leave to rest for about 30 minutes.Divide into even-sized portions and roll each one into a thin circle of about a 2mm thickness, using a rolling pin. Spoon the onions into the middle of each roti, fold over and seal around the edges. Heat a little oil in a heavy-based pan. Roll out one of the roti again thinly into a round with a rolling pin and fry on one side until it puffs up and is speckled brown on the underside. Turn it over and fry on the other side for a few minutes, until it too is puffed up and speckled brown. Remove from the pan, allowing the roti to cool for a few seconds, before transferring to a very low oven to keep warm. Cook the remaining roti in the same way.For the coconut sambal, put all the ingredients except for the coconut in a food processor and blitz. Add the coconut and blitz until the coconut has turned evenly red and everything is fully combined. Season with salt and lime juice.Garnish the chicken thighs with the coriander and serve with the roti and coconut sambal.
