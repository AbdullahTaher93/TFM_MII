For the kulfi, place the milk, cream, condensed milk, powdered milk, sugar and nutmeg into a non-stick pan and rapidly bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.Meanwhile, place the guavas into a blender with the water and blend to make a purée. Push the puree through a sieve with the back of a spoon and discard the seeds. You should be left with 500ml/½ litre of purée.Add the guava purée to the milk mixture and stir well.Spoon the mixture into six individual kulfi moulds, jelly moulds or yoghurt pots and freeze overnight.Just before serving the kulfi, prepare the fruit salad. Place the prepared fruit into a bowl with the passion fruit pulp and seeds, lime juice and zest and sugar and stir to coat the fruit.To serve, turn the kulfi out of their moulds onto serving plates and serve with the fruit salad.
