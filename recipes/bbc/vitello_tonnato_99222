Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.For the veal, heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan. Once hot, add the garlic, thyme and bay leaves and cook for 1 minute. Add the rump and seal on all sides. Roast in the oven for 40â€“50 minutes, or until cooked to your liking. Leave to rest on a board or plate.Place the frying pan back on the heat and deglaze the pan with the Madeira.For the sauce, place the capers, parsley, anchovies, eggs and tuna in a food processor and blitz until smooth. Slowly pour in the olive oil with the motor running and add enough to create a thick sauce. Add the lemon juice and season with the pepper.To serve, slice the veal as thinly as possible with a very sharp knife. Spoon the sauce generously on the bottom of the serving plate and layer over the sliced meat. Drizzle with olive oil and some of the Madeira juices. Scatter over the caperberries and parsley.
