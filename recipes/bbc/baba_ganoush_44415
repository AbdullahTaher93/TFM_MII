Prick the aubergines with a fork. Grill the aubergines until the skin is charred and blacked and the flesh feels soft when you press it (this will take approximately 15-20 minutes, turning halfway through cooking).In a pestle and mortar, crush the garlic with the lemon juice, tahini, olive oil and pepper.When cool enough to handle, cut the aubergines in half and scoop out the flesh. Mix the soft flesh with the remaining ingredients.Place in a serving dish and finish with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle the parsley over the top.
