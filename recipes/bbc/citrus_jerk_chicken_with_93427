To make the citrus jerk chicken, place all the ingredients, except the chicken pieces, into a large bowl and mix well. Place the chicken pieces into the marinade and cover with cling film. Leave to marinate in the fridge for at least an hour, preferably overnight.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Transfer the chicken to a large baking tray and sit skin-side up. Roast the chicken in the middle of the oven for around 30–40 minutes; check it after 15–20 minutes and turn the pieces to make sure it’s cooking evenly. When the chicken is golden, and the juices are running clear, it is cooked. Drizzle the honey over the chicken pieces and roast for a further 10 minutes.To make the cornmeal waffles, preheat a waffle maker and mix the baking powder and vinegar to a smooth paste.Whisk the flour, cornmeal, sugar, eggs and milk together in a bowl and stir in the vinegar and baking powder mixture. Pour the mix into the hot waffle maker and cook for around 6 minutes, or until golden-brown. Alternatively, heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan over a medium heat, add a splash of oil and fry the batter in batches, like pancakes.To serve, divide the chicken between four plates and serve a waffle with each. Garnish with some lamb’s lettuce and orange segments.
