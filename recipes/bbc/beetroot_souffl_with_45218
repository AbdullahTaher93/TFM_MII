Add the egg yolks to the mixture one at a time and blend until everything is smooth. Pour the mixture from the blender into a large bowl.Whisk the egg whites until stiff in a clean bowl and then carefully fold into the beetroot mixture.Place the prepared ramekins onto a baking tray, pour in the soufflé mixture and bake in the oven for 20 – 25 minutes.For the anchovy sauce, put the butter and garlic into a pan, fry for one minute then discard the garlic.
