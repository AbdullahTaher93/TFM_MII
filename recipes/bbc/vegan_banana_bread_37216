Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line the base and sides of a 900g/2lb loaf tin with baking parchment.Put the mashed bananas in a large bowl and add the sugar, flour, sultanas, pecan nuts (if using), mixed spice and baking powder.Mix lightly with a wooden spoon until roughly combined, then add the oil and beat together well.Spoon the cake batter into the prepared tin and smooth the surface. Bake for 55â€“60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out a little moist, but clean.Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then carefully turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool for around an hour before serving.
