Add a tablespoon of water and heat gently until melted.Remove from the heat and mix in the eggs and flour.Spoon into the cake tin and bake for 40-45 minutes until the cake is springy to the touch and shrinking slightly from the sides of the tin.Cool slightly in the tin before turning out onto a wire rack.While the cake is still warm, make the icing by mixing the sugar and honey together with 2-3 teaspoons of hot water. Trickle over the cake in whatever design takes your fancy.
