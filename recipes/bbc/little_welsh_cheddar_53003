Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease four individual tartlet tins with butter and dust lightly with flour.For the pastry, place the butter, flour, salt and 50ml/1¾fl oz water into a food processor. Process for 20 seconds, or until a dough comes together (take care not to over process the dough as it will make the pastry tough). Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a sausage shape. If time allows, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 5mm/¼in. Line the prepared tartlet tins with the pastry. Prick each pastry base with a fork, add baking beans and blind bake for approximately 10 minutes.For the filling, place the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Sauté the leek and garlic in the pan for 5 minutes, or until softened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the leek and garlic into the pastry cases and top each evenly with the Cheddar. Return to the oven for approximately 5–8 minutes, or until browned.Serve the tartlets immediately with a side salad and chutney.
