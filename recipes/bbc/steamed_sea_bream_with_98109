To make the scallop mousse, blitz the scallops with the egg white and salt in a food processor. Gradually add the cream and lime juice whilst the processor is on. Turn it off, stir in the chives and pour into a piping bag. Refrigerate.To make the ceviche, mix the scallops, courgette, shallot, lime juice, olive oil and pink peppercorns in a bowl. Season with salt and set aside for 10 minutes.Season the sea bream and pipe the scallop mousse on top of the fillets, spreading evenly. Sandwich the two fillets together, so the mousse is in the middle, and wrap firmly in cling film.Steam the fish for 10–15 minutes in a steamer, until just cooked.In the meantime, heat the olive oil in frying pan and sauté the spinach, until wilted.To serve, put the spinach on two plates, unwrap the fish and rest on top and spoon over the ceviche.
