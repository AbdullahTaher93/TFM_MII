Cut baking paper into circles the size of the opening on the jam jars. Put a saucer in the freezer.Place all the ingredients in a pan with 150ml/5fl oz water and simmer until the rhubarb starts to soften.Increase the heat and boil rapidly for 8-10 minutes before testing to see if set.To test whether the jam has set: take the saucer from the freezer and drop a small spoonful of jam on to it. Allow it to cool for a minute then push your finger through the jam – if it wrinkles it’s ready; if not, boil for a few more minutes. Continue testing until the jam is ready. (Always remove the jam from the heat while you’re testing so that if it’s ready you won’t overcook it.)Remove the vanilla pod.Pour the hot jam into sterilised jam jars and cover the jam with the paper circles. Screw on the lids and set aside to cool completely.
