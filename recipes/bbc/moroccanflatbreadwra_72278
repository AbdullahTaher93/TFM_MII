To make the flatbread, mix the dry ingredients together and add water until a firm dough has formed.Divide the dough into six and roll out the flatbreads thinly.Cook in a very hot, dry, non-stick pan for one minute on each side or until brown spots appear on both sides.Now make the filling. Place the garlic, cumin, thyme, and a tablespoon of the olive oil in a bowl and coat the lamb steak well.  Leave this to marinate for one hour.Meanwhile, brush the courgettes and aubergines with olive oil. Griddle on a hot griddle pan until the vegetables are softened and golden-brown. Set aside.Next, place the lamb steak on the hot griddle and cook for a few minutes either side.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly, then slice thinly.Mix the grilled vegetables, roasted pepper and sun-dried tomatoes in another bowl with the olives and pour the remaining olive oil and the lemon juice over them.Now make the harissa.  With a hand blender, whiz up the chillies, garlic and coriander with the lemon juice and enough olive oil to make a mayonnaise consistency. Season to taste.Lay two flatbreads on a plate and add a couple of spoons of the roasted vegetables to each. Add the sliced lamb, then some rocket, and then a spoon of harissa dressing. Repeat with the remaining flatbreads.Roll up the flatbreads and cut in half. Serve the halves around a pile of rocket drizzled with the harissa dressing.
