Add the cumin, turmeric and cinnamon and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant.Add the onion and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until softened but not coloured, stirring well to coat it in the spices. Stir in the garlic and aduki beans and continue to fry for 2-3 minutes, squashing the beans with the back of a wooden spoon so that any excess moisture is released and evaporates.Turn off the heat, then gently fold in the remaining aduki ball ingredients until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.Roll 1Â½ tablespoonful portions of the mixture into balls and place the balls on the prepared baking tray. Melt coconut oil and baste the aduki balls all over with it. Bake for 12-15 minutes, turning halfway through cooking, until crisp on the outside and heated through. Remove from the oven and keep warm.Remove the roasted vegetables from the oven and stir.

Blend until smooth using a hand-held blender. Add a dash more water if necessary to loosen the gravy.
