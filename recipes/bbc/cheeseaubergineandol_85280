Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and aubergine and gently fry for two minutes. Add the kidney beans, tomatoes and olives and cook for three minutes.Lay a tortilla wrap out flat, fill with the kidney bean mix and roll up. Sprinkle with grated cheese and use a mini-blowtorch to "grill" the cheese until it has melted. (Alternatively, place the wrapped tortilla on a baking tray and place under a perheated grill, until the cheese has melted. Serve.
