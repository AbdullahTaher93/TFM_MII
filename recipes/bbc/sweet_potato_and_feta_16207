Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with baking paper.Remove the filo from the fridge and set aside to come to room temperature while you prepare the filling.Put the sweet potato, red onion, garlic, cannellini beans, salad cheese, mint, salt and pepper into a large bowl. Mix well.Cut the filo in half so you have a pile of square pieces. Lay a sheet of filo pastry on a board. Brush with little oil, then layer another sheet on top at a 45 degree angle â€“ you want to create a star shape. Repeat with the remaining pastry and oil until you have 6 star-shaped stacks.Divide the filling between the filo stars, placing it right in the centre. Gently pull the sides of the stars up over the filling to meet in the middle. Gently squeeze together above the filling to create a parcel, a bit like a little purse then loosen the centre slightly so that you have floppy folding out edges.Transfer the parcels to the baking tray, brush with any remaining oil and bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly for 5 minutes before serving.Meanwhile, make the salad. Put the peppers on a separate baking tray and drizzle with the oil. Roast for 20 minutes until just browned and softened.Toss the lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber and pine nuts in a bowl.Put the vinegar, mustard, honey, orange juice, oil, salt and pepper into a small jar or bowl and shake or whisk together. Drizzle half of the dressing over the salad and toss well. Put the rest of the dressing into a sealed container to use on other salads. It will keep in the fridge for 5 days.Divide the parcels between six serving plates. Stir the peppers into the salad and serve alongside the parcels.
