Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.Place the pumpkin or butternut squash in a large roasting tray and roast for 30–45 minutes, until soft. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.Meanwhile, pour the milk into a glass and add the lemon juice. Set aside to sour for 15 minutes.When the squash is cool enough to handle, remove the skin, place the flesh in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Tip into a large bowl and beat in the eggs and soured milk until completely combined. Fold in the flour and baking powder.Lightly oil a griddle pan, making sure to grease all the grooves, and place over a high heat. When hot, add 1–2 ladles of the mixture into the pan and immediately turn the heat to low. Push the mixture to the edges using a spatula. Cook for 3–4 minutes, or until the top has started to set, then flip the waffle over using a spatula on each side and cook for a further 3–4 minutes. Slide onto a plate and keep warm while you make more waffles to finish the mixture. The mixture should make 2–3 more, depending on the size of your griddle pan.When cooked, cut each waffle into 2–4 pieces, depending on their size, and divide between plates. Place a dollop of yoghurt on each, sprinkle with cinnamon, drizzle liberally with maple syrup and serve.
