Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease a large baking mould.In a small bowl resting over a saucepan of hot water, melt the chocolate and butter together (the bowl should not be touching the water).In a separate bowl whisk the egg yolks with the icing sugar until pale and creamy.Fold the melted chocolate into the egg mixture.Using a clean whisk, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form, then fold gradually into the chocolate mixture.Using a spatula pour the mixture into the greased mould, then bake in the oven for approximately 30 minutes, until slightly cracked on the top, but still gooey in the middle. Serve.
