Heat the oil in a wide-based shallow saucepan. Add the onion and garlic and fry for a few minutes over a high heat.Stir in the rice to coat the grains. Pour in the wine and boil for a few minutes until nearly evaporated. Toss in the sliced asparagus stalks and add the hot stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring over the high heat, until all the stock has been absorbed, and the rice is just tender. Make sure that each spoonful of stock is absorbed before adding the next. From when the first ladle of stock is added, it should take around 20 minutes to cook.Add the mushrooms and the asparagus tips and stir for about 3 minutes until well combined with the rice and just softened.Remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan, chives and butter and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir and cover with a lid, then leave to stand for 2 minutes before serving.
