For the fried squid and courgette, pour the vegetable oil into a frying pan to a depth of 1cm/Â½in and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Place the flour into a bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper and stir. Dip the squid rings into the seasoned flour to coat, shaking off any excess, and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat the process with the courgette pieces.For the tapenade, place the sun-dried tomatoes, olives and oil into a small food processor, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend until smooth.To serve, place the fried squid rings and courgette onto a plate with a small bowl of tapenade.
