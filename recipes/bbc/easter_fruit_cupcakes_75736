Stir in the flour and baking powder evenly.Three-quarter fill each muffin paper with spoonfuls of the mixture and bake for about 25 minutes, or until a skewer poked in comes out almost clean.Make the syrup by boiling the sugar with the water in a small pan until dissolved, then leave to liquid to cool.
