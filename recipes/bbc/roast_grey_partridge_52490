Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Stuff a thyme sprig into each partridge, then wrap three slices of pancetta around it and tie in place using kitchen string. Heat a tablespoon of the oil in a large, heavy-based ovenproof pan and fry the partridges until lightly golden all over.Turn the partridges breast-down and transfer the pan to the oven to roast for 6 minutes.Turn the birds over and add the port to the pan, then roast for a further 5–6 minutes, or until the partridges are done – pull a leg away slightly from the breast to see if the meat looks cooked. The juices should run clear if a skewer is inserted into the thickest part of the meat. When the birds are cooked, remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 5 minutes.While the partridges are roasting, blanch the Savoy cabbage in a saucepan of boiling salted water for about 7 minutes, or until tender. Drain well.Heat the remaining oil in a pan and briefly fry the garlic. Add the chopped vegetables and chestnuts and cook for 4–5 minutes, or until softened. Add the cabbage and stock. Bring to a simmer, then cook over a low heat, stirring frequently, for 10–15 minutes, or until the stock has reduced and the cabbage becomes slightly caramelised. Season with salt and pepperTo serve, spoon the cabbage onto warmed plates, set the partridges on top and drizzle over the roasting juices.
