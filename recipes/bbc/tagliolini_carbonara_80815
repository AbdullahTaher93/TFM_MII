To make the pasta, put the flours in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the whole eggs and yolks and keep blending until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. (It shouldn't be dusty, nor should it be a big, gooey ball.) This takes 2–3 minutes.Tip out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and form into a ball. Knead it briskly for 1 minute. (It should be quite stiff and hard to work with.) Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in a cool place for 30 minutes.Dust the surface, the pasta and the rolling pin with flour to prevent it sticking. Flatten the dough with the palm of your hand, then roll the pasta out using a heavy wooden rolling pin. (A pasta machine could also be used.) You can do this in two halves, covering the remaining half in cling film to stop it drying out.When the dough is thin enough to see your fingers through it, cut into long 2–3mm wide strips.Separate into individual pieces and toss with dried semolina or a little more flour to prevent the pasta sticking to itself. Cook in boiling salted water for 3–5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the pasta.To make the salad, mix together the tomatoes, basil and mozzarella in a bowl. Mix together the olive oil and vinegar in a separate bowl, season with salt and pepper and add to the tomatoes.To make the carbonara, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and cook the pork cheek until golden. Turn off the heat. Mix the eggs and cheese in a bowl.Drain the fresh pasta and add to the pan with the egg and cheese mixture and toss together well. The heat from the spaghetti will be sufficient to partly cook the egg, but still leave it moist and creamy.  Season to taste with black pepper and serve.
