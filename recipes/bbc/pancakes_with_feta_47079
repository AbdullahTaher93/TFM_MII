For the pancakes, combine the flour, sugar and salt, then mix in the eggs using a whisk. Add the milk gradually to avoid any lumps.To cook the pancakes, add a smear of melted butter to a non-stick frying pan, using a pastry brush. Ladle in some batter, swirling around to coat the pan - it might take one or two test pancakes before youâ€™ve got the amount of batter just right. Cook each pancake on both sides until golden-brown and then remove to a plate while you cook the next pancake.For the salad, place the cut lettuce into ice-cold water and leave for a couple of minutes. Just before serving, remove from the water and drizzle with olive oil.For the glaze, heat a medium saucepan and add the orange juice and cinnamon stick. Stir in the honey and saffron and cook until reduced to a syrupy glaze.Sprinkle the feta on the pancakes and fold them into quarters. Return the folded pancakes to the frying pan and pour over the glaze. Heat gently for a few minutes.Serve the pancakes with any remaining glaze poured on top. Serve the salad alongside.
