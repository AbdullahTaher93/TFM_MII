To make the filling, toss the meat and kidneys in seasoned flour. Heat the oil in a large casserole dish, add the beef and kidneys and brown all over. Remove to a plate.Add the vegetables to the pan and cook until softened. Add the tomato purée, wine and bay leaf. Bring to the boil and then simmer until reduced.Return the meat to the pan with the bone marrow and pour in the stock and Worcestershire sauce. Simmer for 1½–2 hours. Season with salt and pepper.Meanwhile, mix the lard with the flour and salt and add enough water to form a dough.On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry into a rectangle. Fold the top half towards you into the centre, then fold the bottom half away from you into the centre. Turn the pastry 90 degrees and roll out again. Repeat the steps 6 times, then put in the fridge to chill.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. To assemble, put the filling into a pie dish.Roll out the pastry to a circle just larger than the pie dish and cover. Put the whole marrow bone in the middle so it’s sticking out the dish.Brush with the beaten egg and bake for 30 minutes until golden.
