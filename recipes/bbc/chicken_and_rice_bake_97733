Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Lightly grease a large roasting tray and put in the onion and garlic. Drizzle over the melted butter and give the onions a stir. Bake for 10–15 minutes, making sure they don’t begin to burn. Keep an eye on them – if the edges are catching too quickly, take the tray out and stir the onions again before returning to the oven.Meanwhile, for the chicken, mix the salt, garlic, onion and cayenne in a bowl. Rub the drumsticks with the oil and cover with the spicy rub.Take the onions out of the oven and add the rice and cardamom seeds. Stir well, then put the drumsticks on top. Pour in the stock (or boiling water). Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.Remove from the oven, lift the chicken drumsticks on to a side plate, then add the peas to the rice and lightly stir them through. Replace the chicken pieces and bake without the foil for another 15 minutes.Stir in the chopped coriander and serve.
