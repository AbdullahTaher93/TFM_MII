Before cooking, wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven at 180C/350F/Gas 4. Brush the inside of a 500g loaf tin with a little oil and place it on a baking tray.Place the flour, baking powder and butter into a bowl.  Rub them together using your fingertips (as if you are tickling the mixture) until you get a fine crumbly mixture.Ask a grown-up to help you cut up the apple into small bite-sized pieces. Add these to the bowl with the grated cheese.Now break the egg in the cup and beat it with the fork.  Then add it to the flour mixture.  Add a bit of apple juice to moisten the mixture. It should be a thick batter, so you may not need all the apple juice.Spoon the batter into the loaf tin and sprinkle the top with the extra cheese. Ask a grown-up to put it in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until it is golden brown and has risen well. Serve the loaf with fresh apple chunks.
