For the seabass marinade, blend the lime juice, coriander, parsley, thyme, allspice, Worcestershire sauce, chilli, spring onions and half of the olive oil in a food processor until smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Lay the sea bass fillets into a shallow glass or ceramic dish and pour over the seabass marinade. Cover the dish with cling film and chill in the fridge for 15-20 minutes. (NB: Do not leave the fish any longer or the citric acid from the lime juice will start to 'cook' it.)Meanwhile, for the cou-cou, slice the block of ready-made polenta into four long pieces. Sprinkle the flour onto a plate and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Dredge the blocks of polenta in the seasoned flour until they are completely covered.Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over a medium to high heat. Add the blocks of polenta and sprinkle over the thyme leaves. Fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pale golden-brown on all sides.Heat the butter in a separate frying pan over a medium heat. Add the okra, onion, garlic, the remaining thyme and the salt and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.Heat the remaining vegetable oil for the sea bass in a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Shake the sea bass fillets to remove any excess marinade, then add them to the pan, skin-side down, and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until crisp.Carefully turn the sea bass fillets over and fry for a further 1-2 minutes, or until completely cooked through.For the tomato and lime salsa, heat the vegetable oil in a separate frying pan over a medium heat. Add the tomatoes, spring onions and Scotch bonnet chilli and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened.Pour over the lime juice and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, place one sea bass fillet onto each of four serving plates. Drizzle over the olive oil. Spoon the cou-cou, okra and tomato and lime salsa alongside.
