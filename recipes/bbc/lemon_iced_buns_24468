Cover the bowl with cling film and set aside in a warm place for one hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.Lightly grease two baking trays.Knock the dough back to its original size and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough into eight portions, shape them into rounds and place onto the baking trays. Ensure the rolls are well spaced.
