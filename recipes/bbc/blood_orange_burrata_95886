For the dressing, heat the anchovies with the garlic in the milk until soft and the anchovies have dissolved. Add the cream, butter and oil. Bring to a simmer and then blend using a hand-blender to make a smooth, thickish paste. Cool before serving.For the salad, juice one of the blood oranges and pour into a saucepan. Simmer until the juice has reduced in volume by half. Peel and segment the other blood orange.Toss the vegetables, apple and orange segments in a salad bowl with olive oil, vinegar, a splash of the reduced blood orange juice and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Spread the anchovy dressing quite thickly on a large serving plate, put the whole burrata in the middle of the plate, and arrange the veg in a jumble around the outside. Serve.
