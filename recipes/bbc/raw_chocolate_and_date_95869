Grease and line a 20cm/8in square loose-bottomed cake tin with baking paper.Tip the dates, peanuts, ground almonds, porridge oats, 4 tablespoons of the cocoa powder, the vanilla extract and almond milk into a food processor and blend for 2–3 minutes until the mixture starts to come together.Scrape the mixture down, if needed, and blend until nearly smooth – you want a little texture left.Press the mixture into the lined tin with the back of a wet spoon until you have a thick even layer. Leave in the fridge for 30 minutes until firm.Remove the brownie from the tin, cut into 24 pieces and dust with the remaining cocoa powder.Serve straightaway or transfer to a sealable container and keep in the fridge.
