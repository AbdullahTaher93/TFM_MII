Butter the slices of malt loaf and spread with marmalade. Cut into triangles.Grease a 1.2litre/2 pint oven-proof dish with butter. Arrange a layer of malt loaf in the bottom of the dish.Sprinkle over some of the sultanas. Continue to repeat the malt loaf layers and sultanas until they are all used up.In a pan gently heat the milk and cream. Remove from the heat just before it comes to the boil.Whisk the eggs in a bowl with the caster sugar and cinnamon. Gradually add the warm milk and cream and continue whisking until all the milk is incorporated.Pour the custard over the malt loaf and sprinkle the demerara sugar over the top. Leave the pudding to stand for 30 minutes before baking: this allows the bread to absorb the milk.Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the custard has set and the pudding is golden-brown.Leave the pudding to cool slightly.Mix the crème fraîche with the zest of the orange and serve it with the pudding.
