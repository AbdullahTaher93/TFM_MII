Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and grease a deep ovenproof dish with butter.Combine the milk, breadcrumbs and eggs in a large jug, whisk together with a fork and set aside.Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based pan and fry the lamb in batches for 5 minutes, or until browned. Transfer to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Add the onions and bay leaf to the pan and fry for 10 minutes, or until the onions are golden-brown.Add the garlic to the pan, fry for a minute and then stir in the curry paste. Fry the paste for a minute, then return the lamb to the pan and stir to coat. Pour over the stock, bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated.Take the pan off the heat and stir in the remaining ingredients. Spoon the lamb mixture into the buttered dish in an even layer and smooth down with the back of a spoon.Pour the milk mixture over the top, then bake for 35 minutes, or until golden-brown on top â€“ the topping should be just set, with a slight wobble. Leave to stand for a few minutes before serving.
