Wrap the boned rabbit loin in the bacon. Fry in a hot pan for 3 minutes on each side, or more depending on how well you like your rabbit cooked. Set aside.Add a dash of oil to the pan, if needed, then fry the rack of rabbit for 3 minutes on each side, or more depending on how well you like your rabbit cooked. Set to one side to rest.For the risotto, heat the stock in a saucepan and add the star anise and lemongrass. Simmer for a few minutes.In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the butter and oil. Add the shallot and cook until just translucent, then add the squid and garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir for 2 minutes.Add a couple of ladles of stock and stir until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is scraped from the bottom of the pan. It’s important that the stock and rice are of a similar temperature, so the heat doesn't drop when you add the stock. This ensures the rice cooks all the way through.Add the squid ink and continue to add the stock in batches, stirring and scraping all the time, to avoid sticking. After 15–20 minutes, the rice will be tender, but still firm to the bite, and the risotto will be creamy and moist.When the risotto is ready, quickly whisk a little butter into it. You are aiming for a soft, creamy, voluminous texture. Add the herbs, season and stir to mix well.For the tempura tarragon, mix the soda water with 150g/5oz cornflour and a pinch of salt to make a batter.Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in 1 minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Pick the tarragon into branches and coat in the remaining cornflour, then dip into the batter and deep-fry for 2 minutes, until crispy.To serve, pile the risotto onto plates. Divide the rabbit between the plates, sprinkle over the crispy tarragon.
