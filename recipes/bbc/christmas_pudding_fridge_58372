Stir occasionally.Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the broken biscuits, apricots, raisins, pecans and marshmallows.Spoon the mixture into the bowl, pushing down well to minimise air pockets.Leave to cool, then put in the fridge overnight to set.The next day, place the pudding bowl in a dish of hot water for a few seconds to loosen it from the pudding bowl.
