To make the Welsh cakes, mix the flour, 85g/3oz of the caster sugar, the baking powder and crushed fennel seeds together in a bowl. Add the cubed butter and use your fingertips to rub it in until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the blueberries and mix to combine.Make a well in the centre and add the egg. Use a table knife to mix the egg in, then add the milk and bring the dough together with your hands.Dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the dough to 1cm/½in thickness. Cut out rounds using a 4cm/1½in round cutter, then take all the scraps, bring them together and re-roll. Cut out more rounds, and keep doing this until you have used up all the dough. Put the remaining 200g of caster sugar into a bowl.Lightly brush a medium non-stick pan with a little melted butter or spray with oil. Place a batch of Welsh cakes in the pan well spaced out, and cook over a low heat for 3 minutes. Turn them over and cook for another 3 minutes, then take off the heat and immediately dip each Welsh cake into the bowl of sugar. Set aside. Do the same for the remaining Welsh cakes: cook, coat in sugar and set aside.To make the coulis, purée the blueberries in a food processor with the icing sugar and lemon juice until broken down.  Then push through a sieve to remove the seeds. Serve the coulis in a small bowl alongside the Welsh cakes.
