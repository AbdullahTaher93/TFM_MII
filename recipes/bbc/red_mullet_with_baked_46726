Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Put the tomatoes in an ovenproof dish with the beans, garlic, lemon juice and spray with the oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes and beans are tender.Meanwhile, tear off 4 large sheets of foil and line with non-stick baking paper. Place 2 fish fillets on each piece of baking paper, then scatter over the lemon rind, capers and spring onions, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fold over the paper-lined foil and scrunch the edges together to seal. Place the parcels on a large baking tray.Place the fish parcels next to the vegetables in the oven and bake for a further 8-10 minutes, or until the flesh flakes easily when pressed in the centre with a knife.Spoon the vegetables on to four serving plates and top each with two fish fillets. Garnish with the parsley and caperberries and serve.
