For the bread dough, place the flour in a large bowl and add the yeast and salt and mix. Slowly add 150-200ml water until it comes together as a dough. Knead for at least 5 minutes until you have a smooth dough. Place in a lightly floured, large bowl, cover and leave to prove for about an hour or until doubled in size.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Heat a medium frying pan and add the oil, fry the trotter with the cabbage for 2-3 minutes.Knock the air out of the dough, and roll out into a circle on a floured surface.Place all the filling ingredients into one half of the rolled out dough circle, mix them together and then fold the other half over to make a semi-circle. Crimp the edges until well-sealed and place on a baking tray lined with baking paper.Bake in the oven for 15â€“20 minutes or until golden-brown. When you tap the bottom it should sound hollow.To serve, place the cooked bread onto a serving plate and tear open.
