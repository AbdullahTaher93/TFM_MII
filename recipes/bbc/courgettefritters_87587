Season the courgette with sea salt and set aside.Whisk together the egg, baking powder, flour and cumin in a large bowl and season with black pepper.Squeeze the excess water out of the courgette over the sink, then add the courgette and peas to the batter.Heat enough oil to just cover the bottom of a large frying pan, over a medium-high heat. When the oil just shimmers, drop in heaped tablespoons of the courgette mixture, flattening them with the back of the spoon to make fritters. Fry each one for 1â€“2 minutes, or until golden-brown on each side. If you need to cook in batches in a smaller pan, set the fritters to drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.To make the dip, stir together the yoghurt and mango chutney in a small bowl.Serve the fritters with the yoghurt.
