Mix well, cover the bowl with a tea towel and leave in a cool place for 24 hours, then rinse the vegetables in ice-cold water and drain thoroughly.Blend the cornflour, turmeric, mustard powder, mustard seeds, cumin and coriander to a smooth paste with a little of the vinegar. Put the rest of the vinegar into a saucepan with the sugar and honey and bring to the boil.Pour a little of the hot vinegar over the blended spice paste, stir well then transfer to the pan containing the remaining vinegar.
