Sprinkle over the brown sugar. Turn the heat up high for a couple of minutes, turning the meat so it browns well.Drain the sauerkraut well and give it a rinse if you want to reduce the vinegar flavour. The easiest thing to do is squeeze it out with your hands. Add to the casserole with the white cabbage and chopped tomatoes, then pour over the stock.
