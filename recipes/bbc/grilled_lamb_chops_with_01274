For the jam, heat the chopped chillies, water, sugar, mirin and lime juice in a saucepan until boiling.Cook, stirring continuously, for 6-8 minutes then remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool - the jam will thicken as it cools.For the salad, preheat the grill to medium high. Place the lamb belly onto a heavy grill tray and place under the grill for 7-8 minutes, turning half way through, then remove from the grill and rest for five minutes.Place the lime juice, garlic, ginger, palm sugar, fish sauce and the chopped red chillies into a pestle and mortar or food processor and blend until combined.Place the sliced chilli, mizuna, mint leaves, coconut and cucumber into a bowl and gently mix to combine.Slice the lamb belly into fine strips then mix into the salad. Add the dressing to the salad and mix once more.To cook the chops, heat a griddle pan until very hot. Brush the chops with a little oil then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Place the chops on the griddle and cook on each side for 2-3 minutes until cooked but still pink then remove and rest for two minutes on a warm plate.Place three lamb chops onto each serving plate, spoon the chilli jam alongside and pile the salad beside the lamb chops.
