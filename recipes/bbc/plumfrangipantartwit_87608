Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Grease six 10cm/4in fluted tart cases.For the tarts, lightly flour the work surface and divide the pastry into six.  Roll each piece of pastry out so that it is 2cm-3cm/1in-1Â½in bigger than the tart cases.Place the pastry into the tart cases and push into the edges. Leave the excess pastry hanging over the top of each tin.Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper into each case and fill with baking beans or rice. Place on a tray and bake in the oven for 15 minutes until just golden.After 15 minutes, take the pastry out of the oven and remove the greaseproof paper and beans. Then return to the oven for another five minutes.Remove the pastry cases from the oven and trim the excess from the top of each tart to give a clean edge. Set them to one side.For the frangipane, place the butter and 150g/6oz of  icing sugar into a bowl and beat until light and softened.  Add the ground almonds, flour and cinnamon and stir until combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating carefully.Add the rum and stir to make a smooth thick batter. Spoon the frangipane mixture into the pastry cases and place the plum wedges in a circle on top of the batter.
