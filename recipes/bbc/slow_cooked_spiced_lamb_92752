Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3. Put all the sauce ingredients into a food processor and blitz until smooth.To make the lamb shanks, heat the oil in a large heavy-based casserole dish with a tight-fitting lid over a medium heat. Add the lamb shanks and brown all over.Pour the sauce over the lamb and add the stock. Bring to the boil, then cover the pan tightly with foil and place the lid on top. Transfer to the oven and cook for 2½–3 hours, turning the shanks once or twice, until tender. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.Meanwhile, put the potatoes and swede in a large saucepan of salted water and bring to the boil. Cook for 15–20 minutes, or until tender, then drain and mash with the butter and milk. Season well.To serve, dollop some mash onto a large plate, sit a lamb shank on top and spoon over some of the sauce. Scatter over the spring onions and sesame seeds and serve.
