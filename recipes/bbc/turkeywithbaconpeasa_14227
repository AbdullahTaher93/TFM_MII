In a heavy frying pan fry the bacon or pancetta until just crispy. Turn the heat down, then add the onions and garlic and cook gently until soft but not coloured.Add the peas and a splash of water and allow to bubble for a couple of minutes. When the pan is almost dry again add the turkey and heat through.Add the cream and season well with salt and black pepper. Allow to bubble until the cream has reduced a little and the sauce has a nice coating consistency.Serve tossed with the cooked tagliatelle, with plenty of fresh grated Parmesan on the table.
