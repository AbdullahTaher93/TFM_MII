If you are serving the salsa, make it first to allow the flavours to meld and develop while you cook the cheese. Put the oil, vinegar and honey in a bowl and stir until the honey has dissolved. Add the remaining ingredients and season. Set aside.To make the fried cheese, put half the flour on a small plate. Put one of the eggs in a small bowl and beat. Put half the breadcrumbs on a small plate, add half the herbs and season.Dip half the cheese slices in the flour, then dust off any excess. Next dip them in the egg and shake off any excess. Finally, press them into the breadcrumbs and turn them over until coated. Set aside. Repeat with the remaining flour, egg, breadcrumbs and cheese.Pour the oil into a large frying pan until 1cm/½in deep. Add the garlic and fry until it starts to colour, then remove immediately.Fry the cheese in batches – it will not crisp up if you overcrowd the pan – and drain on kitchen paper.Serve the fried cheese with the salsa or drizzled with the honey.
