Heat the oil in a deep heavy-based saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Sift the flour, turmeric and salt into a bowl.Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture. Add the whole egg and the egg yolk and whisk together from the centre outwards to create a paste.Add the milk and olive oil and fold into the flour and egg paste mixture to create a smooth batter.Fold the egg white into the batter.Dip the corned beef slices into the batter mixture and carefully add to the hot oil. Fry for six minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.For the onion marmalade, heat the olive oil in a pan over a medium heat.Add the onions, chillies, cloves and garlic and fry gently for 15-20 minutes, until the onions have softened and caramelised to a deep brown colour.Add the orange juice and zest, sherry vinegar and sugar and bring to the boil.Cook the mixture for 10-12 minutes, or until the mixture is the consistency of jam. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, divide the fritters evenly among four plates and top with a poached egg. Place a spoonful of marmalade alongside.
