Beat in the marmalade then beat in the eggs, one at a time.In a separate bowl, thoroughly combine the semolina, almonds and baking powder. Add to the mixture, along with the orange zest, and fold in. Finally, mix in the orange juice to create a mixture with a soft dropping consistency.Spoon the batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top with the back of a spoon.Bake for 35 minutes, or until the cake is golden-brown. Leave in the tin to cool for five minutes, then remove and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.To make the frosting, beat the butter and cream cheese together. Sift in the icing sugar and beat until smooth. Use a palette knife to spread the frosting on top of the cake. Chill before serving, so the icing sets.
