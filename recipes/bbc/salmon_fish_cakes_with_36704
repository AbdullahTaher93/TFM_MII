Leave in the fridge to chill for 20-30 minutes to firm up.Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Combine the remaining lemon zest with the breadcrumbs, a pinch of salt and pepper and the parsley and pour into a shallow dish. Prepare a plate of the flour and a shallow dish with the eggs.Coat the fish cakes in flour, shake off any excess and then dip in the beaten eggs. Roll each fishcake in the breadcrumbs until coated on all sides then transfer to a baking tray.Drizzle or spray the fishcakes with a little oil and then bake for 15 minutes, or until golden-brown.While the fish cakes are in the oven, prepare the peas.
