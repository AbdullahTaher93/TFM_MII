For the fishcakes, place all of the fishcake ingredients, except the flour and sesame oil, into a food processor and blend to a coarse paste. Remove the fishcake mixture from the blender and divide and shape into four fishcakes of equal size and dust with flour.Heat the sesame oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the fishcakes and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden-brown and cooked through.For the salad, heat the vegetable oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Carefully add the rice noodles into the hot oil and fry until crisp and golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen paper.Place the mangetout, chilli, garlic, mint and coriander into a bowl and mix well.To serve, divide the salad between two plates. Place a handful of crisp noodles on top of each and add two fishcakes to each.
