To make the broth, put the duck carcasses, onion, leek, celery, roughly chopped carrots and bay leaves in a very large saucepan and pour over cold water until the carcasses are just covered. Bring to the boil, skim any scum that naturally comes to the surface and lower the temperature. Simmer gently for 2 hours, or until the liquid has reduced by half and the stock is rich and fragrant.Remove the carcasses from the pan, pick off any meat and set aside, discarding the bones.Strain the broth into a large bowl through a sieve and discard the vegetables. Season the broth well.Skim a tablespoon of the duck fat off the stock and place in a frying pan set over a high heat for about a minute or until the water has evaporated, leaving just the fat. Add the shallots and cook for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the grated carrots and cook over a medium heat until soft and starting to caramelise. Tip the fried vegetables into the broth and stir well.To serve, put a little of the reserved meat in the bottom of each bowl, pour over the broth and top with the remaining ingredients.
