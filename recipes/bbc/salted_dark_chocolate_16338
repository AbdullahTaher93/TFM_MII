Grease and line two 20cm/8in round cake tins with baking paper.Place the flour, cocoa, sugar, eggs, milk, butter, melted dark chocolate and vanilla in a large bowl and whisk until smooth.Evenly divide the mixture between the tins and bake for 35â€“40 minutes, or until cooked through and a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. Leave to cool slightly in the tins before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.Place the soured cream and melted milk chocolate in a large bowl. Stir to combine and refrigerate for 10 minutes, or until the ganache is a firm, spreadable consistency.Place one of the cakes on a cake stand or plate and trim the top so it is flat.
