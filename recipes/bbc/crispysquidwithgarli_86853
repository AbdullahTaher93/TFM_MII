For the crispy squid, mix the cornflour, semolina or polenta and paprika in a bowl.Dip the squid rings and tentacles into the mixture, a few at a time, to coat completely.Heat the oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) When the oil is hot enough, fry the squid in batches for 1-2 minutes, flipping them once, until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.Meanwhile, for the garlic mayonnaise, stir the crushed garlic into the mayonnaise.To serve, place the crispy squid onto a serving plate with the mayonnaise in a small bowl alongside.
