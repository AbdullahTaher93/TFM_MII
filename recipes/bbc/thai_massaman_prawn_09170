To make the curry paste, in a small, dry frying pan toast the cardamom, cumin seeds, cloves and star anise. Tip into a small blender or spice grinder, or pestle and mortar, and work to a powder. Add all the other ingredients along with 2 tablespoons water and blend to a paste. Set aside.For the curry, heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the onions for a few minutes until soft and golden-brown. Add half the curry paste and cook for a minute or so. Add the potatoes, slashed birdâ€™s-eye chillies, stock, coconut milk, chopped tomatoes, lime leaves, palm sugar, soy sauce and fish sauce. Simmer for about 15 minutes until the potatoes are tender and the wonderful flavours have developed.Add the prawns and cook for a couple of minutes until cooked just through.Check the seasoning, add a little more fish sauce if necessary, and stir in the lime juice and basil, keeping a few leaves back for garnish. Add half the chopped peanuts.To serve, spoon into bowls and garnish with the reserved basil, peanuts and top it off with the red chilli. Serve with some steamed sticky rice.
