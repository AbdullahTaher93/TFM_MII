Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.For the pastry, use a pizza cutter to cut the pastry into 24 x 5cm/2in squares. Brush one side of all the squares lightly with melted butter. Place one square on top of another at an angle, buttered-side-up, to make a star shape, then push into a hole of a mini muffin tray buttered-side down. Repeat until all the squares are used up.Bake for 6–8 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from tin and leave to cool on a wire rack.Meanwhile, for the prawn filling, heat the sesame oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add the garlic, spring onions and ginger, and mix. Add the carrot and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the prawns and stir-fry until they turn pink. Stir in the Chinese five-spice.Add the mangetout, pak choi and beansprouts and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes, or until all the vegetables are just tender. Stir in the soy sauce, then remove from the heat.To assemble the tarts, place the tartlets on the serving board and spoon the prawn filling into the pastry cases. Garnish with fresh coriander.
