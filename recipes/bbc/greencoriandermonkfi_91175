For the monkfish, cut the monkfish tails into 2cm/1in thick slices and place in a bowl.Combine the ginger, garlic, salt and lemon juice in a food processor and blend to a paste.Add the paste to the monkfish and mix well. Set aside to marinate for up to 30 minutes.Meanwhile, blend the coriander root and green chillies in the processor to make a coarse purée.Heat a wok, then add the vegetable oil and marinated monkfish and stir fry for 1-2 minutes.Add the puréed coriander and chilli, and fry for a further minute. Add the tomatoes and bring to the boil, before immediately reducing the heat to a simmer.Simmer for 2-3 minutes, then add the yoghurt and cook for a further two minutes, or until thickened slightly. Taste to check the seasoning and add salt and freshly ground black pepper as necessary. Add half of the chopped coriander.For the poppadoms, heat a small frying pan until hot and fill with 3cm/1½in vegetable oil - keep on a low heat until you're ready to cook the poppadoms. Do not leave unattended.Mix the gram flour and coriander seeds in a bowl. Add the water and stir to form a stiff dough.Remove a walnut-sized ball of the dough from the bowl and roll out on a clean surface to make a thin circle no larger than the frying pan.Adjust the heat until the oil is medium hot (the surface should shimmer slightly). Cook the poppadoms, one at a time, for 30-45 seconds on each side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining dough.To serve, spoon the coriander monkfish among four bowls, top with the remaining coriander and pile the poppadoms alongside.
