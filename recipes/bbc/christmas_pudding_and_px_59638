For the trifle, break up the pudding into the bottom of a large serving dish or individual serving glasses. Top with the quartered figs and splash over the sherry.For the custard, heat the milk, cream and vanilla in a saucepan until just boiling. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool a little. In a bowl, whisk together the yolks, cornflour and sugar and then pour the warm milk mixture over (if the milk is too hot the eggs will scramble). Tip back into the pan and whisk over a low heat until thickened. Remove from the heat and strain. Cover the surface of the custard with baking paper to prevent a skin forming and set aside to cool.Beat the mascarpone and double cream with the icing sugar, to taste.Spoon the cooled custard over the soaked pudding and then top with the mascarpone cream. Decorate with crumbled pecans, almonds, cinnamon and chocolate shavings. Chill until ready to serve.
