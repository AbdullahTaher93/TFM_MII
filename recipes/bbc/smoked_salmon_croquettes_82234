Infuse the milk with the bay leaves, lemon rind and dill by bringing all the ingredients to a simmer in a pan, then removing from the heat and leaving to infuse for 20 minutes or longer. Strain the milk.Heat the butter in a separate pan, tip in the flour and cook for a minute over a low heat. Gradually add the infused milk. Whisk until thick and then boil for a few minutes after all the milk has been used. Remove from the heat and cool for at least 10 minutes before stirring in the smoked salmon.Pour the mixture into a flat tray to cool and firm up. Put the eggs into a shallow dish, and put the breadcrumbs on a plate.Spoon out the mixture from the tray and form into small croquettes. Dip them first in the egg and then coat them in the crumbs. Leave to chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.Preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Fry the croquettes in batches for 4-6 minutes each, removing them carefully from the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Serve hot.
