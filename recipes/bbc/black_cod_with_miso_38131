To make the saikyo miso, put the sake, mirin, miso paste and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil over a high heat. Cook for a few minutes, until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool to room temperature.Put the cod in a bowl and cover with the saikyo miso (reserving a little to garnish). Cover and leave to marinate at room temperature for 2–3 hours.When you're ready to cook the cod, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Heat an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Lift the fish fillets out of the marinade and cook them skin side-down in the pan for 2 minutes. Turn the fish over and roast in the oven for 6–8 minutes, or until cooked through and blackened.Meanwhile, for the sesame spinach, bring the dashi stock to the boil in a large saucepan and add the soy sauce and sugar. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the spinach, stir and turn off the heat. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan until golden, then crush using a mortar and pestle. Drain the spinach, reserving the liquid, and squeeze out any excess moisture. Mix the spinach with almost all the toasted seeds and a little of the cooking liquor.To serve, gather the spinach into a ball and top with the remaining sesame seeds. Serve with the cod and hajikami, with a few drops of the reserved saikyo miso on each plate.
