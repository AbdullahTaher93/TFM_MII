Place the dried haricot beans, onions and tomatoes into a slow cooker.In a spouted bowl, mix together all of the remaining ingredients until well combined. Pour the mixture into the slow-cooker and stir to coat the beans and vegetables as evenly as possible.Pour over 500ml/18fl oz cold water, place the lid on the slow-cooker, then cook on a high heat for 7-8 hours, or until the beans have absorbed the liquid and plumped up and the sauce has darkened and thickened.Serve with toast, ribs or a full English breakfast.
