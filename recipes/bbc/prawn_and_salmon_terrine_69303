Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Wrap the salmon in foil and put it on a baking tray. Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until just cooked.Meanwhile, line a narrow 450g/1lb loaf tin with cling film, making sure plenty is overhanging. Line the sides of the tin with the smoked salmon – the easiest way to do this is across, making sure you leave enough hanging over the sides to cover the top.Flake the cooked salmon and finely chop the cooked prawns. Put them in a bowl and add the lime juice and zest. Season with salt and pepper.In a second bowl, lightly whip the double cream until it is just approaching the stage when soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl.Heat the single cream in a saucepan. Squeeze out the gelatine when it is soft and add it to the single cream. Stir until the gelatine has dissolved.Fold the double cream through the prawns and salmon, then pour in the single cream and gelatine mixture, preferably through a sieve. Add the herbs and mix well. Season if necessary.Spoon the mixture into the smoked salmon-lined terrine and smooth over. Fold over the overhanging pieces of smoked salmon followed by the cling film. Transfer to the fridge and leave for several hours to set and chill.To make the dill sauce, sprinkle the cucumber with salt and leave to stand for 30 minutes in a colander – this will help get rid of some of the excess liquid. Squeeze out the water.Put the yoghurt in a bowl and add the vinegar and lime juice. Stir in the cucumber and dill, then taste. Cover and chill in the fridge.Remove the terrine from the dish and peel off the cling film. Slice the terrine and serve on a plate with the dill sauce.
