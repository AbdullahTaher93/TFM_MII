Put all the cannoli ingredients into a food processor with 185ml/6fl oz water and blend until a dough is formed. Shape the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film and put in the fridge to rest for 1 hour.Meanwhile, to make the candied walnuts, melt the butter and sugar in a pan over a medium heat to make a caramel. Add the walnuts and stir to coat. Pour onto a baking tray lined with baking paper and set aside to harden.Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to about 2mm thick. Cut out 10cm/4 in squares and wrap around metal cylinders, sealing the edges with a little water.Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended. Deep-fry the cannoli with cylinders attached until crisp and golden. Once cooled, carefully remove from the cylinders.To make the filling, beat together all the ingredients until smooth. Spoon into a piping bag (or a sandwich bag with the corner snipped off) and fill the cannoli.Mix together the pear and salad leaves, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Break up the candied walnuts and scatter over the top.Serve the cannolis with the pear salad.
