Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Use 1 teaspoon of the oil to lightly grease the base and sides of a shallow, round, ovenproof dish. Line it with one of the tortillas, making sure it comes up the sides a little, creating a tortilla bowl.Scatter over the ham, crack in the eggs – sprinkling the yolks with a little salt – and then spread about a third of the cheese on top.Brush one side of the second tortilla with oil and place oiled-side up, loosely on top of the filling. Press the edges of the tortillas together, pushing them down into the dish and up the sides, then brush these edges with a little more oil.Top with the remaining cheese, then add a few squeezes or shakes of hot sauce, depending on how fiery you want this to be. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes, by which time the eggs will be cooked inside, the cheese melted, and the edges of the tortilla crust crisped and browned. Ovens do vary, so you may find you need to alter the cooking time. Eat immediately. This is not a huge problem.
