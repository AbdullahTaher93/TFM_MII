To make the pastry, cream the butter and sugar together in a food processor and add the egg yolks, one at a time with the motor on. Add the vanilla seeds and flour and blend until the pastry forms a ball.Wrap the pastry in cling film and leave to chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Divide the pastry into six portions and press into the base and sides of 6 x 9cm/3½in loose-based fluted flan tins. Let the pastry rise around 5mm/¼in above the edge and make sure that the base doesn’t get too thick. Pinch off the excess pastry. Line with crumpled baking parchment and fill with baking beans.Place the tins on a baking tray and bake blind for 15 minutes, then remove the beans and paper and bake for a further 10–15 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp, lightly browned and cooked through. Leave the pastry cases to cool in the tins for 20–30 minutes and then, when cool enough to handle, remove from the tins and place on a small tray.For the orange filling, mix the cream, liqueur and icing sugar until smooth. Colour the mixture pale orange with a few drops of the food colouring. Spoon into the pastry bases and spread to the sides.For the chocolate filling, heat the double cream and both chocolates in a bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, stirring occasionally until the chocolate melts. Remove the bowl from the pan and stir in the cream cheese until smooth. Spoon very gently over the orange icing and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour.To make the topping, put the chocolate, cream and butter in a small non-stick saucepan and heat very gently until melted, glossy and smooth. Transfer into a heatproof bowl, leave to cool for 30 minutes, then spoon over the soft cheese filling and spread to the sides.Leave to set in the fridge for 1 hour. Leave at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving.
