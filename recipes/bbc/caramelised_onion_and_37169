Grease 4 x 10cm/4in loose-bottomed tartlet tins with a little butter.Rub the butter and lard into the flour in a large bowl until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add 2–3 tablespoons of cold water and use your hands to bring it into a rough dough (do not kneed). Split the pastry into 4 pieces and roll each quarter into a circle slightly larger than the tin. Carefully line the tins with the pastry. Refrigerate for 10–20 minutes or until needed.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Put the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the onions. Cook for 10 minutes.  Add the sugar, vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook on a low heat for 20–30 minutes, until really soft and sticky. Set aside.Meanwhile, line the chilled pastry cases with greaseproof paper and add ceramic baking beans or rice, and bake for 12–15. Remove the paper and beans and bake for a further 5 minutes, until lightly golden. Set aside to cool slightly.Reduce the oven temperature to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.Divide the onion and feta between the tins. Mix the eggs and cream together and season well with salt and pepper. Pour the egg equally into each tin and cook in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the egg mixture is cooked and golden-brown.Cool the tartlets in their tins and then remove carefully. Serve.
