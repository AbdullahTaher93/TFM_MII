Put the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the centre and pour in the milk and eggs. Give the liquid mixture a quick whisk before incorporating the flour. Continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter.Now add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and whisk thoroughly.Take a crêpe pan, or large frying pan, dip some kitchen roll in the oil and carefully wipe the inside of the pan. Heat the pan over a medium heat for 1 minute.Add just under a ladleful of batter to the pan and immediately start swirling it round the pan to get a nice even layer.Cook the pancake for 30–40 seconds. Use a palette knife to lift the pancake carefully to look at the underside to check it is golden-brown before turning over. Cook the other side for approx 30– 40 seconds and transfer to a serving plate.
