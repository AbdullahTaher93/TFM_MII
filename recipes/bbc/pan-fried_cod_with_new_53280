To make the sauce, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium–high heat. Add the prawns and fry for 4–5 minutes, turning now and again, until pink and cooked through. Add the onion, carrot, bay leaf and cognac or brandy and bring to the boil, then immediately add the tomatoes, wine, tarragon, fish stock and cream. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat slightly and simmer for 10 minutes until thick and creamy.Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then purée using a blender or food processor until smooth. Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing through as much liquid as possible. Season to taste with the lemon juice, salt and pepper and set aside.Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and put the potatoes in to cook for 15 minutes. Add the broccoli and cook for another 3–4 minutes, until a sharp knife glides into the centre of a potato without resistance and the broccoli is tender but not soft. Drain the vegetables, return to the pan and toss with half the butter and the chives and season with a little salt and pepper.Meanwhile, season the cod on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the cod, skin-side down, and fry for 3–4 minutes, or until the skin is crisp. Turn the fish over, add the remaining butter and the lemon juice and fry for another 1–2 minutes until cooked through.Serve the fish with the potatoes and broccoli and some chives scattered over. If you are serving this with the sauce, gently reheat the sauce in a small pan, then pour about three tablespoons of sauce into each wide, shallow bowl. Place the potato, broccoli and cod on top and serve with some chives scattered over.
