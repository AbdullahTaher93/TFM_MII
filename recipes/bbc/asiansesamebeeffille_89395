Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil.For the Asian sesame beef fillet, heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Rub the sesame oil into the steak and fry the meat for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your taste. Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the steak, then remove the meat from the pan. Set aside to rest.For the orange and vegetable salad, cook the potatoes, carrots and asparagus in the salted, boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until tender but not cooked through, then drain.Add the partially-cooked vegetables, soy sauce, stock cube, honey, and orange juice to the beef pan. Simmer over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly.To serve, arrange the orange slices on a serving plate and spoon the orange and vegetable salad into the centre. Place the sesame beef fillet on top of the salad, and garnish with the chervil sprig.
