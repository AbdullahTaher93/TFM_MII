Repeat until you have four circles of Parmesan. Bake for 3–8 minutes, or until the cheese has melted. Leave to cool.Pour the stock into a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer.Meanwhile, heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Melt 75g/2½oz butter, then fry the mushrooms until slightly coloured and any moisture released has evaporated. Transfer to a plate and set aside.Heat the remaining 75g/2½oz butter and the oil in the same pan, add the onion and fry gently for 10–12 minutes, or until soft. Add the rice and stir until coated.Pour in the wine and let it bubble until almost evaporated. Start adding the warm stock, about two ladlefuls at a time, stirring constantly and ensuring all of it is absorbed before adding more. Continue adding stock for 15–20 minutes, stirring all the time, until the rice is tender and has a creamy coating. Set aside.For the artichokes, heat a sauté pan over a low heat and add the butter. Once melted, add the artichokes and cook for 5–7 minutes. Add the thyme and cook for 3–5 minutes, or until cooked through.
