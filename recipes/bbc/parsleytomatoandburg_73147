Rinse the bulgar wheat in several changes of cold water, drain well and put in a large salad bowl.Spread the diced tomatoes and their juice over the bulgar then add the sliced onions.  Put the chopped parsley over the spring onions, looking out for big pieces, if there are any, take them out and chop them finely. Add the chopped mint to the parsley, cover with a clean kitchen towel and leave for about half an hour for the bulgar wheat to absorb the tomato juices and soften.Season with cinnamon, allspice, pepper and salt to taste.  Add the lemon juice and olive oil and mix well together. Taste, adjust seasoning if necessary and serve immediately with either Little Gem lettuce or fresh vine leaves.
