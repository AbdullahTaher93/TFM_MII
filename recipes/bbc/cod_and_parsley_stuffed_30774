Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Wash the potatoes well, dry them and prick several times with a fork. Pour some olive oil into your hands and rub over the potatoes. Place on a baking tray and bake for 50–60 minutes, or until crispy and cooked.Meanwhile, for the filling, put the milk, garlic and bay in a saucepan, season and bring to a simmer. Add the cod and cook gently for 4 minutes, then remove from the heat. Lift out the cod using a slotted spoon and place on a plate. Pour the milk mixture into a jug.Let the potatoes cool slightly, then cut them in half lengthways. Scoop out the flesh and put it in a bowl. Flake the cod and add it to the potato. Mix in the parsley. Add 150ml/5fl oz of the milk and mash. Add a little more milk if the mixture is too stiff, but don’t let it become sloppy.Spoon the flesh back into the potato skins and scatter the cheese on top. Place on a baking tray and bake for 25 minutes, or until piping hot and golden.Serve immediately, drizzled with a little extra virgin olive oil, with lemon wedges and watercress.
