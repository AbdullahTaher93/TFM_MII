Mix in the lemon juice.Whisk the egg whites in a large, clean glass bowl until stiff peaks form. Gradually fold them into the mascarpone cream. Add a little more sugar or lemon juice, or both, if needed.Set aside three or four marrons glacés for decoration. Chop the rest and mix them into the mascarpone cream.Cut the Madeleines in half horizontally. Mix the rum with the milk and soak the Madeleines in the mixture.
