For the omelette, cook the rice noodles according to packet instructions and refresh under cold running water. Drain, then place into a bowl.Add the lime juice and zest, one tablespoon of the soy sauce, and all of the mint and coriander to the bowl. Stir well.In another bowl, beat the eggs with the remaining tablespoon of soy sauce and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and pour in the eggs. Cook gently until the eggs are beginning to set. Place the noodle mixture onto one half of the omelette, then fold the other half of the omelette over the top to enclose the filling. Continue to fry on both sides until golden-brown.For the crisp noodles, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Add the noodles to the pan and deep fry for about 30 seconds, until puffed up and golden-brown. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.For the sticky peppers, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and gently fry the yellow pepper, chilli and garlic for 1-2 minutes. Add the sugar and white wine vinegar and cook gently for 8-10 minutes, or until the peppers have broken down and the juices have become sticky.To serve, slide the omelette onto a serving plate and top with the crisp noodles and the sticky peppers.
