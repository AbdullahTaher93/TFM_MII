Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.For the banana fritters, sift the flour, cornflour and baking powder together into a bowl then stir in the water and sesame oil. Add the bananas and gently mix until coated.Fill a wide pan half full with vegetable oil and heat until hot, or alternatively heat a deep fat fryer to 180C/350F. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Place the bananas into the pan and fry until golden-brown, then drain on paper towels.For the soufflé, lightly grease four large ramekins with butter, then dust with half the sugar.Place the egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk to soft peaks. Add the remaining caster sugar and whisk to stiff peaks. Fold in the custard and carefully spoon into the ramekins.Place the ramekins on a baking tray and immediately transfer to the oven. Bake for 10 minutes, or until golden-brown and risen.Meanwhile, to make the caramel, place the sugar in a frying pan and heat until all the sugar has melted. Increase the heat and continue cooking without stirring, until the syrup becomes a light caramel colour. Add the sesame seeds and stir well.Remove from the heat and carefully add one banana fritter at a time to the hot caramel (CAUTION: The caramel will be very hot, take care not to burn yourself). Turn it over with a fork to completely coat the fritter in caramel, then remove immediately and plunge into a bowl of iced water. Remove and drain on a wire rack while cooking the remaining fritters.Serve the fritters immediately with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, the soufflé and a spoonful of custard.
