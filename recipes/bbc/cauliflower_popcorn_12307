Leave it to steam dry for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 4.In a bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. In another large bowl combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic granules, thyme, smoked paprika and dried oregano and season well with salt and pepper.Tip the cauliflower into the egg and milk mixture and mix well, making sure the egg gets into all the creases and crevices of each cauliflower piece. Tip the cauliflower into the breadcrumbs and toss to coat.Arrange the cauliflower on a baking tray in a single layer and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 20 minutes, or until starting to turn crisp and golden-brown. Using a fish slice turn the cauliflower pieces over and cook for a further 10 minutes, or until crisp all over.Serve while still warm.
