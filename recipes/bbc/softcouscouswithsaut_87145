Place the couscous into a medium-sized bowl and pour over enough boiling water to cover the couscous by a centimetre. Cover with cling film and leave for three minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed.Remove the cling film, fluff up the grains with a fork and then pour over the warmed cream.Stir in the herbs and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the pepper and fry for 2-3 minutes.To serve, pile the couscous onto a plate, top with the peppers and crumble over the Stilton.
