To make the stock,  place the prawn shells and heads into a saucepan pan with a splash of oil and fry for 5 minutes, or until they turn a deep pink colour. Pour over the stock, add the saffron and simmer gently for 20 minutes. Strain into a clean pan and keep warm.Preheat a barbecue to a medium heat. Heat a good splash of oil in a large paella pan, add the chicken and fry until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.Add the chorizo to the pan, fry for a few minutes until crisp, then add the onions. Fry for 5 minutes until soft, then add the garlic, tomatoes and smoked paprika.Fry for 5 minutes until the tomatoes start to break down. Return the chicken to the pan and then stir in the rice. Pour over the stock, give everything a quick stir and then leave to simmer for 10 minutes without stirring.Arrange the prawns and peppers over the top of the rice, then cover the pan with a sheet of aluminium foil, put the lid on the barbecue and leave to cook for 10 minutes, or until the prawns have turned pink. Remove the pan from the heat and leave to stand for 5 minutes before serving with chopped parsley and lemon wedges.
