Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Trim the top stem of each fig if necessary, then cut a cross almost to the base. Squeeze the figs from the base so the four tips splay outwards.Mash up the stilton, then divide it between the figs – approximately a teaspoon in each, pushing it down into the centre of each fig. Wrap the figs in the Parma ham – the ham should come around two thirds up the fig, leaving the tips and the cheese exposed.Place in a small baking dish, then drizzle with the honey, thyme leaves and olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.Bake in the oven for around 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the ham has browned.To make the salsa, put the beetroot, apple, onion and herbs in a bowl. Season well with salt and pepper. Whisk together the oil and vinegar and season with salt. Pour this over the beetroot mixture and stir to combine. Sprinkle over the walnuts.Serve the salsa with the stuffed figs.
