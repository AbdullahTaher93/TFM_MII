Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 2 hours, or overnight.Cook the bacon under the grill or in a pan until crisp and golden-brown. Set aside on a piece of kitchen paper. Once cold, snip into little pieces.Arrange two or three lettuce leaves closely together to make a cup shape on a large platter. Top with some rocket leaves. Repeat, so that you have six cups of lettuce arranged in a circle to look like a wreath.Spoon the chicken salad on top. Arrange the avocado on top of the chicken. Sprinkle with pumpkin seeds and bacon pieces. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
