Place the chicken supremes in a shallow dish and cover with the wine, stock, honey and garlic. Cover and marinate in the fridge for 2 hours. Remove the chicken from the marinade, drain and leave to dry on a cloth or kitchen paper, reserving the marinade.Place the marinade in a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Cook for 15 minutes, or until reduced by two thirds.Meanwhile, pan-fry the chicken in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter and oil for 15 minutes, or until cooked through and the thickest part of the meat shows no trace of pink. Take out of the pan and leave to rest.Add the onions and mushrooms to the pan and cook for a few minutes. Drain the excess fat and then add the bacon and cook for 5–8 minutes, or until browned.Pour the reduced marinade into the pan and boil rapidly until syrupy. Add the remaining butter to make the sauce glossy. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.For the root vegetable röstis, place all of the vegetables into a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the parsley. Place the mixture in a muslin cloth or clean tea towel and squeeze out as much water as possible.Place two 10cm/4in metal rings in a roasting tin and grease with the oil. Press the vegetable mixture tightly into the rings, add a knob of butter on top of each and cook for 10 minutes. Turn over and cook for another 10 minutes. Leave to cool a little before removing the ring.Place the vegetable röstis on warmed plates and top each with a chicken supreme. Pour the red wine sauce around the röstis and serve immediately.
