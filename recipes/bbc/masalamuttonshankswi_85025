Place the mutton shanks in a large saucepan with the turmeric, ginger, garlic and some salt.Add enough water to cover and simmer gently for 1Â½ hours or until the meat is tender.Meanwhile, grind all the curry paste ingredients together in a spice grinder or pestle and mortar. Set aside until required.For the curry, heat two tablespoons of the sunflower oil in a large deep frying pan and add the bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves and cardamom and fry until aromatic.Add the onion and fry until it is softened, but not coloured.Add the tomato and cook for five minutes, then add the cumin, coriander and green chillies and cook for a further three minutes.Add the curry paste to the frying pan and cook for another two minutes, before adding the cooked mutton, salt to taste and enough of the mutton cooking water to come halfway up the shanks. Cook for another 20 minutes, turning the shanks over several times during cooking and adding more of the mutton cooking water if the sauce gets too thick.For the rice, heat a frying pan until hot and add the sunflower oil.Add the mustard seeds and chana dal and fry until they start to pop, taking care as the oil may splatter.Add the cashew nuts, curry leaves, turmeric, asafoetida and ginger and stir fry for 1-2 minutes.Finally add the cooked rice and lemon juice and cook until hot all the way through.Serve the mutton with a spoonful of rice and sprinkle with coriander.
