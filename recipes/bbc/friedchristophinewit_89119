Parboil the christophine slices in boiling water for 3-4 minutes, then drain.Melt half of the butter in a frying pan and fry the christophine and the whole scotch bonnet chillies for 4-5 minutes, turning the slices once, until the christophine is tender and golden-brown on both sides.Microwave the corn for 4-5 minutes on high, then remove and fry in another frying pan with the remaining butter for 3-4 minutes, or until the corn is tender.To serve, pile the fried christophine and chillies onto a serving plate, and place the corn on the cob on the side.
