Grease four 7.5cm/3in metal mini pudding basins, ramekins or dariole moulds with butter. Dust the inside of each dish with the cocoa powder and then shake out any excess. Place the dishes on a baking tray.Melt the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water or in the microwave for about 1 minute (microwave ovens vary so you may need more or less time). Stir until smooth then set aside while the cake mixture is made.In a separate bowl, beat the sugar, egg and egg yolk with a metal whisk or an electric hand-held whisk for 2–3 minutes, or until pale and thick. Stir in the melted chocolate mixture and then fold in the flour until well combined.Divide the mixture between the prepared dishes and chill in the fridge on the baking tray for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.Bake the puddings for 10–12 minutes, or until the puddings have risen and the tops have just formed a crust. Remove the fondants from the oven and, holding with oven gloves, turn out onto four plates. Sprinkle with a little more sifted cocoa powder and serve immediately with ice cream or cream.
