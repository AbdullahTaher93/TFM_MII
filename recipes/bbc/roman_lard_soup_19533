To cook the beans, put a large pan on a medium heat and sweat the lardo and garlic for 5 minutes, until the lardo is crispy and the fat has rendered out.Add the beans, vegetables and herbs and cover with water. Cook gently for 1â€“2 hours, or until the beans are soft.To make the soup, heat the soft lard in another large pan over a low heat. Add the onion, garlic, celery and leek and cook for 20 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Add the chicken stock and a ladle of the beans and cooking liquor and cook for a further 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.To serve, ladle the soup into bowls, top with the cubes of bread, a piece of wafer-thin lardo, and sprinkle over the Parmesan and fennel tops.
