Place half a small strawberry into each of four sections of an ice cube tray and fill up the tray with water to about 80 per cent full.Top up the cube sections with a small drop of strawberry liqueur (not too much as the alcohol won't freeze). Place into the freezer for 2-3 hours or until completely frozen.Place the remaining one tablespoon of strawberry liqueur into a Martini glass and swirl around the glass.To serve, place the strawberry ice cubes into the glass and top up with champagne.
