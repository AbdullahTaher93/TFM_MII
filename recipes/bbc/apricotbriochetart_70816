Lightly grease a shallow ovenproof, sided dish (about 28cm/11in diameter). Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.Lightly whisk the egg and caster sugar together in a bowl.Add the mascarpone and whisk again until smooth and there are no lumps.Arrange the brioche slices as neatly as possible in a single layer on the greased tart plate to completely cover the plate.Trim the brioche slices as necessary to fit. Spread the mascarpone mixture over the brioche slices to about 1cm/½in away from the edge. You don't have to be accurate about this!Arrange the apricot halves neatly in a spiral over the mascarpone right to the edge of the brioche. Sprinkle the demerara sugar over the apricots.Bake in the pre-heated oven for 30-35 minutes until  the custard is set and golden.Serve immediately with créme fraïche and dust with icing sugar.
