When melted, remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.Place the eggs, sugar and vanilla in a large mixing bowl and whisk with a handheld electric mixer and until creamy.Beat in the melted chocolate and butter mixture, then beat in the flour, salt and baking powder.Stir in the chocolate chips.Use a tablespoon to place small heaps of the mixture on the lined baking tray at least 5cm/2in apart.
