For the clams with garlic and chilli, clean the clams in cold water. Discard any open shells that do not close when given a sharp tap. Heat the oil in a large saut√© pan with a lid. Cook the garlic and chilli until just starting to colour, then add the clams and wine. Cook with the lid on for a few minutes until the clams have opened. Add the pak choi, season and reserve. Discard any clams that have not opened.Heat the grill to high. Grill the chorizo strips alongside the razor clams for 2 minutes, until the shells have opened.For the soft shell crab, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Mix the flour with the salt and chilli flakes. Gradually add the sparkling water until you have a batter. Dip the crab pieces in the batter to coat them. Deep-fry for a few minutes until golden. Set aside to drain on kitchen paper.Coat the aubergine in batter and deep-fry until golden. Add the basil leaves to the oil and fry until crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.To serve, tip the small clams, pak choi and juice into a large oval serving dish, cut the grilled chorizo into chunks on an angle and scatter about. Add the razor clams and finally the pieces of soft shell crab and aubergine and garnish with the basil.
