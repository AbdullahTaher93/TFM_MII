Season with salt and pepper.Divide the potato dough into 12-16 equal portions and roll into balls. Flatten the ball into a disc in your palm and press a large pinch of the chestnut date mixture into the centre, closing the potato dough over the top. Use your hands to roll into a little, filled kofta, then roll the kofte in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with the remaining mixture.Heat a deep-fat fryer to 180C , or until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Carefully, using a slotted spoon, lower the kofta into the fryer in small batches. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown.
