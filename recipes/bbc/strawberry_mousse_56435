Soak the gelatine in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes, or until soft.Meanwhile, blend the strawberries, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of sugar in  a food processor until smooth. Remove 100g/3½oz of the purée, cover and store in the fridge until ready to serve (this is to top the mousses).Drain the gelatine and add to a bowl with 2 tablespoons of the purée. Melt in the microwave or a small saucepan, but don’t let it boil.Whisk the egg whites until they hold firm peaks. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons of sugar and whisk again, until stiff, smooth and glossy.Whip the cream with the vanilla extract until it holds medium-firm peaks. Using a large spoon, fold the remaining strawberry purée, followed by the gelatine mixture, into the cream until thoroughly combined. Gently fold in the egg whites. Spoon the mousse into glasses, then cover and chill for at least 2 hours, or until set.To serve, spoon the reserved strawberry purée over the top of each mousse and top each mousse with a halved strawberry.
