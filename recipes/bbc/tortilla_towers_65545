For the spicy shredded chicken, put all the dry ingredients and lime zest in a plastic food bag and shake well.Pat dry the chicken thighs using kitchen paper, then squeeze the lime juice over them. Add them to the bag and mix well so that the spices coat the chicken. The lime is for flavour, but it also helps the spices to stick.Leave the chicken to marinate in the fridge for an hour. Towards the end of the marinating time, preheat the oven to 180C/Fan 160C/Gas 4.Tip the chicken into a roasting dish and roast for 35 minutes, or until cooked through. Set aside to cool, then remove the meat from the bone and shred.Meanwhile, to make the roasted tomato salsa, preheat the grill to high. Put the tomatoes, onions, fresh chillies and garlic on a baking tray and lightly brush with oil. Grill for 10 minutes, or until the tomato skins are blackened. Place all the charred ingredients in a food processor. Add the chipotle, coriander and lime juice and pulse until a chunky consistency is achieved. Season to taste and set aside.For the guacamole, cut the avocados in half and remove the stones. Cut the flesh from the skins and roughly chop it, then put it in a bowl and lightly crush it using a fork. Add the soured cream, lemon and lime juice and zest. Season to taste and finish with a drizzle of oil. Set aside.To construct the tortilla towers, place a dollop of guacamole in the centre of each plate and place a tortilla on top. Add a layer of guacamole, then chicken, salsa, soured cream and cheese. Add another tortilla and repeat again. Finish with sprinkle of coriander and spring onions. Serve.
