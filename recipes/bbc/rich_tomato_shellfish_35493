Add the oil and, when it is hot, add the onion, fennel and celery and sweat for 10 minutes, or until softened.Stir in the smoked paprika, then the tomatoes, tomato purée, bay leaf, garlic, chilli and wine. Cook for 15 minutes, or until reduced slightly.Pour in the stock, then stir in the potatoes. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until just cooked, then season with salt and pepper.Discard any mussels with broken shells and any that refuse to close when tapped. Add the mussels to the pan and cook for 3 minutes, or until opened, then add the prawns and cook for a further 2–3 minutes, or until all the seafood is cooked through. Discard any mussels that remain closed.Serve immediately in deep, warmed bowls, sprinkled with parsley, with crusty bread to mop up the juices.
