Stir in the flour and cook over a low heat for 2 minutes, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon, until slightly sandy textured and a light golden brown colour – do not allow the roux to darken too much.Lift the onion out of the milk and discard, then pour a third of the milk onto the roux, whisking all the time. Cook very gently for a couple of minutes before adding the remaining milk. Gently simmer the mixture for 5–10 minutes, stirring all the time, until just thick enough to coat the back of the wooden spoon. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.Preheat the grill to high.Pour the sauce into a clean saucepan, add the cheese and mustard and heat, stirring until smooth.
