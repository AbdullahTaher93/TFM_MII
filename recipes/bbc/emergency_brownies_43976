Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3.Warm the butter, sugar and maple syrup in a small, heavy-based saucepan, stirring occasionally until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat.Mix together the flour, cocoa and salt in a bowl, then beat into the melted butter with a wooden spoon until smooth.In a small bowl, whisk the egg with the vanilla then stir into the pan, ensuring everything is well combined. Fold in the nuts and chocolate chips. Pour and scrape the batter into the foil tin. Bake for 15–20 minutes, until it is beginning to come away at the sides and the top has dried a little just around the edges.Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool – but not completely. I leave them for 20–30 minutes (and that’s difficult enough). If your need is not so great, or you want them to go further, cut each square in half again.
