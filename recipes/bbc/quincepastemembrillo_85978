Place the quince pieces into a large pan and add enough water to cover. Add the vanilla pod and bring to the boil. Place a lid on the pan and boil for 30-40 minutes, or until quinces are very soft.Drain the liquid from the quinces and transfer the quinces to a scale to weigh. Note the weight of the quinces - this is the weight of caster sugar you will require.Place the fruit into a food processor and blend until very smooth.Return to the original pan and add an equal weight of sugar.Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves.Continue to cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for 1-1Â½ hours, or until the quince paste has thickened and has a deep orange colour.Preheat the oven to 50C/120F.Pour the cooked paste out onto a greased and lined 20cm/8in x 20cm/8in baking tray and smooth the paste out evenly.Place into the oven for one hour to speed up the setting process.Remove from the oven and slice into manageable portions.
