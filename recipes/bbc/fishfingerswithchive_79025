Heat a heavy bottomed saucepan, a third full of vegetable oil, until a breadcrumb sizzles in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)Place the flour in a large bowl and beat in the egg and salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.Add the carbonated water and whisk to create a batter the consistency of double cream.Dredge the sole pieces in flour then dip pieces into the batter to coat.Place in the hot oil and deep-fry for 2-3 minutes, until crisp and golden. Carefully remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.To make the dip, mix the yoghurt with the chives and lime juice. Transfer to a serving bowl.Serve the fish fingers on a plate with the dip and lime wedges alongside.
