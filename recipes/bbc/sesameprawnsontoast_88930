Drizzle one tablespoon of the olive oil over both sides of the bread and toast in a hot chargrill pan for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Set aside.Place the prawns, one tablespoon of the olive oil, egg white, flour, salt and freshly ground black pepper into a food processor and blend to a smooth paste.Spread the prawn paste evenly onto one side of the toast and sprinkle over the sesame seeds, lightly pressing them into the prawn paste.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and place the toast, prawn-side down, into the pan and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown and the prawn is cooked through.To serve, cut the toast in half diagonally and place on a serving plate, garnished with the lime half.
