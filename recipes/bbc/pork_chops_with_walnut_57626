Preheat the oven to 200C/Fan 180/Gas 6. Season the chops with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan until hot. Holding the chops with a pair of tongs, press them down in the pan on their rind edge and fry until the rind starts to blister and colour. Put the pork chops down flat and fry for 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a baking tray and roast for 10-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for at least 10 minutes.Meanwhile, put the stock and liquorice paste in a saucepan and heat until the paste has dissolved. Drain the prunes and add the juice and walnut liqueur to the stock. Increase the heat and simmer until the liquid is reduced by one-third.Whisk in half the butter and add in the prunes, cooking until heated through. Remove the pan from the heat.Melt the remaining butter in a frying pan placed over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the greens and a splash of water and gently fry for a couple of minutes, until wilted. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Place the chops on serving plates and serve with the wilted greens and the prune sauce spooned over the top.
