Place into the oven to cook for six minutes, or until cooked through.Add the onions to the same pan you cooked the rabbit in and fry for 4-5 minutes, making sure you scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.Add the sherry, scraping the bottom to release all of the flavours. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and reduce the volume by two thirds.Add the garlic, capers and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer to reduce the liquid by a third.Return the rabbit pieces to the pan and add the walnuts, olive oil and lemon juice.Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, arrange a large spoonful of the cooked linguine onto each of four plates and top with rabbit stew.Garnish with chopped parsley and serve.
