Preheat the oven to 120C/100C Fan/Gas ½.In a food processor, pulse the oats until you have a scruffy flour. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the pecans, baking powder and salt.In a separate bowl, mix the mashed banana with the milk (you can do this in the food processor, if you like). Beat the banana mixture into the dry ingredients and leave the batter to sit for a few minutes.For the blueberry compôte, put the blueberries and sugar in a small pan with a teaspoon of water and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until you have a thick shiny compôte. Set aside until ready to serve.Heat a non-stick pan over a medium heat. Add the banana slices and fry on both sides in the dry pan until golden-brown and caramelised. Keep warm in the oven.Put the pan back on the heat and add a little coconut oil or butter. Drop in a generous tablespoon of batter for each pancake. Once the sides are cooked and bubbles have risen to the top, scatter over a handful of blueberries and flip the pancake over. Cook for another couple of minutes on the other side, or until lightly coloured. (The pancakes will stay a little moist in the middle because of the banana, so don’t worry.) Keep them warm in the oven while you cook the remaining pancakes.Serve the pancakes in a stack with the banana slices. Add some chopped pecans and a squeeze of lime, and, if you like, with a drizzle of maple syrup. Serve the compôte on the side.
