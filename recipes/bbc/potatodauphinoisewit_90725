Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.Place the cream into a pan and heat until it almost boils, then reduce the heat and stir in the cheese until melted. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add the potato slices. Cook for 4-5 minutes, then transfer to an ovenproof gratin dish and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling.
