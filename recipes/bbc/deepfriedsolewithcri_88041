Dip the sole into a little flour and shake off the excess and then dip into the batter. Then gently drop the battered fish into the hot oil. Deep fry for  five minutes or until crisp and golden-brown.

Add the lemon juice and parsley, and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for one more minute.To serve, pile the crisp noodles onto a serving plate, top with the deep fried sole and pour over the brown butter sauce and garnish with lemon wedges.
