Place one of the tea bags in a heatproof jug and add the hot water to make a strong tea. Leave this to infuse for a few minutes and then stir the milk into the jug to make a milky Earl Grey tea.In a large bowl, mix the flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and the leaves from the remaining tea bag together. Pour the milky tea into the bowl and mix gradually until combined. Knead the mixture with your hands for 8–10 minutes, or until it forms a soft dough. Add the butter. Knead some more to thoroughly incorporate the butter and then add the chopped peel. If you have a stand mixer, knead for 5–6 minutes, add the butter, knead for a further 2–3 minutes, add the peel and knead until it comes together. Form the dough into a large ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl in a warm place for at least 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.Knock back the dough on a lightly floured work surface for a few minutes and then divide into 10 small balls. Flatten the balls into 10cm/4in circles with your fingers or a small rolling pin. Tightly roll them up into a cigar shape and pinch the ends. Roll each dough shape with both hands and stretch until each piece is 30cm/12in long.Tie each rope into a knot shape, tucking the loose ends into the centre. Place the knots on a baking tray lined with baking paper, cover with a tea towel and leave to rise for 60–75 minutes, or until very puffy looking.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Brush the knots with the beaten egg then bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Leave to cool on the wire rack.Meanwhile, for the drizzle, make half a cup of Earl Grey tea using the tea bag and leave to cool. Mix the cooled Earl Grey tea and the icing sugar together, using just enough of each to make a thin icing. Once the rolls are completely cool, drizzle the icing over them with a spoon. Serve immediately.
