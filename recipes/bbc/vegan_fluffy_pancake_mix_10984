For the mix, combine all the ingredients in an airtight container and shake until thoroughly combined. Store in a cool, dry place until needed.To make a single serving of pancakes, put the vegan pancake mix into a bowl and make a small well in the centre. Add the liquid ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined.Heat a frying pan over a medium-high heat. Use a piece of kitchen paper to wipe a film of oil over the surface. When the pan is hot, add dessert spoonfuls of the batter to the pan (allowing some room for spreading). Cook the pancakes until you can see bubbles forming and popping on the surface and the bottom is a dark golden-brown colour. Flip the pancakes and cook for 1 minute on the other side. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.Serve the pancakes stacked on plates and drizzle with maple syrup, or serve with fresh fruit or jam. Eat immediately.
