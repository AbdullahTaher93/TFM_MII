Put the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar into a large bowl.Pour the milk and melted butter into a jug, crack in the egg and whisk well using a fork.Pour the liquid into the flour mixture and, using the fork, beat until smooth.Melt a knob of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add two small ladlefuls of batter to create pancakes a little larger than a pineapple ring. Leave to cook for 15 seconds, then top each pancake with a pineapple ring.When the top of the pancake begins to bubble, turn it over and cook until golden brown and the pancake has risen to about 1cm/Â½in thick.Repeat until all the batter is used up. Serve the pancakes with maple syrup if you like.
