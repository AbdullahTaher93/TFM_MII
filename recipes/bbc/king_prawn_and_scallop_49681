Lay the scallops round the edge of the hot wok, to get a little colour on the sides.Toss the wok or gently turn the seafood over, then add the rice wine.Add all the prepared vegetables and gently toss until the choi sum and pak choi have slightly wilted - this will take a further couple of minutesAdd the red chilli and light soy sauce, to taste.Divide the mixture into two bowls and drizzle half a teaspoon of sesame oil over each portion.
