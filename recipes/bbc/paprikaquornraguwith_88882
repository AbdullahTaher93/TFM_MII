Continue to fry for 5-7 minutes, then add the wine and bring to the boil.Add the cream and tomato halves and simmer for 3-4 minutes.For the dumplings, place the flour, baking powder, oil and enough milk to bind the mix into a food processor and pulse until just coming together as a dough.Add the cheese and pulse again to just combine.Roll pieces of the mix into balls about the size of a tangerine, then place them onto a baking sheet. Press the dough balls down slightly, then transfer to the oven to bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden-brown.To serve, place the ragu into a serving bowl with the dumplings alongside.
