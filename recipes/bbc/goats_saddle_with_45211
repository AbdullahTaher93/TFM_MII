Heat the butter in a pan until foaming. Place the goat in with the butter and fry for 6-10 minutes, basting all the time - cook the meat longer, if you prefer your meat more well done. After a few minutes, add the artichokes. Remove and place on a carving dish, covering loosely with foil, and rest for at least six minutes.Blanch the morel mushrooms for ten seconds in a pan of salted boiling water. Drain thoroughly and add the morels to the pan used to cook the goat and cook for three minutes.Add the lazy garlic, cook for 15-20 seconds, or until fragrant, and then deglaze with the sherry vinegar. Once the vinegar has evaporated, add the gravy and bring to the boil.Add the wild garlic and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the meat in slices with the morels and wild garlic on the side.
