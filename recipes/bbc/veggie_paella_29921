Stir for a few seconds more then add the sherry (or white wine) and bring to a simmer.Add the vegetable stock, stir well and cook the rice gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. (If the rice is looking dry during cooking, add some water.)Add the artichokes, peppers and olives, stir well then reduce the heat to very low and cook, without stirring, for a further 15 minutes, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed.
