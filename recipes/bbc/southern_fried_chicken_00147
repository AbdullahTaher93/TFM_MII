Once hot, add the bread and cook until crisp on all sides.Heat a large frying pan and add a little olive oil and the remaining butter. Season and colour the lettuce cut-side down, before adding the chopped parsley, a squeeze of lemon juice and finally the croutons.Drain the chicken pieces, dredge in the flour and then deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown and cooked through. Carefully remove using a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.To serve, spoon the ranch dressing into the centre of each plate, cut the Baby Gem into quarters, arrange on the plate with the chicken and radishes and spoon over the remaining croutons from the pan.
