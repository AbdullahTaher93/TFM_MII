For the rice pudding, melt the butter in a saucepan until foaming and fry the rice for one minute. Add 50g/2oz of the sugar, 500ml/16floz of the milk, the double cream and vanilla pod and bring the mixture to the boil.Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30-40 minutes until tender and all the liquid is absorbed. (If you’re cooking  the rice pudding in advance, spread the rice onto a tray and set aside to cool, chill in the fridge until needed.)Return the rice to a saucepan, add the remaining milk and slowly bring to the boil. Stir in the clotted cream until well combined.Spoon the mixture into a baking dish, sprinkle over the remaining sugar and caramelise with a cook’s torch or under a hot grill.Meanwhile, for the caramelised pineapple, heat a frying pan until hot, add the pineapple and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side. Add the lemon juice, sugar and butter and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling and thickened.To serve, spoon some pineapple slices onto serving plates, spoon the rice pudding alongside and finish with a drizzle of the pineapple caramel.
