Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Grease a baking tray.Mix the spring onion, potato, carrot, peas and korma paste together in a bowl.Lay a sheet of filo pastry lengthways on the work surface. Brush a little oil all over the pastry. Then fold it in half lengthways to make a long, thin rectangle and brush a little more oil on top.Place one-quarter of the filling mixture at one end of the strip, leaving a 2cm/1in border. Take the right corner and fold diagonally to the left, enclosing the filling and forming a triangle. Fold again along the upper crease of the triangle. Keep folding in this way until you reach the end of the strip. Brush the outer surface with more oil. Place onto the baking tray and cover while you make the rest of the samosas.Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.
