To make the dal, place both dal in a large saucepan and pour over 1.7 litres/3 pints water. Add the chillies, turmeric and salt and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10–15 minutes, or until cooked through.Meanwhile, heat the oil and butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Add the cumin, garlic, ginger, onion and tomatoes and cook for 12–15 minutes.To make the chapatis, combine the flour with the salt and 100–150ml/3½–5fl oz water to form a dough. Knead well, shape into golf ball-sized balls, and set aside on a lightly floured surface.Heat a tava or griddle pan over a medium heat. Roll out each ball of dough and griddle each chapati for a few minutes on both sides. Spread with a little butter and keep warm until ready to serve.When the dal is cooked, stir in the onion and tomato mixture and the garam masala, bring back to the boil, then remove from the heat. Garnish with coriander before serving with the chapatis.
