Cook the thighs for 10–15 minutes on each side, until  golden-brown, slightly charred and cooked through. Rest the chicken for 2–3 minutes and cut into slices.Meanwhile mix together the salad ingredients in a bowl. Put the coleslaw ingredients in another bowl and mix to combine. In a third bowl, mix together the mango purée and mayonnaise.Heat the rotis in a hot frying pan or on the barbecue, until they colour and puff up on both sides.Place the warm rotis on four plates. Put some  salad and coleslaw in the middle of each roti. Top with the jerk chicken, drizzle with the mango sauce, wrap and eat.
