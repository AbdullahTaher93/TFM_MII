Place the chapati flour in a large bowl and mix in the salt. Measure 300ml/½ pint water in a jug and add enough to the flour to just bring the mixture together. Using your hands, knead the dough until smooth. Tip out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Set aside to rest for 15–20 minutes.Knead the mixture again on a floured work surface for a couple of minutes. Using floured hands, divide the dough into eight equal pieces and roll into smooth balls.Flatten the balls a little before rolling each one out on a floured surface into a thin circle, approximately 13–18cm/5–7in in diameter.Heat a chapati pan (or a non-stick frying pan) over a high heat until hot. Add the chapati and cook for 30–60 seconds before turning over and cooking the other side. The chapati should puff up and brown spots will appear. (If possible, place the chapatis over an open flame until charred and golden brown in places.)Store the cooked chapatis in a clean tea towel while you cook the rest. Serve warm, spread with a little butter or alongside your favourite curry.
