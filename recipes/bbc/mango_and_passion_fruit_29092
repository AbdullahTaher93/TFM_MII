Preheat the oven to 110C/225F/Gas ¼. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.Beat the egg whites in a bowl until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Slowly add the caster sugar, whisking well after each addition, until the mixture is smooth and glossy.Carefully fold in one-third of the icing sugar, then repeat with the remaining two-thirds.Spoon the meringue mixture into a piping bag and pipe 18 small dollops of meringue onto the lined baking tray. Make a small hollow in the top of each meringue with the back of a teaspoon (for the filling to go in), then bake in the oven for 1½ -1¾ hours, or until cooked through.Meanwhile, for the filling, blend the mango slices and lime zest to a purée in a food processor. Stir in the pulp of one of the passion fruit.To serve, spoon a little mango and passion fruit purée into the hollow of each meringue and drizzle over the remaining passion fruit pulp.
