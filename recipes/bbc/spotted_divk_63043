Generously butter the inside of five 1.2 litre/2 pint pudding basins.Beat the golden syrup, butter, sugar and lemon zest together in a mixer until light and fluffy.Beat in half the eggs followed by half the flour and when well combined, add the remaining eggs and flour then stir in the currants. The mixture should be at a just dropping consistency. Add a splash of milk if the mixture is too thick.Spoon the mixture into the pudding basins, only filling them three quarters full, then smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.Loosely cover with clingfilm, allowing room for the cling film to inflate as the mixture rises, and cook in the microwave for five minutes. The pudding is done when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.Leave to stand for five minutes then run a blunt knife around the edge of the pudding to loosen the sides, carefully invert onto a deep plate and remove the basin.
