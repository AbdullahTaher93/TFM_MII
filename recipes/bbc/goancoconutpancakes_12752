It should have a thin pouring consistency.Mix together all the ingredients for the stuffing.Heat a little oil or butter in a 15-18cm/6-7in frying pan. Pour in enough batter to coat the bottom thinly, tilting the pan to spread it. Cook for 1 minute, until lightly browned underneath, then flip over and cook the other side. Turn out and make the remaining pancakes in the same way.Divide the filling between the pancakes and roll up.
