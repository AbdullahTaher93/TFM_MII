For the curry paste, place all of the curry paste ingredients, except the spinach, into a food processor and blend to a smooth a paste.Pour the paste into a frying pan over a medium heat and fry for 3-4 minutes to bring out the flavours and fragrances of the paste.Add the spinach and fry for one minute, until wilted down.For the chicken, place all of the chicken ingredients into a bowl, stir well,  then leave to marinate for ten minutes.Heat a griddle pan until smoking, then add the chicken and griddle for 5-7 minutes each side, or until completely cooked through. (Check that the juices run clear when pierced with a skewer at its thickest point.)For the crisp carrot strips, heat the vegetable oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan, until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden in 30 seconds when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Add the carrots and deep-fry for 5-6 minutes, or until turning golden and crisp. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle the carrot strips with salt to taste.To serve, pour the curry paste sauce into the centre of a plate. Place the chicken on top and place with a handful of crisp carrot strips on top.
