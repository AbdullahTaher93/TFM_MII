Add the oil gradually and as soon as the texture is smooth and shiny, stop and transfer the mixture to a jar.For the chicken, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and have a roasting dish (about 30x22x5cm/12x8Â½x2in) at the ready.Bring a pan of water to the boil, then add the gnocchi. Boil until the gnocchi come to the surface, then take off the heat, drain and set aside.Put the chicken into a large bowl. Add the honey, oil, curry paste, peanut butter and salt, and mix it well with your hands. Add the chicken to the roasting dish along with the broccoli, onions and gnocchi and bake for 30 minutes, giving it a stir halfway through.Serve topped with the chopped nuts, coriander and a squeeze of lime.
