Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper.Whisk to combine the sunflower oil, lime juice and caster sugar together, whisking until the mixture looks pale.Keep whisking and add the garam masala, chilli powder, and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Add the nuts to the spice mixture, stir in the honey and mix together until the nuts are evenly coated.Place the nuts in an even layer onto the lined baking sheet and roast in the oven for five minutes before turning them over and roasting for a further 8-10 minutes until they have a shiny, golden coating and are no longer sticky.  Watch carefully towards the end of cooking to ensure the nuts do not burn.Leave the nuts on the tray to cool.  They will continue to harden as they cool and can be served either warm or cold.
