For the couscous, heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the couscous and stir well to coat in the oil. Keep stirring over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients and cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the stock has been absorbed and the couscous is tender. Fluff up the couscous with a fork.Press the couscous into a lightly oiled ramekin, and turn out onto a serving plate. Garnish with the basil leaves and serve.
