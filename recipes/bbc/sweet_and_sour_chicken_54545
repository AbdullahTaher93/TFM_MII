First prepare the chicken, shred it thinly into 3–4mm thick pieces and place in a bowl (this is easier if you semi-freeze the chicken breast first). Alternatively, cut the chicken into 1cm/½in cubes.Heat the oil in a large wok. Mix the rest of the chicken ingredients with the chicken until the chicken is well coated with batter. When oil is hot, fry the chicken on a very high heat in batches to prevent the pieces clumping together. This will only take a minute or so if using cubes of chicken, even less if using shredded. Place the cooked chicken on a plate lined with kitchen paper and set aside.To make the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan. When hot, add the spring onions, peppers, carrot and ginger, keeping the heat high and stirring slowly. When the peppers start to brown, mix in the cucumber and pineapple, then add the stock.Mix the cornflour with a little water to make a paste. When the stock boils, add the sugar, vinegar, tomato purée, onions and tomatoes. Once the liquid comes to the boil, gently pour in the cornflour batter and stir continuously until the liquid thickens. Check the seasoning again and remove from the heat. Add the coriander leaves, if using.For the rice, heat a wok and once hot add the oil. Add the rice and cook for 1–2 minutes. Add the eggs and soy sauce and cook for a further 3–4 minutes or until the rice is piping hot. Finish with salt and pepper, but remember not too much salt as the soy sauce will season the dish.To serve, mix the chicken into the sauce. Pile rice into a small bowl and turn out onto each serving plate to make a neat mound of rice. Arrange the curry around the outside and serve immediately.
