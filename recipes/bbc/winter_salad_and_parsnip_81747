For the parsnip nests, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the parsnips and plenty of salt and pepper, then fry for a few minutes, until wilted down and slightly softened – this helps get rid of some of the volume. Leave to cool completely, then mix with the egg.Grease a 12-hole fairy cake tin or a four-hole Yorkshire pudding tin with oil. Strain the parsnips to get rid of any excess egg – you want them just coated to hold them together, not swimming in it.Divide the mixture between the holes, pressing down the centre and pushing up the sides to create nest shapes. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the parsnips are crisp and brown. Leave in the tins for a few minutes before removing.To make the salad, put the chicory, cabbage and drained red onion in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.To make the dressing, whisk the dressing ingredients together and season. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss. Garnish with the toasted hazelnuts.Serve the parsnip nests with the salad.
