Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Using a sharp knife, cut a pocket halfway into the chicken breast. Stuff the cheese into the pocket and wrap the chicken in the streaky bacon, to seal up the pocket.Heat an ovenproof frying pan and, when hot, add the wrapped chicken breast and fry for two minutes on each side, until the bacon is golden but not crisp. Transfer to the oven and cook for five minutes, or until completely cooked through. (You will know the chicken is cooked when if pierced the juices run clear.)To make the potato tower, place a 5cm/2in greased chefs' ring onto a clean work surface. Add alternate layers of potato and cheese, seasoning well with salt and freshly ground black pepper between each layer.Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Carefully lift the chefs' ring and add to the pan. Cook for two minutes on each side, then transfer to the oven and bake for 12 minutes.To serve, push the potato and cheese tower out of the chefs' ring onto a plate and serve the chicken alongside.
