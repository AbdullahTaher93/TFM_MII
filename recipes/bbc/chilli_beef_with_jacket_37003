Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Rub the potatoes with 2 teaspoons oil and season with salt and pepper. Prick them all over with a fork. Bake for 45–60 minutes, or until crisp on the outside and fluffy inside.Meanwhile, mix the spices together in a medium bowl. Remove 2 teaspoons of the spice mix and set aside. Add the steak to the bowl and toss to coat.Heat a large frying pan until very hot. Add the remaining oil and the beef and fry for 30–40 seconds on each side, until browned and just cooked, then tip onto a plate and set aside.Add the onion and pepper to the pan, cover with a lid and gently fry for 2–3 minutes, until just softened. Add the garlic, chilli and reserved spice mix and fry for another 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 4–5 minutes, until tender and the sauce is slightly reduced. Add the beef and any juices and cook for another minute, until cooked and hot through. Season with salt and pepper then stir in the coriander.When the potatoes are tender, cut them in half lengthways and divide between the serving plates. Spoon the chilli beef over the top, then finish with a dollop of sour cream, some grated cheese and a few jalapeno slices.
