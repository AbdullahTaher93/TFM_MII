Stir through the herbs, lemon zest and Cheddar.Beat the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon of cold water in a bowl. Add to the flour mixture and combine until it forms a dough, adding more cold water if needed. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge while you make the filling.To make the filling, put the garlic in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 2–3 minutes, then drain.Wipe the saucepan dry. Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon of olive oil and fry over a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the vinegar and 100ml/3½fl oz water, bring to the boil and simmer gently for 10 minutes.Add the honey, most of the rosemary and thyme (reserving the rest, with the sage) and a good pinch of salt. Cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated and the garlic is coated in a dark syrup.Meanwhile, put the celeriac in a saucepan, cover with freshly boiled water and boil for 7–10 minutes, or until soft and slightly translucent. Drain and tip into a big mixing bowl.Add the cheeses, crème fraiche, lemon juice, mustard, parsley, Worcestershire sauce and eggs. Add a good pinch of salt and grind of pepper and gently fold in the garlic.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Sprinkle flour onto a clean work surface and roll out the pastry to 3-4mm thick. Line a 20cm/8in round cake tin with the pastry, ensuring a little spills over the edges. Pour the filling into the pastry case. Coarsely grate the reserved celeriac and pile it on top. Finish with the reserved rosemary, thyme, sage and a drizzle of olive oil.Bake for 45 minutes, or until the tart filling has set and the top is golden brown. Leave to cool a little, then take it out of the tin. Serve warm with a few herbs sprinkled over.
