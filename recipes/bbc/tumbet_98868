Preheat the oven to 200C/Fan 180C/Gas 6.Arrange the aubergine slices on a large baking tray and brush with olive oil. Season with salt. Roast for 20–25 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.Pour a 5mm/¼in thick layer of olive oil in the base of a large, heavy-based frying pan. Fry the courgettes on a medium heat, for a couple of minutes on each side, then remove and drain onto kitchen towel. Season lightly with salt.Add the potato slices to the frying pan and fry on both sides until they are softened all the way through and a very light golden colour around the edges. This will take up to 10 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.To make the sauce, put the olive oil in a saucepan and add the garlic. Cook for 3–4 minutes on a low–medium heat until soft and aromatic, then add the tomatoes and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and cook gently, uncovered, until well reduced – around 25 minutes. Taste after 10 minutes – if the sauce tastes acidic, add a pinch of sugar.Reduce the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.To assemble, spread a couple of tablespoons of tomato sauce in the base of an oven dish. Sprinkle over some fresh oregano and basil leaves. Top with all the aubergines.Add more tomato sauce, then sprinkle with more herbs and add the courgettes. Repeat with more tomato sauce, more herbs and the peppers, then finish with the last of the tomato sauce and herbs, and top with the potatoes.Sprinkle over more salt and pepper and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Bake in the oven for 25–30 minutes, or until the potatoes are crisp and browned and the vegetables underneath are tender.
