Heat the oil in a large, heavy bottomed, non-stick saucepan. Add the whole spices (cinnamon, bay leaves, cardamom, star anise and fenugreek seeds) and heat gently, swirling in the oil to release the flavours. Add the salt.Stir in the onions, garlic and ginger pastes, continuing to stir and cook on a medium heat until the onions are soft and just starting to colour. Add the meat and brown all over in the spice and onion mixture, this will take approximately 10 minutes.Add enough water to fully cover the meat (approximately 750ml/1¼ pint). Stir and bring to the boil before reducing the heat and simmering uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring frequently.Add a generous pinch of shatkora or orange rind slices (around 6-8 little slithers) to the pan and stir. Add the chilli powder, turmeric, coriander, cumin and garam masala. Stir in the tomato purèe. Add a little more water, cover with a lid and cook on a gentle simmer for 1½–2 hours, or until the meat is tender.  Remove the lid for the last 10 minutes to reduce and thicken the sauce.Finally add the tomato wedges and a handful of coriander and simmer for a few minutes before serving. Serve with rice and your choice of garnishes.
