Peel, core and thinly slice the apples. Place in a large pan with the garlic and vinegar. Cook gently until the apples have broken down into a thick pur√©e. Stir in the sugar, dates, sultanas, ginger, salt and spices. Cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.Spoon into hot, sterilised, glass preserving jars with clip tops. To enjoy the chutney at its best, store in a cool, dark, dry place for about 2-3 weeks before eating. This allows time for the flavours to mature. Once a jar has been opened, store in the fridge and eat within 1 month.
