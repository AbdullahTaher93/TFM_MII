For the polenta and Parmesan chips, line a baking tray with baking parchment.Bring 570ml/1 pint of water to the boil in a large saucepan. Gradually whisk in the polenta and then the butter. Finish with the cheese and salt. Pour into the lined baking tray and leave to set in the fridge for at least an hour.Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Cut the polenta into chip shapes. Deep-fry for 3–5 minutes or until golden and crisp. Place on a plate with kitchen roll to drain off the excess fat.For the beef, crush all the peppercorns in a pestle and mortar. Press the pepper into the steaks. Heat a frying pan, add the butter and cook the steaks to your liking. Remove the steaks from the pan and leave to rest.In the same pan, make the sauce. Cook the shallots for 2 minutes. Pour in the brandy and scrape off the cooked on bits. Cook until the brandy has reduced in volume by at least a half. Finish with the crème fraîche.For the salad, mix the leaves in a bowl. Whisk the oil and the vinegar together in a small bowl. Just before serving pour the dressing over the leaves and toss together.Serve the steaks with the sauce poured over, with the polenta chips and dressed salad.
