Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Turn off the oven. Scoop out the flesh from the sweet potatoes into a large bowl.Put half of the black beans into a food processor with the walnuts and blend until smooth. Add to the sweet potato flesh, with the remaining black beans, paprika, dried herb mix, garlic powder and onion powder. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Divide the mixture into four portions and shape into logs, about 15 x 7 x 2cm/6 x 2¾ x ¾in on the lined tray. Flatten them slightly and chill in the fridge to firm up for 2 hours.Heat the oven again to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.

When the patties are cooked, place the tortillas in the oven for one minute until warm, but still pliable.Spread each tortilla with a big spoonful of the chipotle yoghurt and place a sweet potato patty in the middle. Top with lettuce, carrot and beetroot. Slice an avocado quarter in half and lay both pieces on top, then roll the tortilla around the filling tightly. Slice in half and serve.
