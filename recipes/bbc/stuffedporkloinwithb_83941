Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.Place the cornflour, egg and sesame oil into a bowl and whisk together to create a thick batter.Using a sharp knife, make an incision into all three of the pieces of pork to create a pocket in each and set aside.In a bowl mix together the herbs, spring onion and cheese. Stuff a little of this cheese mixture into the pocket in each of the pork slices.Dip the stuffed pork pieces into the batter mixture and then dip into a bowl of the breadcrumbs to coat thoroughly.Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and when hot add the breadcrumbed pork pieces and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown all over.Transfer the pork into the oven and cook for 7-10 minutes or until completely cooked through.
