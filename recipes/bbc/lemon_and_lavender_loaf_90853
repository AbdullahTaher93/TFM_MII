Pour this onto the dry ingredients and, using a spatula, stir until just combined.Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.Remove the cake from the oven and prick it deeply all over with a cocktail stick.Mix the ingredients for the drizzle together and pour over the hot cake. Sprinkle over the granulated sugar and then the lavender. Leave to cool completely in the tin before slicing.
