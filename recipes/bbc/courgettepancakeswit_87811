Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.For the tomato sauce, heat the oil in a heavy-based ovenproof pan. Add the onion and garlic and fry gently for a few minutes until softened, but not coloured.Add the tomatoes and balsamic vinegar, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Stir well, then transfer to the oven for 6-8 minutes, until the sauce is slightly reduced and thickened.For the pancakes, sift the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt.Make a well in the centre and break in the eggs. Gradually whisk together, adding the milk a little at a time to make a smooth batter.Grate the courgettes and stir into the batter.Heat the oil in a frying pan and add spoonfuls of the courgette batter. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until tiny bubbles begin to form on the surface and the underside of the pancakes are lightly golden. Turn over and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until cooked through and lightly golden.To serve, place the courgette pancakes onto warmed plates and spoon over the tomato sauce.
