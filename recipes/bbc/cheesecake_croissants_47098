Preheat the oven to 200C/180C/Gas 6 and have a 12-hole muffin tray at the ready (to give the six croissants room!)Put the ricotta in a bowl and whisk to loosen, then add the sugar and vanilla (if using) and mix really well. Add the raspberries and give them a stir, so that they don’t break up too much, but bleed enough to give that lovely marbled effect.Add the flour and egg to the remaining mixture and mix really well.Cut each croissant horizontally, the way you would cut them if you were going to butter and jam them, but not all the way through. Open each croissant up and fit them inside the cavities of your muffin tray – you are aiming for what looks like a croissant shell cup. You might need to press lightly, to open the cavity. Do this to all 6 croissants, then fill with the ricotta mixture.Bake in the oven for 15 minutes – there should be a gentle wobble in the centre. These are delicious eaten straightaway, but equally delicious chilled from the fridge if you have any left over. They will keep for 3 days in the fridge.If you plan on freezing them, pop them into a freezer bag (if you have several, freeze them uncovered on a tray for an hour first, then pop into a freezer bag).
