Generously butter the inside of two 1.2 litre/2 pint pudding basins.Spoon 100g/3½oz of the golden syrup into the base of the pudding basins and set aside.Beat the remaining 100g/3½oz golden syrup, butter, sugar and lemon zest together in a large bowl until light and fluffy.Beat in half the eggs followed by half the flour and when well combined, add the remaining eggs and flour. The mixture should be at a just dropping consistency. (Add a splash of milk if the mixture is very thick.)Spoon the mixture into the pudding basins until three-quarters full, then smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.Loosely cover with clingfilm (allow room for the clingfilm to inflate as the mixture rises) and place in the microwave for five minutes. (Cook one pudding at a time.)The pudding is done when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to stand for five minutes. Run a blunt knife around the edge of the pudding to loosen the sides, carefully invert onto a deep plate and remove the basin.To serve, spoon the extra syrup over the pudding, cut into generous wedges and serve with custard.
