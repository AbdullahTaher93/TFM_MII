Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Roll the pastry out to a 0.25cm/⅛in thickness and cut out 24 circles from it using a 5cm/2in pastry cutter.Place the circles onto a baking tray and prick all over with a fork.Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until cooked through and golden-brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the tomatoes, thyme leaves, bay leaf, garlic and crushed peppercorns. Fry gently for 4-5 minutes, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Remove the bay leaf and garlic.Blend the sundried tomatoes and olives to a paste in a food processor, then stir in the basil and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To assemble the canapés, spread a little of the olive paste onto each pastry circle and top with a spoonful of tomato confit.
