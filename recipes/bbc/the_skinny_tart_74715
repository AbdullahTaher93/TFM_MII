Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 with the middle shelf ready. Grease a 12-hole muffin tin or cupcake tin well.Cut the filo pastry into squares that are big enough to fit into the muffin holes and hang over the sides a little. Brush each piece of filo with lots of melted butter to stop it from burning in the oven, then push a filo square into eight of the holes and top with another filo square, you will need to layer up 3â€“4 pieces.Place the filo cases into the oven for five minutes or so, giving them time to crisp up. Once they look golden-brown and crispy, remove them from the oven and leave to cool for 10 minutes or so. Remove them from the muffin tray and place them on serving dishes. I always tend to break at least one when I take them out!Put the jam in a small pan and heat gently until warm.Mix the Greek yoghurt, honey and vanilla together in a bowl, then place a good dollop into each pastry case. Divide the fruit among the tartlets, piling it up high. Brush with the warm apricot jam to make a shiny glaze and serve.
