For the tart, place the gooseberries, lychees, wine, orange zest, vanilla pod and sugar in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over a low heat. Cook gently for 10–15 minutes, or until soft but not broken down completely. Leave to cool.For the crumble, preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking paper. Place the polenta, butter, sugar, flour and almonds in a large mixing bowl and rub together until it forms a breadcrumb texture. Scatter the mixture over the baking tray and bake for 15–20 minutes, or until golden. Remove and leave to cool.Strain most of the cooked fruit thoroughly in a colander. Fill the pastry case with the fruit and sprinkle over the crumble topping.Ripple the dulce de leche through the cream and serve alongside slices of the crumble tart, with the remaining fruit scattered with the mint and dusted with icing sugar.
