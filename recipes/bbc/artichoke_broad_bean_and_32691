First prepare the globe artichokes. Put the lemon juice or vinegar in a bowl of cold water. Remove the stem of the artichoke to within 1cm/½in of the base. Peel off the outer leaves until you reach the pale coloured centre. Cut the body of the artichoke in half horizontally. Remove the hairy choke with a teaspoon. Pare off any remaining outer leaves with a sharp knife. Cut into six wedges and put them into the lemon water to stop them going brown.Heat the stock in a saucepan.Melt the half the butter with the olive oil in a wide pan over medium-low heat and sweat the onion and garlic for 5–10 minutes until soft.Add the rice and stir well to coat the grains. Add the white wine and stir until it has been absorbed by the rice. Start adding the vegetable stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until it is absorbed, which will take about 20 minutes. The rice should be cooked through but retain bite (you may not need all of the stock).After about 12 minutes, bring a pot of water to the boil, add the artichoke and cook for 5–7 minutes until tender. Remove and set aside. Add the broad beans and peas and boil for about 3 minutes, then drain. Add all the vegetables to the risotto and heat through.Remove from the heat and stir through the lemon zest, juice and remaining butter. Season with salt, pepper and half the pecorino. Serve immediately with the remaining pecorino.
