For the chorizo, place all of the ingredients, except the sausage skins, into a bowl and mix until well combined.Press the sausage meat into a manual sausage machine and press down.Place a sausage skin over the end of the nozzle and turn the handle.Turn until the skins are all filled, then remove from the nozzle.Twist the sausage at 30cm/12in intervals to form individual sausages then prick carefully with a toothpick to release any air pockets.Hang in a cool dry place for at least  one month, preferably up to three months.
