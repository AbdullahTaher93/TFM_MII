For the marinade, place all the ingredients in a food processor and blitz together until smooth. Coat the chicken, cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least two hours, but preferably overnight.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Wipe off the excess marinade and rub with oil. Griddle or barbecue the chicken, breast side down, until the skin starts to char and goes golden brown. Be very careful not to let it burn as it will very easily.Place the chicken onto a baking tray and roast for 35 minutes,  in the oven or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the leg, between the drumstick and the thigh, is pierced with a skewer and the chicken is cooked.Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes, then carve the chicken into 10 pieces.
