Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.Heat the oil in a large frying pan and gently fry the onion for 5 minutes or until softened, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly.Tip the onion and garlic into a large bowl and add the mince, 150g/5½ oz of the breadcrumbs, the marjoram, caraway seeds, salt and pepper. Mix everything well with clean hands, then add the beaten eggs and mix again. Form the mixture into a rough ball.Place the ball in the centre of a sturdy roasting tin and shape it into a long loaf, about 4cm/1½ in high. Sprinkle the reserved breadcrumbs on top and pat them lightly into the outside of the loaf. Pour 300ml/10fl oz/½ pint of the beef stock around the base of the meatloaf.Bake in the centre of the oven for 20 minutes, then pour the remaining stock into the tin and return to the oven for 10 minutes until cooked through. Transfer the meatloaf carefully to a warmed serving platter and cover loosely with foil.Place the roasting tin over a medium heat and simmer for a few minutes until the juices are well reduced – you should have about 100ml/3½fl oz of liquid in the tin. Stir in the soured cream and warm through gently, stirring constantly, then season to taste with salt and pepper.Strain the sauce through a sieve into a small jug.Garnish the meatloaf with some fresh marjoram sprigs, if you have some, and serve with the hot sauce.
