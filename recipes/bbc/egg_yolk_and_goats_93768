Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.To make the ravioli, bake the potatoes for 45 minutes – 1 hour, or until soft. Set aside to cool a little. Remove the skin and mash. Season with salt and pepper.Mix together the mash and goats’ cheese in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the olive oil and thyme.Place a large spoonful of the mixture onto a pasta sheet. Using the back of the spoon, make a deep well in the potato. Place an egg yolk into the well and gently place a second layer of pasta over the top. Brush egg wash around the edges and press down around the filling, ensuring it is well sealed and there are no air pockets. Repeat with the remaining pasta sheets and filling.Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Blanch the ravioli, one at a time, for 2 minutes or until the pasta is al dente.Meanwhile, place the carrots in a saucepan and add enough water to just cover them. Add the butter and bring to a simmer. Cook until glazed and soft. Add the smoked paprika and season with salt and pepper.To make the goats’ cheese cream, beat the cheese with the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and, if necessary, add a little double cream to make a soft spooning consistency.To serve, spoon a generous amount of the soft cheese onto the base of a dish. Drizzle over a little olive oil. Place the carrots between the plates, garnish with watercress and top with the ravioli.
