Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Toss in the onions and cook for 10 minutes, or until they are golden-brown, adding a splash of water to the pan if they begin to stick. Add the garlic and ginger with a splash of water, stir well and cook for 1 minute. Add the spices with some salt and pepper and cook for another minute.Stir in the tomato purée and cook for a further minute, then tip in the tinned tomatoes and pour in 300ml/10fl oz of water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for 5–10 minutes. Add the chopped peppers and cook for a further 5 minutes, then remove from the heat.Take the chicken out of the oven. Carefully wave a cook’s blowtorch over the surface until the marinade has slightly blackened in places. Set aside for 10 minutes.For the katchumber salad, mix everything together in a bowl and set aside.Take the chicken breasts off the bone and cut the meat into chunks, about 2.5cm/1in. Reheat the curry sauce, then add the chicken and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the pieces are cooked through.Stir through the yoghurt and chopped coriander.
