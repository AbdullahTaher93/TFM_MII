Brush the basil pesto over the meat before seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Once cooked, remove from the oven and cover with aluminium foil. Leave to rest for 20 minutes.For the minted potatoes, bring a large pan of water to the boil.

Return the potatoes to the pan, add the butter and chopped mint and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, carve the lamb and place onto serving plates along with the minted new potatoes.
