Mix well, then lightly dust the chicken strips with the cornflour.Heat a wok until smoking and add the groundnut oil, then add the chicken and stir fry for 3–4 minutes, or until the chicken is golden-brown and cooked through.Add the red pepper and stir fry for 1 minute, then add the bean sprouts and spring onion and stir fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the cooked noodles and season with the soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil and freshly ground black pepper.Pile the noodles onto a serving plate and serve immediately.
