Cook over a high heat for 2-3 minutes and then add the rice. If at this point the mixture is drying out add a splash of olive oil. Fry the mixture for 2-3 minutes until the rice is slightly translucent.Add the wine and simmer until the liquid is mostly absorbed, then add a ladleful of stock.Continue to cook the rice, adding a ladleful of stock at a time and stirring continuously until the liquid is absorbed by the rice.
