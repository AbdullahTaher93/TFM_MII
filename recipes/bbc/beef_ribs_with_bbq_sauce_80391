Create four small piles of sea salt in a baking tray then place the potatoes on top. Bake for 1-1½ hours, or until tender.Meanwhile, make the bbq sauce. Heat a sauté pan until hot and add the butter, onions and garlic and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until softened.Add the chillies, fennel seeds, star anise and sugar. Cook for a further 3-4 minutes until the sugar has dissolved.Add the ketchups and soy sauce and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes, or until thickened.Remove from the heat and cool slightly before placing in a blender. Pulse to form a smooth pureé.Dip the ribs into the sauce then place into a roasting tray and spoon some more sauce over the top.
