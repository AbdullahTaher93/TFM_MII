Line a baking tray with baking paper. Insert the wooden lolly sticks into the apples and set aside in the fridge. Unwrap all the toffees and put them in a medium saucepan with 4 tablespoons water.Heat the toffees gently over a medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until they dissolve. Eventually the toffees and the water will make a smooth sauce. Increase the heat to medium-high and boil the toffee sauce for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and stir in the sea salt flakes.Pour the caramel into a heatproof bowl and allow it to cool for one minute. Have any decorations ready in a small bowl nearby.Dip the apples into the hot caramel and allow the excess to run off. Hold the apple upside down for 30 seconds or so until the caramel has cooled slightly - this prevents it all running to the bottom. Dip the apples into the bowl of decorations, if using. Set the apple aside to cool completely on the lined baking tray. Repeat with the remaining apples.For a less sweet toffee apple, use a spoon to drizzle each apple with caramel, rotating it so it swirls round the outside. Allow the caramel to harden slightly before you put it down onto the lined tray. You will make more toffee apples this way.
