Pat your fish dry as much as possible using kitchen paper – this will stop the fish spitting when you fry it. Put the fish in a bowl and add about 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, all the spices, salt and pepper. Give everything a good mix so that the fish is coated in the spice mix.Heat 5 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large non-stick frying pan until it is smoking hot then add the marinated fish. Don’t move it around in the pan, just let it fry for 3 minutes on each side. Once cooked, remove the fish from the pan and place on kitchen paper to drain.Add the mustard seeds to the same pan set over a medium heat. The seeds will start to pop – at this point add the onions and chillies. Turn down the heat and cook them gently until they are soft and starting to caramelise, then add the salt and coriander.Spread the onions out on a serving platter and top with the fried fish. Serve immediately.
