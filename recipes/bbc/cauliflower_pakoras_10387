Preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Mix together the flour, salt, cumin, fennel seeds, chilli, cauliflower and almond milk in a bowl. Set aside for 15 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse.When the oil is hot, carefully lower tablespoons of the batter mixture in batches into the oil and fry for 5â€“6 minutes, or until the pakoras are crisp and golden-brown and the vegetables have cooked through. (You should get 12 pakoras from the mixture).Put the coconut milk and stock into a large pan and grate in the turmeric. Heat gently until small bubbles start to appear on the surface.To serve, ladle the coconut milk into four serving bowls and drop three pakoras into each. Drizzle with the chilli and coriander oils, top with the chilli and coriander and serve immediately.
