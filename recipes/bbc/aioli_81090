Blend all ingredients, except the olive oil, in a food processor. Pour the oil into the blender in a steady stream, until it forms a thick sauce. The mixture, once blended, should be vibrant and yellow in colour. To vary the flavour, add a little mustard or some saffron. If you'd like your mayonnaise runnier, add a couple of tablespoons of hot water.Serve with baguette slices and/or a selection of raw vegetables, such as celery, carrot sticks, cucumber sticks, radishes, strips of fennel, strips of pepper, cherry tomatoes.
