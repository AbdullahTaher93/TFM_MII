Bring 1.5 litres/2¾ pints water to the boil in a large saucepan. Add the pork belly slices and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the pork and drain well, then pat dry with kitchen paper and cut into 2cm/¾in x 2cm/¾in pieces.Heat a wok over a medium heat, add the rapeseed oil and give the oil a swirl. Add the pork pieces and brown for 2 minutes, then add the ginger, rice wine, star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, dried chillies, chicken stock, dark soy sauce, brown sugar and salt. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook over a medium heat for 45 minutes, until the liquid has reduced and thickened slightly and is a glossy reddish-brown colour.Remove from the heat and serve with steamed jasmine rice and stir-fried greens.
