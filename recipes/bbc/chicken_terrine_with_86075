Mince the chicken, ham, pork and veal twice in a mincer using a medium-sized mincer blade disc. Alternatively, chop the meat into tiny pieces with a sharp knife.Put the minced meat into a well-chilled bowl, set on a larger bowl of ice and stir with a wooden spoon until well combined.Stir in the cream, egg, Armagnac or Cognac (if using), thyme and white wine until well combined.Add the salt and season to taste with freshly ground black pepper. This is called the farce.Heat 40g/1Â½oz of the butter in a small saucepan and fry the shallots for 2-3 minutes, then set aside to cool. Stir in the herbs.Melt the remaining butter in a small saucepan and remove from the heat.Dip the chicken breast strips in the melted butter, then dip in the shallot and herb mixture until well coated. Set aside on a plate.Line the terrines with strips of pork fat.Spread half of the farce in the bottom of the terrines, then add a layer of chicken breast strips, top with the remaining farce, then more slices of pork fat.Cover with the lid and chill in the fridge for 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.Place the terrines into a large baking tray and half-fill the baking tray with boiling water.Cook the terrines for 30 minutes uncovered, then cover with the lids and cook for a further 15 minutes.Remove the terrines from the oven, remove the lids and place a weighted board (maximum weight 250g/9oz) onto the terrines to compress them gently until they have completely cooled.  Leave to chill in the fridge.Serve with toasted crusty bread.
