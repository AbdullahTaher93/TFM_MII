Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5 and line a baking tray with parchment.Mix together the butter, mace, dill, currants, ginger, salt and pepper in a bowl to make a paste. Place one piece of salmon on a clean work surface, smear the paste on top and lay the other fillet on top of the paste.Cut the pastry in half and roll out each piece to about 2cm/Â¾ wider than the size of the salmon. Place one piece of pastry on the lined baking tray and lay the salmon on top. Dab water around the edge of the pastry, then lay the other piece of pastry on top. Press the edges together lightly to seal.Glaze the top of the parcel with the beaten egg and crimp the edges to finish. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes and then brush with egg again. Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden-brown.For the butter sauce place the vinegar, white wine and shallots into a saucepan and cook until reduced in volume by half. Gradually whisk in the butter until a smooth sauce is formed. Season with salt and pepper.Cut the salmon into slices and serve with the butter sauce.
