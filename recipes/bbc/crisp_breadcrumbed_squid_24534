For the squid, heat a deep fat fryer to 190C/375F. Alternatively heat vegetable oil in a deep-sided, heavy based pan, until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Season the flour with salt and black pepper.Dredge the squid rings with the seasoned flour, coating thoroughly.Dip the floured squid rings into the beaten eggs then straight into the breadcrumbs to coat.Lower a few squid rings at a time into the fat fryer, or hot oil, and cook for two minutes until golden-brown and crisp.Remove the squid rings from the hot oil with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen paper.For the creamy ponzu dressing, place all the ingredients, except the vegetable oil, into a small food processor and blend to a pur√©e.Gradually add in the vegetable oil until a thin mayonnaise forms.Check the seasoning and add more yuzu juice if desired.For the Chinese leaf salad, mix together the Chinese leaf, red onion and mint in a bowl.Whisk the rice wine vinegar, sesame and vegetable oils together with the lime juice then season to taste.Pour the dressing over the leaves and mix well.To serve, pile the squid onto a plate and drizzle over the creamy ponzu dressing then pile the salad alongside.
