Cook the egg noodles in a pan of boiling water with a pinch of salt, over a mediumâ€“high heat according to packet instructions, until tender.Meanwhile, whisk together the hoisin, soy sauce and sesame oil to make the sauce. You might want to add an extra half tablespoon of soy sauce, depending on how much salt there is in the hoisin sauce.Remove the noodles from the heat and add the spinach to the pan.While the spinach is wilting, dry fry the eggs in a non-stick frying pan over a high heat, taking care to ensure the eggs do not burn.Drain the noodles and spinach well before returning them to the pan. Stir in the sauce and the spring onions. The spinach should contain enough residual water to help the sauce cover the noodles, but you can always add more of the reserved cooking water for a looser sauce. However, be careful not to make it too watery.Divide the noodles between two bowls and top each with a fried egg. Sprinkle over the sesame seeds before serving, if using.
