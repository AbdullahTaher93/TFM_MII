Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan. Cover with boiling water and simmer for 35–50 minutes, or until tender to the tip of a knife.Remove from the heat, drain and leave to cool. Peel off the skins and discard. Grate the potatoes into a large bowl, crack in the eggs and add the beef, onion and spices. Season well and mix with your hands.Divide the mixture into 20 balls, then flatten and shape each one into a teardrop.Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat.Combine the flour and sesame seeds on a plate. Coat each kotlet in the floury mixture, shaking off any excess, then fry in batches for 3–4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper.To make the salad, mix all the ingredients together. Serve alongside the kotlets.
