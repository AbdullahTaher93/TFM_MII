Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 6. Lightly butter and line a 23cm/9in square cake tin with baking paper.For the biscuit base, put the flour, butter and salt in a food processor and pulse to a fine crumb. Add the coconut and sugar and pulse again. Beat the egg yolk with the vanilla and 1–2 tablespoons cold water and add to the food processor with the motor running, to make a soft dough. Press into the prepared tin and flatten using the back of a spoon, pushing the mixture evenly into all the corners. Prick the base using a fork, then cover and chill in the fridge for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, for the jam, put the raspberries and sugar in a saucepan and heat until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to the boil for 5 minutes, or until it reaches the setting point.Bake the biscuit base for 15 minutes, or until pale golden-brown. Leave to cool for 2 minutes, then spread with the jam.For the cake, melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Remove from the heat and use a fork to beat in the yoghurt, then the eggs and reserved egg white.Sift the flour, salt and baking powder into a large bowl and stir in the sugar and coconut.Pour the wet cake ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix well. Pour over the jammy base, level the top with the back of a spoon and scatter with the berries and flaked almonds. Bake for 40–45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin, then turn out and cut into bars.
