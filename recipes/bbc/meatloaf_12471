Heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas4.Place all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix thoroughly - it s best to use your hands here.Transfer the mix to a 900g/2lb loaf tin and pat down until level. Cover the top of the mixture with an oiled piece of greaseproof paper.Bake in the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes or until the meatloaf is cooked through. (Remove the paper 15 minutes before the end of cooking).
