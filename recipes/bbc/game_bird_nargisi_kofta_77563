Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and cook the eggs for 6 minutes. Transfer to iced water. Once cool enough to handle peel off the shells.Put the remaining kofta ingredients in a food processor and blitz until you have a fine mince. (You may need to do this twice.) Set aside.To make the curry sauce, heat the oil in a casserole dish over a medium heat and fry the onions for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are a rich dark brown.Add the remaining sauce ingredients to a blender and blitz until smooth.Pour the sauce into the onions and bring to a simmer for 2â€“3 minutes, stirring continuously. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook for 15 minutes, until the sauce has the consistency of double cream. Stir from time to time to prevent the bottom of the pan from catching.Meanwhile, divide the kofta mince into six equal portions and work each ball with your hands until soft and supple. Flatten the mince in your palm and place an egg in the middle. Enclose the mince around the egg to form a kofta, making sure no open edges are exposed. Repeat with the remaining kofta mix and eggs.Shallow fry the koftas in a large frying pan to seal the mince.Add the koftas to the sauce and simmer for a few minutes until cooked through. (No longer otherwise the eggs will be overcooked.) Sprinkle with the coriander and serve.
