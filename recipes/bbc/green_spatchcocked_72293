Preheat the oven to its highest setting, or at least 240C/220C Fan/Gas 8.Blend two-thirds of the coriander, mint and basil leaves in a food processor. Add 5 of the garlic cloves, all of the ginger, and 3 of the chillies and blend to a fine paste. Add the yoghurt and blend again. Add the zest and juice of 3 of the limes and blend until smooth. Set this marinade aside.Season the spatchcocked chicken really well on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Lay it in a roasting tray, skin side up. Rub the marinade all over the chicken using your hands. If you have time, cover and place in the fridge to marinate for 1 hour; otherwise cook straight away.Roast the chicken in the oven for 40-45 minutes, or until cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced in the thickest part of the thigh with a sharp knife and no trace of pink remains.)Meanwhile, grind the remaining coriander, mint and basil to a paste using a pestle and mortar. Season with a large pinch of salt. Add the remaining chilli and garlic and grind again to a smooth paste. Stir in the soy and fish sauces, sesame oil and honey until well combined. Add the zest and juice of the remaining 2 limes and grind once more.Mix the cabbage and onion in a bowl, drizzle over the dressing and toss to coat. Tip the salad onto a serving platter. Carve the cooked chicken into chunks and arrange them on top of the salad to serve.
