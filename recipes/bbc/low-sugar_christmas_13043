Crack in the egg and add the vanilla extract, then beat again.Mix in the flour, cinnamon and candied peel until the mixture comes together as a dough.Roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of 1cm/Â½in.Using biscuit cutters or a glass, cut biscuits out of the dough and carefully place onto the baking tray. Decorate with the almond halves. To make into Christmas tree decorations, carefully make a hole in the top of the biscuit using a straw.Bake the biscuits for 8-10 minutes until deep golden-brown.
