Melt the butter in a wide, heavy-based, lidded pan over a low heat. When the butter is foaming, add the sage and fry one minute.Add the butternut squash pieces and chilli flakes. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the squash is tender, stirring occasionally.Lightly mash the squash, using a fork, then stir in the parmesan and crème fraîche until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
