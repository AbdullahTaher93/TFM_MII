To make the mayonnaise, blanch the watercress in a large saucepan of boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain and refresh under cold running water until completely cool. Squeeze out any excess water. Blend the watercress in a bowl with the remaining ingredients plus salt and freshly ground black pepper, using a hand-held blender, until you have a smooth mayonnaise.Preheat a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Season the squid with salt and pepper and drizzle with the oil, then cook on the hot griddle for 2 minutes (it should curl and go dark and sticky on the outside). Turn the squid and cook for a further minute.Meanwhile, mix half the lemon juice with the red chillies. Remove the griddle from the heat and pour the lemon and chilli mixture over the squid.To serve, put a handful of rocket and watercress on each of four plates. Place the squid on top, pour over the remaining lemon juice and serve with a spoonful of mayonnaise.
