Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Place the eggs, orange zest, flour, baking powder and milk into a large bowl and whisk together to form a smooth batter.Heat the butter and oil in a shallow frying pan over a medium heat.Ladle a quarter of the batter mixture to the pan to make a large thick pancake. Cook for one minute on each side, until golden.Transfer to a baking sheet and repeat the pancake-making process to cook three more pancakes.Once you have four pancakes placed on the baking sheet, place into the oven to bake for two minutes.To serve, stack the pancakes onto a warm plate and dust with icing sugar. Arrange the orange segments around the plate and drizzle the pancakes with maple syrup.
