Put the chicken breast in a small pan (it needs to be a small pan so the chicken poaches in the milk). Add the milk, onion and bay leaf. Cover with a lid and simmer gently for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Divide the pastry into two equal rectangles and carefully roll them out until large enough to cover the top of two individual pie dishes. Place the upturned pie dishes on the pastry and cut around them to make the pie lids. Cut any excess pastry into strips and press them around the top edge of the pie dishes (this will help the lids stay in place as the pies bake). Cut a cross in the middle of the pastry lids and set aside.Fry the bacon with one squirt of spray oil in a non-stick pan. When golden-brown, add the mushrooms and a tablespoon of water. Cook for 2-3 minutes then add the leeks. Cook for about 5 minutes breaking up the leeks as they soften.Remove the chicken from the poaching milk. Strain and reserve the milk and chop the chicken into bite-sized pieces.Stir the chicken into the vegetables. Add the flour and stir well. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the strained poaching milk stirring well to incorporate. Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened just a little. Divide between the pie dishes.Brush the pastry edges with a little milk and add the pie lids. Brush all over with more milk. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the pastry lid is golden-brown. Serve immediately with steamed broccoli.
