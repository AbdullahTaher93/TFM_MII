You may need to cover with foil if it's getting too brown.Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 30 minutes, before removing onto a wire rack and leaving to cool completely .To decorate, remove the baking paper and place the cake on a gold cake board. Brush with the apricot jam.Lightly dust a work surface with a little icing sugar and roll out the marzipan to a cirlce slightly bigger than the cake. Cover and smooth over the surface and sides. Brush with a light sprinkling of water.Lightly dust a work suface with a little icing sugar. Roll out the gold icing to a circle slightly bigger than the cake. Cover the marzipan and smooth the surface. Trim the excess icing, (reserve this for later) then tuck under the cake.
