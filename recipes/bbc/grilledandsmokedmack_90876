Cover the steamer with a tight fitting lid.Reduce the heat and cook for 4-7 minutes (depending on the size of the mackerel), or until just cooked through. Remove and set aside.

Make sure you work in a well-ventilated area.)Preheat the grill to hot.Place the remaining mackerel fillets, skin-side down, onto a clean work surface, season with freshly ground black pepper and spread over one tablespoon of the fresh horseradish and the remaining olive oil.Place the mackerel skin-side up onto a grill tray and cook under the grill for 3-4 minutes, or until cooked through.Place the double cream into a bowl, add half of the lemon juice and salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Whisk until thickened. Add the remaining horseradish and stir to combine. Set aside.Place the remaining lemon juice, white wine vinegar and rapeseed oil into another bowl and whisk together. Add the herbs and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, place one fillet of smoked mackerel at the top of each plate, skin-side up. Lay the beetroot slices alongside the mackerel, in a line. Top with red onion rings, then place the grilled mackerel next to the beetroot, skin-side up.Drizzle the beetroot with the herb dressing and place a dollop of horseradish cream alongside.
