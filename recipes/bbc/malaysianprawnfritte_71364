Finely chop half the prawns.Combine the chopped prawns with the bean sprouts, flour, baking powder, chillies, ground coriander, turmeric, spring onions, fresh coriander, salt, pepper and eggs. Mix well.Take a dessertspoonful of the chopped mixture, place one whole prawn on top and press it into the mixture so that the prawn is set in. Continue until you have used up all the mixture and whole prawns.Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or a large wok.Deep-fry the fritters, a few at a time, for 2-3 minutes, until they are golden brown. Drain them on kitchen paper and serve at once.For the seaweed, separate the stalks from the stem of the bok choi and then cut the green leaves from the white stalks.Wash the leaves in several changes of cold water, then drain them thoroughly and dry in a salad spinner.Roll the leaves up tightly, a few at a time, and finely shred them into strips 5mm wide.Spread them out on a baking sheet and put them in an oven preheated to 130C/250F/Gas 1 for 15 minutes to dry slightly.They should not be completely dry or they will burn when fried.  Remove from the oven and leave to cool.  This can be done the day before.Heat a wok over a high heat, then add the oil.  When the oil is hot and slightly smoking deep-fry the greens in three or four batches.  After about 30-40 seconds, when they turn crisp and green, remove them immediately from the wok and drain well on kitchen paper.Leave to cool.Toss the crispy greens with the salt and sugar.Garnish with the pine kernels and serve.
