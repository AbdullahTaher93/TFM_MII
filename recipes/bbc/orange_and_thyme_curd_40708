Combine the orange zest, orange and lemon juices, butter and sugar in a 2 litre/3½ pint heatproof bowl and place over a saucepan of gently simmering water. Make sure the bowl fits snugly without touching the water. Lightly stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has just started to melt – the temperature on a cooking thermometer should be no more than 50C.Meanwhile, place the eggs and egg yolks in a small bowl and beat well. Carefully pour the eggs into the orange mixture and whisk briskly with a balloon whisk for a minute or so until well combined. Cook the mixture for 9–10 minutes, scraping down the sides occasionally with a spatula and giving the mixture a whisk every minute. The curd is cooked when the mixture is thick, the surface is glossy and the temperature reaches 78–80C. Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme.Tip the curd into a wide-necked jug with a good pouring lip, scraping in all of the mixture from the bowl. Fill the three jars and seal at once. Store the jars in a cool place for up to 4 weeks. Once opened, keep in the fridge and eat within 2 weeks.
