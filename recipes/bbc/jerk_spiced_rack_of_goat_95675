Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Rub the goat with salt and the jerk seasoning. Wrap in kitchen foil and put directly on the oven shelf, with a baking tray underneath. Cook for 4½ hours.Blend the corn nuts in a blender to crumbs.Wrap the goat in greased foil, place on a tray and cook in the oven for 4.5 hours.Pour the stout into a pan and simmer until reduced to a sticky sauce.Meanwhile, heat the coconut oil in a saucepan. Pour in the milks and bring to almost boiling point. Pour in the polenta gradually, whisking constantly, until all the polenta is incorporated and there are no lumps. Cook until the polenta is thickened and cooked through – check the instructions on the packet for timings.Transfer the polenta to food processor, blend and add the butter. You can also pass the polenta through a sieve into a clean pan to ensure it is super smooth.Once the goat has been in the oven for 4.5 hours, take out and brush with the reduced stout. Turn the oven up to 240C/220C Fan/Gas 9 and put the goat back in for roughly 10–15 minutes.Place the pineapple on a baking tray and use a blowtorch to blacken all over. Once cool enough to handle, peel and dice the pineapple and place in a bowl. Add the sliced chilli. (Alternatively, peel and core the pineapple, cut  into wedges, and blacken on a preheated griddle pan, then cut into chunks.)Heat 300ml/10fl oz water, the vinegar and sugar in a pan until the sugar has dissolved. Pour over the pineapple.To serve, carve the goat and serve the polenta with the pineapple salsa. Garnish with the coriander cress, crushed corn nuts and chilli jam.
