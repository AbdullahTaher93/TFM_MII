Place the stuffed shallots in a hot, dry pan, cut-side down. Cook and turn until they are gently browned all over. Towards the end of the cooking, add the sugar and vinegar and turn the shallots in the mixture to glaze.Place the shallots and any remaining filling mixture in a serving dish, sprinkle over the cheese and garnish with the mint and coriander leaves.
