For the beetroot salad, bring a large pan of water with a tight fitting lid to the boil, place a steamer insert on top. Add the beetroot, cover the pan and steam for 35-40 minutes, or until tender. (The beetroot is cooked through when a knife inserted into the centre meets no resistance.)Remove the beetroot and set aside to cool slightly before peeling (you may wish to wear gloves when you peel the beetroot to prevent your hands from staining). Slice the beetroot into bite-sized pieces (about 0.5cm/½in thick), then place into a bowl with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and shallot. Mix well, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.For the horseradish crème fraîche, mix all of the horseradish crème fraîche ingredients together, taste, and adjust the seasoning, if required.To serve, divide the beetroot salad among 4 serving plates, scatter the salmon over the top and sprinkle over a little chopped dill. Arrange some fresh beetroot leaves on the side. Spoon the horseradish crème fraîche into small serving bowls and serve alongside.
