Roughly chop one half of the mango and blend to a purée with the lime juice in a food processor.Finely dice the remaining mango half and place into a mixing bowl. Add the chopped mint, lime zest and vanilla seeds and mix well. Pour over the mango purée and mix again.For the poached meringue, in a small pan, dissolve the sugar in the water and liquid glucose, then gradually bring to the boil. As soon as the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low.Pass a clean pastry brush around the insides of the pan to remove any sugar crystals that have formed.Heat the sugar mixture to 115C/239F using a sugar thermometer (this is called the softball stage and should take 10-15 minutes). (Caution: do not overheat the sugar mixture and do not leave it unattended.)Meanwhile, whisk the egg whites in a clean, grease-free bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.Increase the speed of the beaters and, with the motor constantly running, pour a thin stream of the hot sugar mixture into the whisked egg whites, whisking as you pour. Once all of the sugar mixture has been added to the egg whites, continue to whisk the meringue mixture for 10-15 minutes, until it is thick, glossy and cold.Bring the milk and the vanilla pod to the boil in a saucepan, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.Make a quenelle of meringue mixture by creating a ball of meringue using two dessert spoons to smooth it into shape.Lower the quenelle of meringue into the simmering milk and poach gently for 2-3 minutes. Turn over and poach the other side for a further 1-2 minutes, then remove the poached meringue from the milk using a slotted spoon and set aside. Keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining meringue mixture, cooking the quenelles in batches.To serve, divide the mango salsa among four dessert dishes. Float the poached merigues on top. Garnish with a jalebi sweet, if using.
