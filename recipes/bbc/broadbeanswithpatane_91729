When cool enough to handle, peel away the outer membranes.In a bowl, mix together the cooked broad beans, pieces of pata negra ham and chopped garlic until well combined.Drizzle over the olive oil and a splash of sherry vinegar, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well. (NB: Remember that the cured ham will be salty.) Serve immediately.
