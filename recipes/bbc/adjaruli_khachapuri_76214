To make the bread, place the flour, oil, salt, yeast and sugar in a large mixing bowl and mix. Gradually add the water and mix with your hands until a dough is formed. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 5–10 minutes. Leave covered in warm place for at least 1 hour.To make the meat filling, heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the mince and cook for 5–8 minutes, or until browned. Add the onion, garlic, spices, tomato purée and a splash of water and cook for a further 2–3 minutes. Stir in the fresh coriander and mint and set aside to cool.Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and flour a baking tray. On a floured surface, divide the dough in two pieces and knead into balls.To make the meat-filled bread, divide one of the balls in two and roll out both pieces into circle shapes. Top one circle with the meat filling and place the other circle on top. Push down so the meat is sandwiched between the two rounds of dough and the edges are sealed. Brush with the butter.To make the spinach-filled bread, roll out the remaining dough ball to an oval shape. Place the spinach inside the oval, leaving a 2cm/¾in border around the edge. Top with the walnuts and cheeses. Roll the border edge up to form a crust. Place both of the breads on the baking tray and, just before baking, crack the eggs over the top of the spinach filling and brush the crust edge with butter. Bake for 14–18 minutes, or until golden brown.Cut the meat bread into six triangles and cut the spinach bread into six pieces. Scatter with fresh parsley and serve.
