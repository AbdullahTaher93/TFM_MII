Put the garlic and chilli in a medium frying pan with a little coconut oil. Cook until starting to brown, then add the smoked paprika, borlotti beans with their liquid and the juice of one lime and let it blip away for 10 minutes to heat through.Mix the tomatoes with the juice of half a lime and the coriander. Mash the avocados with the juice of the other lime half.Sprinkle the zest of one lime over the feta or tofu and scatter over a couple of large pinches of chilli flakes. Put the remaining coconut oil into a large frying pan and fry the feta or tofu for 3 minutes each side, until just brown, being careful not to move it too much otherwise it will break up.Once the feta or tofu is browned on both sides, remove and keep warm. Add the spring greens and oregano to the same pan, with a little more oil if needed, and add the remaining lime zest, another good pinch of chilli flakes and 2 tablespoons water. Cook until the water has evaporated and the greens are starting to crisp.Serve with tortillas.
