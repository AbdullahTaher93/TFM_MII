Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.Peel the potatoes, cut them into 2.5cm/1in slices, then quarter each slice (halving the smaller end slices) and toss them into a large shallow roasting tin.Tip the jars of peppers – they are normally in quite small strips, snip them with scissors if they’re not – oil and all over the potatoes. Add the coriander seeds and toss to combine before baking in the oven for 1 hour, by which time the potatoes will be soft on the inside and their outside golden, but not crisp, except at the corners.Using a slotted spatula or slotted spoon (let the excess oil drip back into the pan), transfer the potatoes to a large warmed bowl and either serve immediately, or let them stand for 15 minutes, or up to 45 minutes, as they are also excellent warm rather than hot.
