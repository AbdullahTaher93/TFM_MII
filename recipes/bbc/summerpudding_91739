Place the sugar, water and vanilla pod and seeds into a pan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 7-8 minutes, then add the berries and orange liqueur. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool.When cooled, strain the berries through a sieve, reserving both the liquid and the fruit in separate bowls. Discard the vanilla pod.Dip the bread slices in the fruit juice, then use a third of the soaked bread slices to line four small dariole moulds. Spoon some of the berries into the bottoms of each mould, then divide half of the chopped Turkish delight among them. Top with half of the remaining soaked bread, then spoon over the remaining berries and top with the remaining soaked bread. Press down to pack the bread and berries into the moulds.Cover the moulds with cling film and chill in the fridge overnight.To serve, turn the puddings out onto serving plates, dust with icing sugar and top with a dollop of clotted cream. Sprinkle over the chopped Turkish delight and serve.
