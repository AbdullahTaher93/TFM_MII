Start by making the dough. In a large, deep tray, combine the bulgur wheat, fine salt and enough boiling water to just cover the bulgur wheat by about 1cm/½ in. Mix together thoroughly and cover with a clean cloth. Set aside for about an hour, or until all the liquid has been absorbed.Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook until lightly browned. Tip the onions onto a plate, wipe out the pan out and place over a high heat.Add in the remaining olive oil and add the mince, breaking it up with a spoon. Fry the mince for 15 minutes, or until browned all over and any excess moisture has evaporated. Return the onion to the pan and season with salt and pepper.Add the spices and continue to cook for a couple of minutes. Add in the vinegar and sugar and cook for another minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley. Check the seasoning and allow the mince to cool.To finish the dough, add the egg, olive oil and 4 tablespoons of flour. Mix until a rough dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5–10 minutes or until you can form it into a ball without it sticking to your hands. If you feel the mix is too wet just add a little more flour.Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)To shape the koftes, take a piece of dough, a bit bigger than the size of a golf ball. Roll into a ball and then poke your finger in (use slightly wet hands to do this) and whilst turning the ball of dough shape it into a long tunnel. Spoon some of the filling in leaving around 1.5cm/¾ in free at the top.  Seal the ends ensuring there are no gaps or cracks in the dough. Repeat with the remaining mince and dough.Fry the koftes in batches for 5 minutes or until a dark golden brown. Drizzle with yoghurt and pomegranate molasses and serve with lemon wedges.
