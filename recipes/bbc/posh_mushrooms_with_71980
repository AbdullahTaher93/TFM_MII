I like to cook my sourdough on a griddle for that ‘burnt’ bar marked flavour, but you can just grill it if you don’t have a griddle.In a large frying pan, heat the butter and a little rapeseed oil. Add the shallot and grated garlic and gently fry until soft. Add the mushrooms.Fry over a high heat until just cooked. Add the double cream and a splash of truffle oil and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced and the mushrooms are glazed and creamy.Stir in the chives, parsley and wild garlic. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Add lemon juice, to taste.Serve the mushrooms on the toast with the grated Parmesan on top.
