Place the sliced bread in a blender and mix to a crumb then either sauté in a dry frying pan until dry or place on an oven tray and bake for 10 minutes at 200C/400F/Gas 6 until golden brown.Heat up a small pan on the stove then add the blackberries and the sugar.  Sauté for about 1 minute until the berries are warm but not too mashed.  Spoon the berries into the serving bowls, top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Sprinkle the breadcrumbs all over the ice cream and berries.  Serve with a sprig of mint on the ice cream.
