Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.To make the fritters, mix together the okra, red onion, peas, parsley, garlic and cumin. Add the flour and baking powder and mix well. Add the egg, milk and crème fraiche and season.Heat the oil in a large frying pan and fry tablespoons of the batter (you may need to do this in batches). Once golden-brown on both sides, remove from the pan and drain on a kitchen paper. Finish in the oven for 3–4 minutes.To make the red mullet, mix together the two oils, lemon juice, orange juice, sugar, coriander seeds and a little seasoning. Add the carrots and stir well. Place in a small saucepan over a medium heat and warm through to infuse. Set aside to cool.Cut the mullet fillets in half and rub with a little saffron and salt. Heat a little oil in a frying pan and fry the fillets skin-side down for 5 minutes, or until the skin is crisp and golden-brown. Turn over and cook for a few seconds. (The fish should be slightly undercooked.).Drain the fillets on kitchen paper and place flesh-side down into the cooled marinating liquid for 5 minutes.Meanwhile, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in 1 minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended. Deep-fry the plantain for 2 minutes, or until golden-brown on the outside and soft on the inside. Drain on kitchen paper and season with a little salt.To serve, mix with the herbs, flowers, okra and chillies, if using, together. Leave to sit for 1 minute. Place the fritters on a serving plate. Drizzle with the olive oil and all but 1 tablespoon of the yoghurt. Put the marinated fish alongside with the fried plantain, remaining yoghurt and lemon wedges.
