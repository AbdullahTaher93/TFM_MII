Heat the olive oil in a large (preferably cast iron) frying pan over a high heat. When the air above the oil starts to shimmer and the pan is too hot to comfortably hold your hand over, add the padron peppers.Cook on one side for 1 minute, or until the skins to start to blacken and blister, then turn over.Cook for a further minute then continue to cook, shaking the pan regularly, for another 2â€“3 minutes, or until the peppers are blistered all over but have softened to the point that they are just tender.Remove from the pan and drizzle over the extra virgin olive oil. Sprinkle over a generous pinch of flaky sea salt. Serve immediately or at room temperature.
