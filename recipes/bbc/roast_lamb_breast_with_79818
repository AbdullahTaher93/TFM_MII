Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Score the skin side of the lamb breast using a sharp knife. Season with salt and rub the garlic, rosemary and thyme all over the meat. Press the herbs and garlic into the scores.Place the breast on a roasting rack and then on a baking tray. Roast for 1–1½ hours.Meanwhile, season the onions with salt and rub the harissa into them. Place on a separate baking tray and put into the oven halfway through the lamb cooking time.When the lamb is cooked, the skin should be crispy and the breast should be cooked through, so you can put the back of a spoon easily through the meat. About 5 minutes before the end of the cooking time, add half the kale to the tray with the onions and cook for the remaining minutes.Leave the lamb to rest for 15 minutes and place the onions and cooked kale in a large bowl. Put the raw kale in a separate bowl. Heat the vinegar in a saucepan and, when hot, pour over the raw kale. Leave to sit for a few minutes, then drain.Add the tomatoes, mint and parsley to the harissa onions. Add black pepper and lemon juice to taste and mix in the rice wine kale and stir.Place the lamb on a chopping board, carve and serve with the harissa onion and tomato salad.
