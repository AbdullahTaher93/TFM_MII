Heat the oil in a wok if yours has a lid, otherwise use a large casserole. Add half of the pork belly and fry for several minutes until well browned. Remove from the wok and add the rest of the pork belly and repeat. Remove the pork and set aside.If necessary, add a little more oil and then add the shallots. Fry on a medium heat for a few minutes until lightly golden, then add the garlic and lemongrass. Stir fry for another minute or two, then add the palm sugar (or brown sugar), star anise and Chinese five-spice powder along with 200ml/7fl oz water and the fish sauce. Return the pork to the wok.Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer and cover. Cook for around 1.5 hours, or until the pork is tender. Uncover, turn up the heat slightly and cook for a further 10-15 minutes to reduce the sauce.Serve with steamed jasmine rice, garnished with spring onions and coriander.
