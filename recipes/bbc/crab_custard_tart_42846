Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Line a 24cm/9½in round fluted loose-bottomed tart tin with the puff pastry and trim the edges with a sharp knife. Cover and chill for 15 minutes in the fridge or 5 minutes in the freezer. Prick the base of the pastry all over with a fork, line with baking parchment, fill with baking beans and blind bake for 20 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and bake for a further 5 minutes or until the pastry is golden-brown. The centre of the pastry may rise: if this happens, gently press it back down when you take it out of the oven.Meanwhile, squeeze any excess liquid out of the crab meat. Add the crab to a bowl, together with the lemon zest and juice and most of the spring onions, dill and coriander. Season to taste with salt and pepper.In another bowl, beat together the eggs and cream with the remaining chopped herbs and spring onions. Season with a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and some pepper. Pour this into the baked pastry case, then add the crab mixture, so it is still visible in places above the egg and cream mixture. Bake for 20–25 minutes until golden-brown and set.Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 10 minutes, then serve with a few dill fronds and coriander leaves scattered over.
