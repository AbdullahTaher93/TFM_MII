For the brioche, place the eggs, butter, salt, flours, sugar and yeast into the bowl of a mixer. Combine using the whisk attachment of a mixer and then gradually add the milk to form a very sticky dough. The process should take around 15 minutes. Cover the bowl and leave to rise in the fridge overnight.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Lightly grease 8 brioche moulds.Divide the dough into 8 portions. Remove a small piece from each portion and roll all pieces into balls. Place the smaller balls in indentations at the top of the larger balls, like a cherry on the top.Place each portion in the moulds, brush with the beaten egg glaze and sprinkle with the granulated sugar. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until golden.For the granita, bring 350ml/12fl oz of water to the boil in a large saucepan. Remove from the heat, leave to cool slightly and then stir in the almond paste and sugar until dissolved. Pour into a freezerproof tray then place in the freezer. After 1 hour, use a fork to break apart any ice crystals. Place back in the freezer but repeat the breaking of the ice crystals every 30 minutes. The entire process will take 3–5 hours, or until you achieve the consistency you desire.Layer the granita with double cream into dessert glasses and scatter with the toasted almonds. Serve with the brioche alongside.
