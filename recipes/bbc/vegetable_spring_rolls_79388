Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.Mix the carrot, beans, beansprouts, spring onion, red pepper and sweet chilli sauce together in a bowl.Lay a piece of filo pastry on the work surface in a diamond shape. Brush with a little oil, then cover with another piece of pastry. Brush with more oil.Spoon one-quarter of the filling onto the corner nearest you. Fold this corner towards the centre and tuck it under the filling. Fold the two outside corners in towards the middle so it looks like an envelope. Brush with oil, then roll up the pastry to look like a sausage. Repeat with the remaining mixture and pastry.Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.
