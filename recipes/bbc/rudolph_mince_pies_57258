For the pastry, put the flour, butter and salt into a food processor and pulse until you have a breadcrumb consistency. Add the egg yolks, pulse briefly, then add the milk a tablespoon at a time and pulse until the dough comes together. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead very quickly with your hands until the dough is smooth. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.For the filling, melt the butter, sugar and honey together in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to the boil and remove from the heat. Stir in the cream and almonds and leave to cool completely.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Grease 2 x 12-hole muffin trays with butter.Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll out between two sheets of baking paper. Using a cutter, cut out 20 circles of pastry slightly larger than the top of the muffin tray holes. Line the muffin tray with the circles of pastry. Fill with a heaped teaspoon of mincemeat and top with the almond filling.Bake for 18-22 minutes, covering with foil when the filling turns golden-brown. Remove from the oven and immediately pop half a glac√© cherry on each pie, cut-side down. Transfer to a wire rack and serve warm.
