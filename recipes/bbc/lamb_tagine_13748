For the lamb tagine, in a large ovenproof, lidded pan or casserole heat the olive oil. Season the lamb with salt and pepper. Once the oil is hot, brown the lamb on all sides for about 10 minutes. Add the onions and garlic. Cook for a few minutes to soften, then stir in the aubergines and spices and cook for a further 2 minutes.Pour in the white wine and simmer until the volume of liquid is reduced in volume by half. Stir in the tomato purée, tinned tomatoes and chickpeas and cook for a few minutes to reduce further.Add the apricots and stock. Cover the pan with a lid and cook gently for 1½–2 hours, or until the meat is very tender.Just before serving, remove the lid off and reduce the sauce a little until thickened, if necessary.Meanwhile, put the couscous in a large heatproof bowl. Mix the saffron into the hot stock then pour it over the couscous. Cover with cling film and leave for 5 minutes.Once the stock has been soaked up, mix in the flaked almonds, raisins, olive oil and chopped herbs.Serve the lamb tagine in bowls with the couscous alongside. Garnish with the chopped mint and coriander.
