Put the eggs into a shallow bowl, wide enough to take a slice of bread, and add the milk, salt, sugar, turmeric, garlic granules and onion granules. Mix well and leave to sit for 5 minutes, allowing the granules to rehydrate in the egg mix.Sandwich the slices of bread together with the ham and cheese. Dip them into the egg mixture and pop them on a plate.Put a non-stick frying pan on the hob with a thin layer of oil on the base.Take one of the sandwiches and dip it back into the egg mixture to get another soaking, then fry on a medium heat for 3 minutes, until it has a golden-brown colour and the cheese begins to melt. Turnover and cook for another 3 minutes, pressing lightly with a spatula to help seal the bread, then pop the sandwich onto a plate lined with some kitchen paper. When theyâ€™re all done, cut them in half.Add some more oil to the base of the pan and repeat with the other sandwiches, dipping and frying in the same way. Depending how absorbent the bread is, you may find you have enough eggy mixture left to make another sandwich.Serve hot, with a dollop of ketchup if you like.These are best eaten fresh, but if there are any leftovers you can wrap them in foil and freeze them.
