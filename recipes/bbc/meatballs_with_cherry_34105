For the meatballs, put all of the meatball ingredients, apart from the oil, in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then use your hands to thoroughly mix everything together. Divide the mixture into 10 evenly sized pieces and roll each piece into a ball, then flatten slightly so they will cook more quickly.Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat then add the meatballs and fry for 5-6 minutes, turning once or twice, or until golden-brown on both sides and cooked through.For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat, add the garlic and chilli and fry for 1 minute. Tip in the tomatoes, increase the heat to high, and simmer for 5 minutes to reduce slightly then season with salt and pepper. Stir in the basil leaves, reserving a little for garnish.To serve, spoon the hot tagliatelle into a wide bowl, put the meatballs on top, pour over the tomato sauce, scatter with Parmesan and garnish with a little basil.
