Drain and set aside.Place the same pan over a medium heat and toast the bread, 1 teaspoon of the reserved chilli seeds, sesame seeds, almonds, coriander seeds, peppercorns and cinnamon until fragrant but not burnt. Set them aside and blend to a powder when cool.Heat 2 tablespoons of the corn oil in a separate pan and fry the plantain (or banana).

Blend into a smooth sauce.Pour the sauce into a clean saucepan with the remaining stock and the chocolate.

Taste for seasoning and add a little salt if needed.Coat the chicken breasts with the remaining 2 tablespoons corn oil and season with salt.
