Put the onion, chillies, ginger, garlic, turmeric, ground coriander, cinnamon and salt into a food processor and blend to a paste, or use a stick blender and a bowl.Heat the coconut or vegetable oil in a wide lidded heavy-based casserole, then fry the paste for about 1 minute, stirring well. Don’t use a wooden spoon unless you don’t mind it being stained by the turmeric.Open the tin of coconut milk carefully and then scrape off the creamy top into the paste, stirring everything together over the heat for another minute or so before adding the rest of the tin of coconut milk, followed by the stock, tinned tomatoes, then the sweet potato and squash. Stir well, bring to the boil and, once bubbling, turn down the heat, put the lid on and simmer for 40–50 minutes (though start checking at 30) until the sweet potatoes are soft and the squash cooked through. Check for seasoning, then leave to stand off the heat for 10 minutes or so before serving.Meanwhile, cook the rice according to packet instructions.Serve with the rice and put chopped coriander and lime wedges on the table alongside, for sprinkling and spritzing.
