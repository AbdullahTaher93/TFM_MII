For the koftas, mix the mince with all the other ingredients, except the oil, in a large bowl and use your hands to make golf-ball sized rounds, which you can then mould into long cylinder-like kofta shapes. Place the koftas on a baking tray and transfer to the fridge to chill for a couple of hours.Heat the vegetable oil in a deep frying pan until hot. Shallow fry the koftas (alternatively cook on a hot barbecue or in an oven preheated to 200C/400F/Gas 6 for 20-25 minutes). When the koftas are cooked through, set them aside to rest until ready to serve.Meanwhile, make the baba ganoush. Roast the aubergines directly over a gas flame on the hob until the skins are blackened (or use a chef's blowtorch if you have one) taking care not to burn yourself. Leave to cool for a bit, then peel away the charred skin.Put the aubergine flesh into a food processor or blender with the garlic, tahini, lemon juice, cumin and some salt and pepper and blend to a rough paste. Transfer to a serving dish, drizzle with the olive oil and scatter with the parsley.Serve the cooked koftas with the baba ganoush and flatbreads.
