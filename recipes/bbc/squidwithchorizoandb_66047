Fry the chorizo slices in olive oil in a frying pan until they crisp a little on the edges.  Add the beans, chicken stock and paprika and simmer gently for 5 minutes.Mix the flour, salt, pepper and paprika together. Put a colander  over a basin. Cut the squid bodies into 1cm/Â½in  rings and the tentacles into small sections.Toss the squid pieces in the flour, then tip them into the colander and vigorously shake off the excess flour into the bowl below.Heat 3 tbsp light olive oil in a frying pan until hot and fry the squid very quickly, turning once, then drain on a paper towel. Do this in batches rather than crowding the pan.Divide the beans and sausage between four warmed dinner plates, scatter with rocket leaves (if using) and arrange the fried squid on top. Serve with lemon wedges.
