Set aside.Season the mackerel fillets on their skin side with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat the butter in a frying pan until it is foaming, then add the fillets skin-side down. Place a heat-proof plate onto the cooking fillets, as this will make sure they stay flat and cook evenly. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until nearly cooked through, then turn the fillets and cook for 30 seconds, or until just cooked through.To serve, place a small handful of the cucumber onto the toast.
