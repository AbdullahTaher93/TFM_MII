Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.Meanwhile, sift the flour, baking powder and cocoa together in a bowl and set aside.Separate the eggs. Whisk the yolks in a bowl until frothy.  Stir the eggs into the chocolate and butter mixture, then fold in the beetroot.Whisk the egg whites until still peaks form when the whisk is removed. Fold in the sugar.Fold the sugar and egg whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the flour and cocoa mixture.Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean.Allow to cool in the tin, then serve with crème fraîche or double cream.
