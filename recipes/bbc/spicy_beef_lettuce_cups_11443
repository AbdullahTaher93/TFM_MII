Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line a large baking tray with baking paper.Spread the beef mince out on the lined baking tray and cook in the oven for 40 minutes, breaking it up well with a wooden spoon every 10 minutes. It should have a dark, even colour and resemble large coffee granules. Remove from the oven and set aside.Place a wok over a high heat and add the oil. When it begins to smoke, add the onion, garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 1 minute.Add the chilli, carrot, kohlrabi and green beans and stir-fry for another 3–4 minutes.Add the water chestnuts, beansprouts, vermicelli, cooked beef mince, rice wine and all the sauces. Stir fry for another two minutes, adding 1–2 tablespoons of water if it gets a little dry.Divide the stir-fry between warmed bowls and place on large plates, with the lettuce leaves alongside. Scatter with spring onions and chopped cashews and serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.
