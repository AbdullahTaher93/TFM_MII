For the chicken escalopes, place a chicken breast onto a cling film-lined board and cover with cling film. Using a meat hammer or rolling pin, bash the chicken until it is just 5mm thick.Remove from the cling film and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Repeat with the remaining chicken.Scatter the flour over a plate along with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Place the eggs in a bowl and lightly beat, and tip the breadcrumbs onto another plate. Dust each chicken breast in the flour, then dip in the egg and finally coat each side with the breadcrumbs.For the caper sauce, heat the olive oil and butter in a large frying pan, then add the chicken breasts, one at a time, and fry until golden-brown and completely cooked through (about 2 minutes on each side). Remove with a fish slice and drain on several layers of kitchen paper.Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and fry for one minute. Add the gherkins and capers and cook for a further minute. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste, and add the parsley.For the courgettes, heat the olive oil and butter in a pan and add the courgettes and rosemary. Saut√© for 3-4 minutes until just turning golden-brown and starting to soften. Add the tomatoes and cook for a further two minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black black pepper, to taste.Serve the chicken with the caper sauce spooned over and a pile of courgettes and tomatoes on the side.
