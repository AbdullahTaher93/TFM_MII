To make the tomato sauce, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and celery and fry for 3–4 minutes until just softening.Add the garlic, carrot and courgette to the pan and sweat for a further 2–3 minutes.Add the oregano and tomato purée, mix well then tip in the chopped tomatoes. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 10–12 minutes, or until all the vegetables are tender. Season with the salt and pepper.Use a stick blender to blitz the tomato sauce until smooth. Set aside to cool.Meanwhile, to make the pizzas, tip the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the centre. Pour in the oil with 350ml/12fl oz water. Gradually mix together using a wooden spoon, until you have a sticky dough.Line two large baking trays with baking paper. Divide the dough between the two trays and press out, with wet hands, until it covers the tray evenly. Cover with cling film and set aside to rise for 30 minutes at room temperature, or in the fridge for a couple of hours.Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.When the dough has risen, put both trays in the oven and bake for 20 minutes until golden brown. Remove and spread the tomato sauce over the top, leaving just 1cm around the edge free. Scatter over the mozzarella, ham and vegetables.Bake for a further 12 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.Serve straight away.
