Lay 4 large square sheets of greaseproof paper onto a work surface. Divide the sweet potato between the 4 sheets, piling them into the centre of the paper. Divide the leeks, beans and frozen peas between the sheets then top each with a piece of frozen pollock. Season the fish well with salt and pepper. Scatter the chives over the top and drizzle with the rapeseed oil.Seal the fish into a parcel by folding the paper in half into a triangle, then crimp the edges together, folding the edge over itself so that it seals all the way along, so it looks a little like a Cornish pasty!Place 2 parcels onto a microwave-safe plate. Cook in the microwave on a high setting for 10 minutes until the fish is cooked through and the parcels have expanded. Leave them to rest for 2 minutes before opening.To check that the fish is cooked through, open one of the parcels and see if the fish is white and hot to the touch. If not, reseal and return to the microwave for another 5 minutes and check again.Put each parcel onto a plate and open at the table, adding a squeeze of lemon juice over the fish just before serving.
