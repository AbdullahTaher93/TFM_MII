To make the base, melt the chocolate and butter in a wide-based pan over a medium heat. Remove the pan from the heat, add the crushed biscuits and stir to combine. Press into the base of a 23cm/9in loose-bottomed, fluted tart tin with deep sides and chill in the fridge while you make the filling.To make the filling, put the chocolate, butter, coffee and double cream in a large heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over a pan of just simmering water and stir gently until the mixture is smooth and runny. Remove from the heat and allow to cool a little, then mix in the crème fraîche by hand. Carefully pour the mixture on top of the biscuit base and chill for a minimum of 2 hours, or ideally overnight, until set.Remove the tart from the tin and place it on a cake stand or serving plate.To decorate, spoon the whipped cream into a piping bag (if using) and pipe or dollop five large blobs of the cream into the middle of the tart. Sprinkle over the chocolate shavings or grated chocolate and serve immediately in thin slices (alternatively return the tart to the fridge until ready to serve).
