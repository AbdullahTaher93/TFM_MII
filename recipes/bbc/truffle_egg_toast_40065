Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Lightly toast the bread on both sides.Put the bread on a tray. Use a very sharp knife to carefully cut a shallow well into the centre of the bread, about a 5cm/2in square. To do this cut the edges and push down the centre. Remember this is a well not a hole. It is important that you donâ€™t cut all the way through!Distribute the fontina evenly around the rim of the well.Mix the yolks together with the truffle oil and pour them into the well then bake for 3-5 minutes until the cheese melts.Take the toast out and give the yolk a little stir then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Eat immediately.
