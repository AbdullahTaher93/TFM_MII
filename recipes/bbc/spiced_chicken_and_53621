In a pestle and mortar (or a small blender), pound together the garlic, coriander root and the galangal. Add the palm sugar and make a smooth paste.Put the mixture into a large bowl. Add the lime juice and a good pinch of white pepper.  Add the sesame oil, Thai fish sauce and soy sauce.  Mix thoroughly with the chicken in a shallow dish, cover with cling film and marinade in the fridge for half an hour.For the sauce, mix all the sauce ingredients together in a bowl. Pour into a suitable serving bowl and leave to one side.Take a large pan of boiling water and gently ease in the pandan leaves, blanching for 30 seconds and then remove and dry with some kitchen paper.Take a pandan leaf and wrap it around a piece of the chicken, trim the thick stalk off and secure with a cocktail stick. Repeat to use up all the chicken and leaves.Heat the oil in a pan, wok or a deep-fat fryer to 180C/350F (CAUTION: hot oil is dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Fry for eight minutes, or until the pandan is golden-brown and the chicken cooked through.  You will need to cook the parcels in batches. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.Serve with the sauce and wedges of lime.
