Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Put an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. When it is hot, lay the duck breasts in it skin-side down. Once the fat starts to caramelise, transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 6-8 minutes, until done to your liking. Transfer the duck to a plate and leave to rest.Turn the heat up to high and pour the fat out of the pan then add the wine. Using a spoon, scrape up the sticky bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the thyme and bay leaf. When the wine has reduced down, whisk in the butter and duck sauce. Remove from the heat and pour the sauce through a fine sieve into a saucepan and set aside.Put the goat’s curd and cordial in a medium bowl, season with salt and beat using a spoon. In a separate bowl, mix the raw peas, mint and half the vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper. In a third bowl, mix the radishes with the remaining vinaigrette and season with salt.Spoon the goat’s curd on to two plates, spoon around the peas, lay over the radishes and finish with the pea shoots and a twist of black pepper over the goat’s curd. Heat the sauce through. Season and carve the duck and serve on the plate with the sauce on the side.
