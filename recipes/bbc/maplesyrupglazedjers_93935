Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.Lay the pancetta slices onto a baking tray and place another baking tray on top. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the pancetta is crisp and golden-brown. Set the pancetta aside until completely cool, still sandwiched between the trays (this will keep the pancetta flat as it cools).Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium frying pan and fry the onions over a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until browned on all sides.Place a piece of aluminium foil on a baking tray and place the onion wedges and garlic in the centre of the foil. Drizzle over 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, sprinkle over the thyme leaves and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fold the tin foil over to make a parcel and seal all around the edges.Bake the parcel for 15 minutes, or until the onions have softened. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile for the potatoes, cook the potatoes in a saucepan of boiling water for 15-20 minutes, or until tender. Drain the potatoes, place them into cold water to stop the cooking process and set aside.Heat the butter in a medium frying pan, and fry the potatoes for 5 minutes, or until golden-brown all over.For the calamari, cut the squid in half lengthways. Lay the sheets of squid flat, then score a criss-cross pattern onto it using a sharp knife. Cut the sheets into strips and discard the tentacles.Heat the remaining oil in a medium frying pan over a high heat and quickly fry the squid until opaque, this will take around 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and stir in the rest of the butter and lemon juice.Place the potatoes in the centre of a large serving plate. Take each onion wedge and separate each layer to make petals of onion and scatter these around the potatoes. Squeeze the garlic out of the skins and dot the puree over the salad. Scatter over the crisp pancetta, squid and thyme leaves over the top of the potatoes and drizzle over the maple syrup.
