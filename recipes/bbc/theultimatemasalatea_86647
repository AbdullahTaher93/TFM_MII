Heat the water and milk in a pan with the spices and ginger until it comes to the boil. Turn the heat down and cook over a low to medium heat for 15 minutes. Be careful as the milk can easily rise and boil over.Once the volume is reduced to a large cupful, add the teabag and let it brew for one minute, or longer if you like strong tea.To serve, strain into a cup and add sugar or salt if using, to taste.
