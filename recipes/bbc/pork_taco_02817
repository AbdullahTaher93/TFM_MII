Heat a large frying pan until medium hot, add the oil, red onion and pepper and stir well. Fry for 2â€“3 minutes, until just softened.Turn up the heat and add the garlic, cooked pork, cumin, coriander and chilli powder, stirring well. Fry over a high heat until the pork is crisp around the edges and the vegetables are just tender. Add the tomatoes and cook for another couple of minutes, until they have just broken down. Season well with salt and pepper.Heat the wraps according to packet instructions, then divide between the serving plates. Spoon the pork mixture into the centre of the wraps, then dollop a little sour cream along the top. Finish with a handful of lettuce and cucumber, then roll up and serve straightaway.
