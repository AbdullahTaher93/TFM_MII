Sit the lamb on a board and spread it out in a butterfly shape. Lay cling film on the top and bash the thickest parts of the meat with a mallet, so that the meat is fairly equal in thickness throughout.To marinate the lamb, put it in a large dish or freezer bag. In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice and the zest. Add the honey, coriander, cumin, oil and a generous amount of salt and pepper.Mix together until combined and pour over the lamb. Rub the marinade into the meat, cover and put in the fridge for at least two hours.To make the raita, mix together the yoghurt, cucumber, mint, dill, ground cumin, lemon zest and pickled cucumbers and a good pinch of salt.Put a large griddle pan over a high heat, add the oil and then add the lamb â€“ it will fit snugly. Fry for 10 minutes on each side, or until cooked through but still pink. Transfer to a board, cover in foil and rest for 15 minutes before carving.Slice the lamb and serve in warmed flatbreads with a dollop of herby raita.
