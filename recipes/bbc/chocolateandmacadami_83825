Mix in the chocolate chunks and nuts.Shape the dough into a long sausage on a board, and cut into rounds about 1cm/Â½in wide. It may be quite crumbly.Grease and flour a non-stick baking tray. Place each round on the tray and gently press down with the back of a fork.Bake at the top of the oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
