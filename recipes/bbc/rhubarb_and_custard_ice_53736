For the rhubarb compôte, place the rhubarb, sugar, lime juice and glucose in a small non-stick saucepan. Cook gently for 10–12 minutes, or until the rhubarb has softened and broken down. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl. Stir in the essence, if using, and leave to cool completely.Meanwhile, to make the ice cream, whisk the condensed milk, cream, vanilla and glucose together in a bowl until it forms soft peaks. Fold in the cooled rhubarb mixture to create a ripple effect. Transfer to a plastic container with a lid and freeze for 4 hours, or until firm.Meanwhile, to make the biscuits, place the butter and sugar in a bowl. Cream together until pale and fluffy, then add the egg and almond extract. Add the flour and custard powder and mix to form a ball of dough. Flatten the ball slightly and wrap in cling film, then chill in the fridge for 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5 and line a baking tray with baking paper.Dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the dough to the thickness of 7.5mm/⅓in. Use a 6.5cm/2½in round cutter to cut out biscuits. Collect the off-cuts, roll again and cut out more biscuits until you have used up all the dough. You should have eight biscuits, to make four sandwiches.Place the biscuits on the baking tray and prick with a fork to stop them from rising too much. Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until light golden-brown but visibly yellow from the custard powder.Leave to cool on the tray. Once cooled, sandwich a large scoop of ice cream between two biscuits. Repeat with the remaining biscuits. Eat before they melt!
