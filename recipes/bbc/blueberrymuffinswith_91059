For the muffins, preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper muffin cases.In a mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, sugar, milk, melted butter and vanilla extract until pale and fluffy and well combined.Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl, then carefully fold it into the mixture until well combined.Carefully fold in the blueberries.Divide the batter mixture equally among the 12 prepared muffin cases. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the muffins have risen and are pale golden-brown.For the Bourbon berries, heat the blueberries and sugar in a pan over a low heat for 1-2 minutes, or until the sugar has melted and the blueberries have softened.Add the Bourbon and set alight. Allow the flames to flare up then die down. (CAUTION: Keep the pan away from your eyes, face and surroundings.)To serve, place one of the warm muffins into the centre of each serving plate. Spoon over the Bourbon berries. Place a scoop of ice cream alongside each. Dust with icing sugar.
