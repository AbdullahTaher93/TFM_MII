Dry fry the flaked almonds in a small frying pan over a medium–high heat. Toss them around until golden brown, then set aside in a bowl and leave to cool.Put the mango pulp, mint, lime juice and zest into a large bowl that fits in the fridge. Pour in the almond milk, add half of the toasted almonds and stir well.Add the oats and mix well again, making sure the oats are covered. Cover and pop into the fridge overnight, ready for breakfast in the morning.Next morning, take the bowl out of the fridge – the oats will have doubled in volume, as they will have soaked up all the excess moisture of the mango.Make the topping by mixing the chopped mango and mint together. Serve in small bowls or jam jars, top with the mango, and sprinkle with the remaining toasted flaked almonds.
