Grease the holes in a six-hole mini-muffin tray with butter.In a bowl, mix together the flour, sugar and mixed spice. Add the dried fruit and chopped fudge and mix again until well combined. Stir in the yeast.Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients. Gradually pour in the milk, bringing the dry ingredients into the pool of milk using a fork, until the mixture comes together as a dough. You may not need all of the milk - try to avoid the dough becoming too sticky.Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead well for about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.Divide the dough into six equally sized pieces. Push one into each of the holes in the muffin tray. Cover the tray with a clean, damp tea towel and set aside in a warm room for 45-60 minutes, or until the buns have almost doubled in size.Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Bake the buns in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until risen, golden-brown and cooked through (a skewer inserted into the centre of each should come out clean). Remove the buns from the muffin tray whilst they are still warm (be careful as the fudge will be very hot).Serve with seedless grapes, if desired.
