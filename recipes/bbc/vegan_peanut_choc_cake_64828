Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line the base of each cake tin with a circle of baking paper.Sift the flour, caster sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and a pinch of salt into a mixing bowl.Measure the almond milk into a jug, add the cider vinegar and mix to combine – the milk will thicken. Add the oil and vanilla extract.Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients, pour in the oil and milk mixture, add the peanut butter and whisk to combine. Continue mixing until smooth.Divide the cake mixture evenly between the prepared tins and level with the back of a spoon.Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the cakes have risen and a wooden skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean.Leave the cakes to cool in the tins for 3–4 minutes and then carefully turn out onto a wire rack and leave until cold.Meanwhile prepare the frosting. Tip all of the ingredients into a mixing bowl and beat until smooth.Place one cake on a serving plate and spread the top with half the frosting. Top with the second cake layer and spread the remaining frosting over the top, spreading it smoothly with a palette knife.Scatter with roughly chopped peanuts and dark chocolate shavings to serve.
