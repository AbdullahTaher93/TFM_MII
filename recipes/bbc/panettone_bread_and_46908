Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.Liberally spread the sliced pannetone with the butter and then the blackberry compôte.Lay the pannetone in a 20x30cm/8x12in baking tin or ovenproof dish in any order that makes you happy – in a symmetrical pattern or higgledy-piggledy, it’s entirely up to you!Whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, milk, cream and caster sugar in a large mixing bowl.Pour some of the egg mixture over the slices of pannetone and allow to rest for five minutes. Repeat the process a couple more times, until all the mixture is used up.Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until brown on top, but still a little wobbly.Serve the pudding in serving bowls, dusted with icing sugar and with a little pouring cream, if liked.
