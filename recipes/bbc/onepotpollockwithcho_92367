Dredge the fish fillets in the flour, shaking off any excess.Heat a non-stick frying pan until hot, add the vegetable oil and fry the fish fillets for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown. Carefully flip the fish over and fry for a further 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown all over and just cooked through (the fish should be opaque all the way through).Add the butterbeans and chorizo to the pan, add the stock and cook for 1-2 minutes to heat through.Add the spinach, goats' cheese and butter to the pan and cook until the cheese is melted.To serve, place a fish fillet each into four shallow serving bowls and spoon the butterbeans, chorizo, spinach and goats' cheese mixture around. Serve with some crusty bread.
