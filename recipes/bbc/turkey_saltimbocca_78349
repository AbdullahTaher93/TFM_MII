First prepare the turkey. Put each steak between two large pieces of cling film. Lay it on a work surface, then beat it with a meat mallet or a rolling pin until it is as thin as you can get it without it breaking up. Repeat with the remaining turkey. Cut each escalope in half.Season the flour with salt and pepper then use to dust the flattened turkey. Pat off any excess. Place a sage leaf in the centre of each piece of turkey, then wrap a slice of Parma ham round it.Heat the olive oil and butter in a large frying pan. Fry 2-3 of the escalopes (depending on the size of your pan) on each side for 3-4 minutes, or until the meat is completely cooked through and the ham has crisped up. Remove from the pan and keep warm. Add more oil and butter and continue as before.When you have cooked all the escalopes, turn up the heat. Add the lemon zest, dried sage and Marsala to the pan. Leave to simmer for a couple of minutes until the Marsala looks syrupy, then add the chicken stock. Continue to cook until the sauce again looks syrupy.For the game chips, cut the potato into very thin rounds, preferably with a mandoline. Cover with cold water in a bowl for 10-15 minutes to help remove some of the starch. Drain and pat dry as thoroughly as possible with a tea towel or kitchen towel.Half fill a saucepan or deep fat fryer with vegetable oil. Heat to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) If you don’t have a thermometer gauge, test the heat of the oil by dropping in a cube of bread – it should crisp up and brown in 30 seconds.Fry the chips a few at a time in the oil – they are done when they have floated to the surface and have turned a light golden-brown. Remove from the oil and continue with the remaining potato slices. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately.Serve the turkey saltimbocca with the sauce poured over and the game chips on the side.
