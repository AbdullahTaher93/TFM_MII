For the basil oil, put the oil, basil and salt in a blender and blitz until smooth. Set aside.For the gnocchi, put the potatoes in a large saucepan of cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, or until soft when pierced with a fork. Drain thoroughly.Put the potatoes through a potato ricer and place in a large bowl. Add the flour, egg and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Mix to a dough then turn out onto a floured work surface and knead gently for 2–3 minutes.Divide the dough into four and roll each piece into a sausage that is about 50cm/20in long. Cut each sausage into 15 pieces and, using the tines of a fork, press each piece gently to shape the gnocchi, leaving a dent from your thumb or finger on one side and fork marks on top. Put on a floured plate and continue to shape the rest.Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the gnocchi on each side until golden brown.Heat a large saucepan of boiling water and blanch the broccoli and asparagus. Drain.Heat the butter in a frying pan and cook the broccoli, asparagus and peas for 5–8 minutes, or until the vegetables are just cooked through. Stir in the lemon zest and juice.Divide the gnocchi between four warmed plates and top with the spring vegetables. Garnish with the basil oil and pea shoots and serve immediately.
