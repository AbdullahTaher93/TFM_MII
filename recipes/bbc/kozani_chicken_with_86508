Add the chicken thighs, about 700ml/1¼ pint of the cooking liquid and the prunes. Season with the salt and pepper and simmer for about 20 minutes, until heated through.If the sauce is very watery, remove the chicken, prunes and onions with a slotted spoon and keep warm while you reduce down the sauce, so that you have a small amount to spoon over each portion.Serve with pilaf rice.
