For the steamed ginger fish, pat the fish dry with kitchen paper and rub all over with the salt.  Place the fish on a heatproof plate and scatter evenly with the ginger, orange zest and lemon zest.Set up a steamer or put a rack into a wok or deep pan that has a tight fitting lid. Fill with 5cm (2in) of water, place over a high heat and bring to the boil.Reduce the heat slightly and place the fish, still on the plate, onto the steamer or rack. Cover the pan tightly and gently steam for about five minutes, or until just cooked.  The fish will turn opaque and flake slightly but remain moist.Take the plate off the heat and drain off any liquid that may have accumulated around the fish. Scatter the spring onions over the fish then drizzle with the soy sauce and sprinkle over the basil.Heat the peanut or groundnut oil with the olive oil until just smoking then pour over the fish (pour carefully, as the oil may splatter) and serve at once.While the fish is steaming make the egg-fried rice. Put the eggs, sesame oil and half the salt in a small jug or bowl, mix with a fork and set aside.Heat a wok over a high heat. Add the groundnut oil and when it is very hot and slightly smoking add the cold cooked rice.Stir-fry for three minutes, or until it is thoroughly heated through.Slowly pour in the egg and oil mixture and continue to stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the eggs have set and the mixture is dry.Add the remaining salt and the freshly ground black pepper and stir-fry for two more minutes, then add the spring onions.Stir several times, turn on to a plate and serve at once.
