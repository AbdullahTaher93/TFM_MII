Put the flour, yeast, salt and sugar (or honey) in a bowl and drizzle in the olive oil, then the water, mixing together until it comes together as a dough. Add the chorizo, 50g/1¾oz of the cheese and the chives (or other herbs).Knead in the bowl for a minute until the additions have worked in a little, then knead on a floured surface until the dough is smooth. Return to the bowl, cover with a damp cloth or cling film and leave to rest somewhere warm for 1½ –2 hours, until doubled in size.Preheat your oven to its highest setting. Knock back the risen dough and divide into 8–10 even pieces. Knead and shape into balls, then place in a 28cm/11in diameter cake tin or a small roasting tin, which has been lined with greaseproof paper. Cover with a damp towel again and leave to rise for another 20–30 minutes, or until risen and squashing together.Brush lightly with the egg glaze (you need a very light touch if the bread dough is at all puffy and springy), then sprinkle over the remaining 50g/1¾oz cheese. Bake in the oven for 20–25 minutes, or until cooked through and a golden-brown colour. They should feel slightly hollow. Serve warm from the oven or cold.
