For the deep-fried eggs, preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Lay two sheets of cling film on top of each other on a work surface. Spread half of the chorizo paste evenly over the cling film and place a hard-boiled egg in the middle. Carefully gather up the cling film and enclose the egg in the chorizo spread, pressing to fully encase the egg. Repeat with the other half of the spread and egg.Place the beaten egg, flour and breadcrumbs in separate, shallow bowls and season the flour with salt and pepper. Dip the eggs into the flour, egg and crumbs. Carefully lower the eggs into the deep-fat fryer and cook until crisp. Set aside on kitchen paper to drain.For the smoked haddock broth, bring the milk and saffron to a low simmer in a saucepan and add the fish. Turn the heat down and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Remove the fish from the milk and set aside. Reserve the milk.Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan. Add the onion, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, celery, potato, leek and star anise and cook for 10 minutes, or until soft. Add the reserved milk and stir. Remove the bay leaf, thyme and star anise from the saucepan and then blend the mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth. Pass the broth through a sieve.For the chorizo oil, heat the oil in a small frying pan and add the chorizo and paprika. Cook for a few minutes until the chorizo just flavours the oil. Pour off the oil and reserve. The chorizo can be used for another recipe.Spoon the broth into serving bowls and top with flakes of the haddock and the deep-fried eggs. Drizzle over the chorizo oil and serve immediately.
