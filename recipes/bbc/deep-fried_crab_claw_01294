Put the crab shells, prawn heads and shells, star anise, chicken stock and brandy in a large saucepan and cook for 40–50 minutes. Strain, reserve the liquid and set aside.Fill a deep-fat fryer or large, deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in 1 minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Crack the crab claws to expose most of the flesh and remove the shell. Mix the finely chopped prawns, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil and sherry together to form a paste, or blend in a food processor. Coat the crab claw flesh in the paste.Put the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Coat the crab claws in the flour, then with the eggs and then the breadcrumbs.Deep-fry the claws for 2–4 minutes, or until cooked through. Put them on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain.Mix 150g/5½oz brown crab meat and the nduja paste together. Place a teaspoon of the mixture in the centre of a wonton wrapper and wet the edges. Place another wonton wrapper on top and press down to seal. Use a pastry cutter to cut out a perfect circle. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers to make 12 ravioli.Cook the ravioli in a large pan of boiling salted water for 1–2 minutes or until they rise to the surface. Meanwhile, gently heat the reserved crab stock.To serve, place the white crab meat in the bottom of a serving bowl, add three ravioli, ladle over the stock and top with a claw. Garnish with the coriander.
