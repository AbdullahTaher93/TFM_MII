Preheat the oven to 150C/130C Fan/Gas 2.Season both sides of the turkey escalopes with salt and pepper. In a shallow dish, lightly beat the eggs with the milk. In another dish, mix the brown breadcrumbs with the grated Parmesan, sesame seeds, chopped parsley and a little seasoning.Dip the turkey breast escalopes, one at a time, into the beaten egg, then into the breadcrumb mixture to coat all over.For the green slaw, toss the cabbage, kale, spinach and chopped parsley together in a large bowl.For the dressing, mix the mayonnaise, soured cream, mustard and wine vinegar together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper, then add to the shredded veg. Toss well and set aside.Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. When it is hot, add two of the escalopes and fry for 2â€“3 minutes on each side until golden-brown. Remove and drain on kitchen paper, then transfer to a baking tray and place in the oven to keep warm. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the pan and cook the other escalopes in the same way.Serve the turkey schnitzel straight away, with the green slaw and lemon wedges to squeeze over.
