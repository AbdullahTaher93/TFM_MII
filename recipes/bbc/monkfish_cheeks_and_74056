Put the monkfish, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, lemon zest and olive oil in a sealable bag. Put in the fridge and marinate for 30 minutes.To make the dressing, mix together all the ingredients and season to taste.To make the crisps, heat a deep-fat fryer to 180C (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Using a spiraliser, slice the potato into long thin strips. Deep-fry the strips until crispy, drain on kitchen paper and season with salt and vinegar.To make the mayonnaise, blend the olive oil and tarragon in a food processor to make a green oil. Remove from the blender and set aside. Put the whole egg, egg yolk, mustard and salt into the food processor and blend. Slowly add the green oil, while blending, until thick and creamy. Finish with a squeeze lemon.Heat the oil in a frying pan placed over a high heat. Cook the monkfish for 2â€“4 minutes on each side, until cooked through. Squeeze over half of the lemon juice before removing from the pan.To serve, divide the potato crisps and the monkfish cheeks between two plates. Drizzle with the dressing and scatter over the micro basil leaves. Serve the mayo on the side.
