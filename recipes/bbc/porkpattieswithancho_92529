Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Mix together the pork mince and breadcrumbs in a mixing bowl with the lemon zest and parmesan.  Add the herbs and the anchovies, season with a little salt then more generously with freshly ground black  pepper.Using your hands, mix together well and then form the mixture into 6-8 large patties.Heat the oil in a large frying pan, then fry the patties until brown on both sides. Place in a shallow ovenproof dish and cover with enough stock to come halfway up the pork patties. Cook  in the oven for 20 minutes. They will have crisp tops but be deliciously moist underneath.Serve them in a shallow bowl with some steamed Swiss chard with some of the stock they were  cooked in.
