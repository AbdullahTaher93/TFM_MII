For the beans, soak the borlotti beans overnight in plenty of clean cold water.Drain the beans and transfer to a large pan with three times the volume of water. Add the sage, chilli, garlic and tomatoes.Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer gently for one hour or until the beans are tender (the time may vary depending on the age of the beans).Drain off three-quarters of the cooking liquor then transfer the beans and the remaining cooking liquor into a bowl. Remove and discard the chilli and sage. Remove the garlic, mash with a fork then return to the beans and stir through.Season with salt and black pepper and stir in the olive oil and vinegar.For the squid, peel off the wings and outer membrane and remove the head and intestines. Cut in half lengthways and scrape out the inside with a knife. Wash thoroughly with cold water and pat dry.Lay the squid pieces flat, skin-side down, and score with a sharp knife in a criss-cross pattern.Season the squid with salt and freshly ground black pepper and rub a little olive oil into the skin.Place a non-stick pan over a medium heat. When hot, add the squid, scored side down. Cook for one minute until golden-brown, then turn over.Add the chilli, anchovy fillets, parsley and lemon juice to the pan.Remove the squid and quickly slice into bite-sized pieces. Return immediately to the pan and toss briefly through the other ingredients.To serve, place a spoon of the borlotti bean mixture in the centre of a plate. Place a small amount of rocket on top and then the chopped squid.
