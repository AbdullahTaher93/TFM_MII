First wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh and measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.Rub the flour and butter together in a bowl until you get a fine crumbly mixture.Add the caster sugar and mix. Then tip in most of the milk and mix gently with your fork until it starts to stick together. You may not need all the milk.Sprinkle some flour onto the work surface. Turn the dough out onto the mat and gently make it into a ball, then flatten it with your hands. Make a dip in the middle and place onto the baking tray (itâ€™s harder to move it once the topping is on).Cut the strawberries in half with the table knife; the bigger ones might need cutting again. Put them to one side.Using two teaspoons - one to scoop up, one to scrape off - place the jam in the middle of the dough and spread it out using the back of one teaspoon.Tear two basil leaves into small pieces and sprinkle some on top of the jam.  Add the strawberries on top of the jam.  Finish with the rest of the fresh basil and sprinkle the top with a little demerara sugar. Ask a grown-up to put the strawberry crown into the oven and bake it for 12-15 minutes.Let it cool down a bit before eating as the jam can get very hot! Serve with yoghurt or ice cream.
