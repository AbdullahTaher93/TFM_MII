To make the pizza base, put the flour in a large bowl (or stand mixer) and sprinkle in the yeast. Stir thoroughly before adding the salt. Mix the olive oil with the water, then make a well in the centre of the flour and start pouring it in. Stir until you have a fairly wet dough, then turn out and knead until it is no longer sticky, but soft and pliable.Leave to rise for an hour in a large bowl, covered, then knock back and divide into two large or 4 smaller pieces, depending on the size you are able to cook.When you are ready to cook the pizzas, preheat the oven to its highest setting and either heat baking trays or a pizza stone. Shape the pizzas into large circles, then dust more baking trays with flour and transfer the pizza bases onto them – this is so you can slide them straight onto the baking tray or pizza stone.Make the tomato sauce simply by blending all the tomato sauce ingredients together in a food processor with plenty of salt and pepper.Spread a small amount of the tomato sauce over the pizza base, then top with the pieces of sausage, bacon, black pudding (if using), mushrooms and tomatoes.Break an egg or two on top, making sure that the eggs are contained by other ingredients so that the white doesn’t run off (alternatively you can turn up the edges slightly just to make sure). Sprinkle with mozzarella pieces, then drizzle with olive oil.Bake in the oven for around 8–10 minutes, or until the pizza is crisp and the toppings are cooked.
