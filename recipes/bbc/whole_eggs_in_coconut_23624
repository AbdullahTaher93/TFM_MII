Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan or karahi over a medium heat, add the whole eggs and fry for 1â€“2 minutes, or until lightly coloured, then add the turmeric and chilli powder and cook for another 30 seconds. Stir in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer.Add the onions, ginger, chillies and salt, and simmer for five minutes, or until the coconut milk has reduced in volume by half and the onions are just softened, adding a splash of water if it becomes too thick. Stir in the sugar and coriander and sprinkle with garam masala. Halve the eggs, and serve with rice.
