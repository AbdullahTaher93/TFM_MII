Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Lightly grease a baking tray with butter.Put the flour, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Mix the ingredients together until thoroughly combined. Add 150g/5½oz of the cheese and stir in well.Add the butter to the mixture and rub in using your fingers until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre of the dry mixture and add the eggs and milk gradually. Combine the dry mixture with the wet ingredients to make a soft dough.Lightly flour a work surface, turn out the dough and knead very lightly. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle with a thickness of about 1cm/½in.Scatter the biltong evenly over the surface of the dough.Roll up the dough along the longer side of the rectangle so it resembles a Swiss roll. Cut the dough into slices to make 8–9 good-sized scones.Place the scones on the prepared baking tray and scatter with the remaining cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 15 minutes, or until well risen and golden. Leave to cool slightly before serving.
