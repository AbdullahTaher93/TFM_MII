Whisk together the dairy-free milk, flours, salt and 65ml/2¼fl oz water in a large bowl. Leave the mixture to rest for at least 1 hour.Meanwhile, mix the cream cheese, lemon juice and lemon zest together in a bowl.  Beat until smooth and creamy then store in the fridge until ready to use.Heat a 20-25cm/8-10in non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until hot. Brush lightly with oil and pour in a little of the batter, swirling it around so that it forms a thin layer on the bottom of the pan. If the batter isn’t thin enough you can add a little more liquid to the mixture.When the top of the pancake is dry (about 1 minute) flip the pancake and cook the other side for a further minute, the pancakes should colour just slightly.  Repeat with the remaining batter. You can keep the cooked pancakes warm by wrapping in foil and placing in a low temperature oven.Spread a generous layer of cream cheese over the pancake and top with a slice of smoked salmon, chives, pumpkin seeds and caperberries. Roll the pancake to enclose the filling and serve.
