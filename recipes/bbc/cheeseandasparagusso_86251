Add the asparagus spears and chives, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the grated cheese and stir until melted. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.Add two of the egg yolks to the mixture and beat well (the third egg yolk can be used in another dish).Place the egg whites into a large, clean bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gently fold the egg whites into the cheese mixture.Grease a small ovenproof pan with butter, dust with plain flour and shake out the excess. Spoon the souffl√© mixture into the pan, then transfer to the oven and bake for 6-8 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.Serve immediately in the pan or turned out onto a plate.
