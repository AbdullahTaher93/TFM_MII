Cook until the blueberries have broken down, the sugar has dissolved in the juices, and the mixture has thickened.Just before serving, heat a little butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the pain perdu slices in batches, and fry for 2 minutes on each side until golden-brown and heated through.To serve, divide the pain perdu slices equally among 4-6 serving plates.
