Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan placed over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 3–4 minutes, until soft but not coloured.Add the rice and stir well to coat in the oil. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.Pour in the wine and cook until it’s almost all evaporated. Add a ladleful of stock and stir until the liquid is absorbed completely.Gradually add the remaining stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until all the liquid has absorbed before adding more. This should take around 18–20 minutes.Add the peas with the final ladleful of stock and allow them to heat through.Once the stock is absorbed and the rice is tender but still has a little bite, stir in the smoked salmon, lemon zest, juice and dill.Drizzle over a little olive oil, season with pepper and serve.
