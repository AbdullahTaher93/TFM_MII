Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.For the chicken, heat the olive oil and butter together in an ovenproof frying pan and fry the chicken breast for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown.Squeeze the lemon juice over the top, add the lemon wedges and garlic cloves into the pan and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Transfer to the oven to roast for 10-12 minutes, or until the chicken is golden-brown and cooked through. (The chicken is cooked when the juices run clear when the meat is pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.)Remove the chicken, lemon and garlic cloves from the pan and put the chicken and garlic on a plate, keeping it warm. Reserve the pan and its juices.For the potato and pea mash, cook the potato in a pan of boiling water for 5-7 minutes, or until tender, adding the peas for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking. Drain well and mash with the butter. Keep warm.For the creamy tarragon sauce, deglaze the pan used for cooking the chicken with the wine. Simmer for 4-5 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by about half, then stir in the cream, tarragon and lemon juice. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, spoon the mash onto a serving plate and place the chicken on top. Drizzle the sauce around the edges of the plate.
