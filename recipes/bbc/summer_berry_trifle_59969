Cover the trays with cling film and leave to set in the fridge for about an hour and a half.When the custard has cooled, gently pour on top of the set jelly.Cover with cling film and return the trays to the fridge for a further 30 minutes, or until the custard is lightly set.For the topping, lightly toast the almonds in a dry frying pan over a low heat for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown, keeping the almonds moving around the pan frequently to prevent them from burning.
