Place onto a shallow baking sheet.Heat the golden syrup and 50g/2oz of the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat until melted. Pour into the bottom of the cake tin. Place the pineapple rings on top, pressing 6 around the outside and 1 in the centre. Finely chop the remaining pineapple and set aside.Beat the sugar and the remaining butter together in a bowl and until light and fluffy.Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each egg. Fold in the flour. Stir in the chopped pineapple until well combined.Spoon the cake mixture over the pineapple rings in the tin and tap to settle the mixture.Bake in the oven for 45-60 minutes, or until or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to cool in the tin for 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto a large plate and peel off the greaseproof paper. Serve.
