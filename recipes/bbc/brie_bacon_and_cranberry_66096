Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.Take one sheet of the filo pastry and cover the rest of the pastry with a damp tea towel to stop it drying out. Cut the pastry in half so it is easier to work with. Take one half of the pastry and brush it with a little of the melted butter. Cut this half into 20 rough 5cm/2in squares. Take three of the squares and place them on top of each other, placing each at a slight angle to the one underneath (forming a star shape).Push the stack of pastry squares into one of the holes of a mini muffin tin, to make an empty pastry case. Repeat with the remaining pastry until all 24 holes are filled.Cut the brie into 24 small pieces and place one piece into each pastry case. Dot with a tiny amount of mustard, if using, add a little cranberry sauce and top with a few strips of bacon.Bake for 10â€“12 minutes, or until the bacon is cooked, the cheese melted and the pastry golden-brown. Leave to cool in the tin for a couple of minutes before removing carefully and serving.
