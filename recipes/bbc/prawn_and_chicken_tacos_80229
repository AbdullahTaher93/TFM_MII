Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. To make the tomato mole, heat the oil in a saucepan over a high heat. Add the onion, chillies, garlic and sweetcorn and cook for 5 minutes, until soft. Add the tomatoes, season and stir. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Blend until smooth.Meanwhile, cut the chicken into finger-sized strips. Mix together the crème fraîche and egg and roll the chicken and prawns in the mixture. Crush the corn chips inside their bag. Drop the coated chicken and prawns into the bag and rustle it around so each piece is coated in corn chip crumbs. Leave for 5 minutes, so the corn chips go a little soggy.Heat a little oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and cook the chicken and prawns, in batches, for 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a baking tray  and bake for 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the coating is brown and crisp.In separate bowls, mix together the ingredients for the quick slaw and for the mango salsa.Cut the avocados in half lengthways and remove the seeds. Using a large spoon, scoop out the flesh and put it in a large bowl. Mash the flesh very well with a fork and then mix in the juices, Tabasco and season.To serve, divide the smashed avocado between the tacos. Add the chicken and prawns and top with the tomato mole, quick slaw and mango salsa.
