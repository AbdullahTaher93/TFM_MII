For the glazed grapefruit salad, remove the skins from the pink and white grapefruits, then segment them, catching any excess juice in a bowl (reserve the juice).Arrange the segments alternately in a hollow circle around the edge of four serving plates.Using a chefs' blow torch or a hot grill, heat the grapefruit segments until slightly coloured, then set aside.In a large mixing bowl, whisk together five tablespoons of the reserved grapefruit juice with the caster sugar, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard and the vanilla seeds until well combined. (Any remaining juice will not be required for this recipe.)Gradually whisk in the extra virgin olive oil in a thin stream, until it is well incorporated into the salad dressing. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Place the salad leaves into a bowl, add a little of the salad dressing, to taste, then mix well until the leaves are coated. Divide the salad and place equally into the centre of each of the serving plates.For the fish, heat a griddle pan over a medium heat until hot. Rub the oil all over the salmon and sea bream fillets. Season on both sides, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Place the salmon fillet into the hot griddle pan. Fry for 60 seconds on each side.Add the sea bream fillet, skin-side down, and fry for 45-60 seconds on each side.To serve, place one piece of salmon fillet on top of each portion of salad, then place one piece of sea bream fillet on top. Drizzle over the remaining salad dressing.
