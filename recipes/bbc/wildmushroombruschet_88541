Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.For the bruschetta, heat a griddle pan until hot. Drizzle the olive oil over the slice of ciabatta bread and griddle until golden-brown on both sides. Remove from the pan.In a separate frying pan, heat the butter and gently fry the shallots, mushrooms and garlic until the mushrooms start to colour, about five minutes. Add the cream and simmer until reduced slightly, then stir in the chopped sage and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.For the tomatoes, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan. Add the tomatoes and herbs to the pan and sear on all sides. Sprinkle over the balsamic vinegar and transfer to the oven to cook for about six minutes, or until soft.To serve, place the griddled ciabatta onto a serving plate and top with the mushroom mixture. Place the poached eggs on top and arrange the balsamic tomatoes around the side. Garnish with parsley.
