For the gnocchi, pass the potato through a fine sieve and mix with all the other ingredients.Season with salt and pepper and then knead into a smooth ball using the extra flour. Roll into a long sausage shape and then cut into small pillow shapes.Heat some water until it is gently simmering. Add the gnocchi, and a bit of olive oil. Once the gnocchi have risen to the surface of the water, put them into some cold water to refresh. Drain on a cloth and set aside.For the pesto, blanch the basil in boiling water, pat dry, then blend with all of the other ingredients, except the lemon zest, for 30-45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper and add the lemon zest, if using.For the lamb, preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3Â½.Put the lamb in a large ovenproof pan with the oil and heat to render down the fat. Colour nicely all over and add the butter, thyme and garlic. Put in the oven for 6-8 minutes and then remove and leave to rest. Reheat in the oven for 3 minutes and then slice into chops.For the vegetables, score the aubergine with a knife and sprinkle with a little salt and leave for 3-4 minutes to remove the moisture.Heat a pan, add the olive oil and fry the aubergines until soft, add the courgettes and let them colour a little. Add a drizzle of sherry vinegar. Finally add the tomatoes, wild garlic leaves and some pesto. Add a little water and season. All vegetables should have a slight bite to them and be well coated in the pesto.To serve, put the vegetables and gnocchi in the centre of a large serving plate and top with the lamb and  a little more pesto.
