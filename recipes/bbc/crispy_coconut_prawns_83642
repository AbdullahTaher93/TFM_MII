To make the dipping sauce, place all the ingredients into a food processer and blend until smooth. Pour into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook gently over a low heat for 5 minutes. If the sauce gets too thick, add a few tablespoons of boiling water.To make the batter, sift 125g/4½oz plain flour, the baking powder and pinch salt into a bowl. Make a well in centre and break in the egg. Bring in the flour from the sides to make a paste then whisk in the cold water to make a smooth batter.Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Tip the remaining 50g/1¾oz flour into a shallow bowl and season generously with salt and pepper. Mix together the breadcrumbs and coconut in a seperate bowl.Coat each prawn in the flour, shaking off any excess, then holding it by the tail, dip it into the batter. Lift it out and let any excess batter drip back into the bowl. Roll the prawn in the coconut crumbs, pressing down so the mixture sticks. Put the prawn on the prepared tray and repeat until all are coated, leaving space between each one.Deep-fry the prawns in batches for 1 or 2 minutes until golden-brown and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.Serve at once with the papaya dipping sauce.
