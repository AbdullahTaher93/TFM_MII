Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Line a 12-hole muffin tray with cases.Put the sponge ingredients into a bowl and whisk using an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy. Spoon the mixture evenly between the cases. Bake for 18–20 minutes or until golden-brown, risen and springy to the touch. Set aside to cool completely.Cut a deep circle in the centre of each cake (about the width of a £2 coin) and pull out a walnut size of sponge to leave a hole. Spoon 1 teaspoon lemon curd into each hole, making sure the curd is level with the top.To make the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a large bowl with an electric hand whisk until stiff. Gradually add the sugar as you continue whisking on full speed, until you have a stiff glossy mixture. Spread or pipe on the top of each cupcake and sit back in their tins.Use a chef’s blowtorch to brown the meringues or slide the tray under the grill. Watch carefully and remove when golden-brown.Sprinkle with the freeze-dried strawberries.
