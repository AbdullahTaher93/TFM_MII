Mix together all of the sauce ingredients in a bowl and add the pork. Mix well to combine, then cover with cling film and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight.To cook the pork, heat a wok until smoking and add the groundnut oil. Add the sliced pork (reserving the marinade) and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, or until browned. Add the reserved marinade and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and sticky.For the caramelised onions, heat the groundnut oil in a small wok or pan, add the red onions and stir-fry for 4-5 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Add the black rice vinegar and the brown sugar, stirring well, and leave to cook for 2-3 minutes, or until caramelised.To serve, fill the buns with some salad leaves. Top with slices of the sticky pork, some caramelised onions and sliced tomatoes, if using. Serve immediately.
