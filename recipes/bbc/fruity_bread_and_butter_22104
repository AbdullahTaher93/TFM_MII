Butter a large shallow ovenproof pie dish. Butter the brioche slices and cut in half on the diagonal. Arrange a layer of the slices, butter side up, in the dish. Put 100g/3½oz of the raspberries in a small bowl and sprinkle with the raspberry liqueur if using and 2 tablespoons of the caster sugar. Crush very lightly, then spoon this over the brioche layer.Sprinkle over a few more whole raspberries. Top with the remaining brioche slices, then arrange the remaining raspberries over the brioche, tucking a few in between the slices as well as leaving a fair few on top.Whisk the remaining sugar with the eggs, then add the milk, double cream and orange zest. Make sure everything is well combined, then pour this mixture over the brioche and raspberries.Leave the pudding to stand for around half an hour. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Dot the pudding with a few knobs of butter, then sprinkle over the demerara sugar.Bake in the oven for 35–45 minutes, or until well set, golden-brown and lightly toasted in places. Eat hot or cold.
