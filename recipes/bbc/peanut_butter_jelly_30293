Put the jam into a microwave-safe bowl and heat it in 10-second bursts, stirring each time until the mixture is simply liquid enough to swirl around – it does not need to be warm. Repeat this process with the peanut butter (make sure to avoid putting in too much oil from the jar as this will just make the pancakes greasy). Set both aside.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C/Gas 4 and spray a brownie tin (about 18x23cm/7x9in) with cooking oil.Put the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar into a bowl and whisk together.Make a well in the centre and add the milk, along with the eggs and oil. Whisk together until you have a thick batter.Pour the batter into the prepared brownie tin and spread out evenly.Take dollops of the jam and spoon them in sporadically, then do the same for the peanut butter. With the end of a spoon, swirl the dollops together slightly to create a marbled effect.Bake in the oven for 10–15 minutes. As soon as the surface of the pancake looks shiny and not wobbly anymore, it is ready. Remove from the oven and cut into squares. Dust with icing sugar, if liked, and serve.
