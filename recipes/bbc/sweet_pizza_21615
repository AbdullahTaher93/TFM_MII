For the sweet pizza dough, mix the yeast with the warm milk in a large mixing bowl. Mix in the flour, sugar, eggs and salt. Mix well to form a soft dough. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Add the butter to the dough and knead for a few more minutes, until the butter is incorporated.Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. When the dough has risen, knock it back, then knead again until smooth. Divide into 12 balls. Roll out each ball on a lightly floured work surface into a 20cm/8in circle and place each dough circle on a baking tray.For the topping, brush the top of each pizza with the egg yolk. Cover each pizza base with the crème fraîche and then sprinkle on the toppings of your choice.Bake each pizza in the oven at 220C/200C Fan/Gas 8 for 10–12 minutes. Garnish with the herbs and serve.
