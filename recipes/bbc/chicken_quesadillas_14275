Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and line two baking trays with baking parchment.Put the shredded chicken into a bowl. Heat a small frying pan over a high heat, then add the coriander and cumin seeds and toast for 30 seconds to one minute until fragrant. Remove from the heat. Using a pestle and mortar, crush the seeds, then sprinkle them over the shredded chicken and toss to coat the pieces.Tip the kidney beans into a bowl and mash lightly with a fork. Add the spring onions, sweetcorn, chipotle paste and a little salt and pepper. Mix well.Place two tortillas on each of the lined baking trays. Spray or brush them with a little oil and flip each tortilla over. Spread the kidney bean mixture evenly over the four tortillas, top with the chicken and sprinkle with the grated cheeses. Top each one with another tortilla, press down well and spray the surface with a few sprays of oil (or brush with oil if you prefer). Cook in the oven for 10–12 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are golden-brown.Meanwhile, for the salad, toss the lettuce, rocket and tomatoes together with the lime juice, extra virgin olive oil and some salt and pepper.Remove the quesadillas from the oven, cut into wedges and pile onto a plate. Finish with a dollop of soured cream, coriander leaves and sliced jalapeños if you like it spicy. Serve the salad alongside.
