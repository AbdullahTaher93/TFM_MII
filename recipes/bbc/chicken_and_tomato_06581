Cut four circles from the pastry using a cookie cutter.Using a pastry brush, dab water around the edges of each pastry circle.Divide the filling mixture equally among the four pastry circles.Fold each pastry circle over itself to create four parcels, pinching the edges together to seal. Place each parcel onto a baking tray and dab with a little more water.
