Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/Gas 4.Grease a 30cm/12in square ovenproof dish.Place the plums and lemon juice into the bottom of the dish and sprinkle with the sugar.For the crumble, in a bowl, rub together the flour, caster sugar, muscovado sugar and cold butter cubes. (It is important that the butter is cold, or you will end up making more of a dough than a crumble.) When a crumble has been achieved, add in the oats and lemon zest. Mix well.Sprinkle the crumble mixture over the plum mixture in the dish, then bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the topping is golden-brown.To serve, spoon out generous portions into bowls and serve with lashings of custard.
