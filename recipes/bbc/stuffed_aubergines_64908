Brush the inside of the aubergines with olive oil and season with salt. Place in a baking tin and cover with foil. Bake for 20 minutes.Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a pan. Add the onion and fry gently over a medium heat for 10 minutes, or until softened.Increase the heat, add the garlic and aubergine flesh and stir until the aubergine has lightly browned. Add the herbs, chilli flakes, if using, and the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine, reduce the heat and cover.Simmer for 10 minutes, remove the lid and continue to cook until any liquid has evaporated.Spoon the mixture into the aubergine halves. Mix the breadcrumbs with the cheese, lemon zest and basil, and season with a little salt and pepper. Sprinkle this over the stuffed aubergines, and drizzle with more olive oil.Bake the aubergines, uncovered, for 25–30 minutes, or until the filling is hot and the top has lightly browned. Serve.
