Measure the flour into a large clean jam jar. Add the egg and milk and a pinch of salt then place the lid on firmly and shake well until the pancake mixture is smooth.Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat and swirl it around the pan, then tip the oil into a heatproof bowl.Pour a tenth of the batter into the pan and swirl it around so that it covers the base of the pan in a thin even layer. Cook for 45â€“60 seconds until firm and just golden, then flip over and cook on the other side for another 15 seconds.Tip out onto a plate and repeat with the remaining oil and batter, wiping the pan out with kitchen paper between each one.Scatter whichever toppings you fancy over the top, then fold into quarters or roll up into a pinwheel and eat straight away.
