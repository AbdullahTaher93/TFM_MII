For the mint aïoli, combine all the ingredients in a bowl, cover and set aside.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.For the burgers, put the onion, garlic, apricots, cumin and mint leaves into a food processor and pulse until coarsely ground.Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the minced lamb, breadcrumbs, harissa, feta and salt. Combine until thoroughly mixed: the best way to do this is using your hands. Fry a teaspoon of the mixture to test the seasoning: taste and adjust with a little more salt if necessary. Divide the mixture into four and shape into burgers.Heat a little oil in a large ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the burgers and fry for 3–4 minutes on each side until evenly browned. Put the pan into the oven to bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the burgers are just cooked through.To serve, put some of the shredded lettuce and pomegranate seeds (if using) onto the base of each burger bun. Top with a burger, some cucumber and mint aïoli and the remaining half of the bun. Serve immediately.
