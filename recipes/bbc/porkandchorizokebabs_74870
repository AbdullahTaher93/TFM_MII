Preheat the grill.Trim the pork tenderloin of any excess fat and cut into 12 even sized pieces.Thread four skewers alternately with a piece of the pork, a baby new potato and a slice of chorizo. (Use 3 potatoes, 3 pork pieces and 2 chorizo slices per skewer.)Mix the lemon juice, olive oil and finely chopped rosemary together and brush over the kebabs. Cook under the grill for 10-12 minutes, turning once, until tender and cooked through.Meanwhile cook the broad beans for 4-5 minutes in boiling water until just tender. Drain and refresh under cold running water.Put broad beans into a bowl and toss with the chopped mint leaves, plenty of extra virgin olive oil and salt and freshly ground black pepper.Transfer to a serving platter and top with crumbled feta.Arrange the hot kebabs on top and serve.
