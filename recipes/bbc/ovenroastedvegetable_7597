Firstly, wash all the root vegetables but don't peel them. Then slice into large chunky slices. Cut the lemon in half and cut the red onions into quarters.Place all the vegetables into an oven tray and drizzle with olive oil and honey. Add some sprigs of fresh thyme and season well. Place in a preheated oven 180C/350F/Gas 4 for 30-40 minutes to cook all the vegetables. Remove from the oven from time to time to coat all the vegetables in the glaze and serve.
