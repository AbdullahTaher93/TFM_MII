Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.On a floured surface, roll out the puff pastry and cut into four rounds about 6-8in in diameter. Score a line about 1cm/0.5in from the edge of the pastry and prick the base to stop it from rising.Place the rounds on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Place the diced cheese on the pastry, then place the figs on top. Lay over the slices of pancetta. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil.Brush the edges of the tart with some beaten egg and place in the oven for about 10 minutes. Remove and pour a little of the double cream onto each tart and sprinkle with the coriander leaves. Place back in the oven for about another 5-6 minutes.Remove from the oven and serve with the salad dressed in a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
