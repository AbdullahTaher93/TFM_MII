For the roasted lamb rump, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Rub the rumps all over with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a frying pan until very hot and add the lamb rumps. Seal on each side until browned all over. Transfer the rumps to a roasting pan and cook in the oven for a further 15â€“20 minutes, or until cooked to your preference. Leave to rest for 20 minutes before serving.For the risotto, melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium heat and sweat the shallots, without browning, for 2 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook for a further 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and stir until completely absorbed. Lower the heat and gradually add 300ml/10fl oz of water, stirring in between each addition. Cook slowly for around 15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through. Remove from the heat, add the cheese and a knob of butter and season with salt and pepper. Stir gently until everything is fully combined.For the sorrel sauce, put the stock, wine and tea in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half and then add the butter.
