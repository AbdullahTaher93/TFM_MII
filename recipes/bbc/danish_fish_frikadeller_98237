Combine the fish with the cream, lemon zest, egg, flour, salt and pepper in a food processor and pulse until combined. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the chopped dill and capers. The mixture will be a bit sticky.With lightly floured hands divide into 8 to 12 portions – depending on what size you want the frikadeller – and form into flat patties.Heat the butter until foaming and fry the patties for 4-5 minutes on each side until golden-brown. Keep warm.For the mayonnaise, put the egg, vinegar and salt into a blender or food processor. Turn on the machine and very slowly trickle the oil through the hole in the lid until you have a thick emulsion. To make mayonnaise by hand, ensure all the ingredients are at room temperature.  Put the egg, vinegar and salt into a mixing bowl. Lightly whisk the yolks to break them and, using a wire whisk, beat the oil in a few drops at a time until it is all incorporated. Once you have added the same volume of oil as the original mixture of egg and vinegar, you can add the oil a little more quickly.Mix together all the ingredients for the remoulade, folding in the whipped cream at the end. Serve alongside the frikadeller.
