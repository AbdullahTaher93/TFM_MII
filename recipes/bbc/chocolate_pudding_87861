Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3. Grease the inside of an ovenproof dish with a little butter and set aside.Cream the measured butter with 225g/8oz of the soft light brown sugar until pale and light, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula from time to time.Gradually add the beaten eggs, mixing well between each addition and then add the vanilla extract and mix again to combine.Sift the flour, 40g/1¾oz cocoa, bicarbonate of soda and a pinch of salt into the mixture and mix again until just combined.Add the milk and mix again until smooth. Spoon the mixture into the prepared dish and level with the back of a spoon.In a small bowl mix together the remaining 75g/2½oz soft light brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and 6 tablespoons hot water. Spoon this chocolatey syrup over the chocolate sponge mixture and place the dish in a large, deep roasting tin.Boil the kettle and pour boiling water into the tin, around the dish so that the water comes halfway up the sides of the dish. Carefully slide the roasting tin into the oven on the middle shelf.Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the pudding is well-risen, the top is nicely cracked and a skewer inserted into the middle of the pudding comes out with a moist crumb.Dust with icing sugar and serve immediately with double cream.
