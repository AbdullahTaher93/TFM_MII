Preheat the oven to 140C/280F/Gas 1. Line two baking trays with parchment paper.Put the egg whites into a large spotlessly clean bowl with a pinch of salt. Whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually add the caster sugar, one tablespoon at a time, whisking between each addition, until it has all been added and the meringue is satiny and forms stiff peaks when the whisk is lifted from the mixture.Fold in the vanilla extract with a large metal spoon. Using a piping bag fitted with a 1½cm/¾in nozzle or a spoon, pipe or scoop the mixture into individual meringues about 7cm/2¾in wide onto the prepared baking trays.For the ripple colour effect, dip a wooden or metal skewer into the food colouring and swirl it through each meringue.Bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Test one by lifting and gently pressing on the base of a meringue – it should be crisp but give way with a bit of pressure – they will crisp more when cooling. Turn off the oven, and leave to cool in the oven with the oven door slightly ajar for best results. If possible, let them cool completely in the oven.When ready to serve, make the raspberry cream. Put the raspberries or blueberries and sugar in a food processor and blend until smooth. Push the mixture through a sieve into a bowl to remove the pips. Fold as much purée as you wish through the whipped cream, leaving it rippled if you like.Dollop a generous tablespoon of the cream on one half of the meringue and sandwich together with another meringue. Serve any remaining purée on the side.
