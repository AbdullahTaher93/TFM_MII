Fill a shallow pasta bowl, slightly wider than your spring roll wrappers, with warm water. Soak a wrapper until its markings disappear, then remove immediately. Wrappers that are only just soft enough to wrap are easier to work with as they don’t tear as easily.Lay the wrapper on a very clean surface. A third of the way up from the bottom, arrange a few cucumber batons, an avocado slice and  a few spinach leaves, chives and strawberry slices. If the strawberries are on the bottom, you’ll be able to see them on the outside of each roll.Carefully fold the bottom of the roll over so that the fillings are sealed inside. Fold both sides in so your summer roll is at the bottom and a rectangular flap at the top. Tightly roll the whole thing up like a burrito. Repeat with the remaining five wrappers; you might need to change the water halfway through.To make the dipping sauce, combine the yogurt and soy sauce and season to taste with lemon or lime juice.
