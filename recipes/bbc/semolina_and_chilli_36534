To make the salad, put the cucumber on a chopping board and smash several times with a rolling pin. Cut it in half, scoop out the seeds and finely chop into batons. Add the vinegar and sugar to a small bowl and stir until dissolved. Add the cucumber and onion wedges and toss to coat. Set aside in the fridge, covered, for at least 10 minutes, or up to 8 hours.For the squid, heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 190C (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.). Cut the body pouch of each squid open along one side and score the inner side with the tip of a small, sharp knife into a fine diamond pattern. Then cut each pouch lengthways in half, then across into 5cm/2in pieces. Separate the tentacles into pairs.Put the cornflour, semolina, paprika and a teaspoon of salt into a plastic freezer bag. Add the prepared squid and then toss to coat. Tip out onto a tray, knocking off any excess and leave for 1-2 minutes so that the cornflour mixture becomes slightly damp. This will give a crispier finish. When the oil reaches 190C, fry the squid for 1-2 minutes, or until browned all over. You might have to do this in batches.To serve, heat a little oil in a wok or frying pan. Quickly saut√© the chilli and spring onions for a couple of minutes, or until sizzling. Season to taste. Drain the squid on kitchen paper and then tip onto a platter. Sprinkle over the chilli mixture and arrange bowls of the smacked cucumber salad at both ends of the platter.
