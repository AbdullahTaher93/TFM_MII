Remove and rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, heat a deep-fat fryer to 170C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Slice the artichokes into 3–4 slices each and dry thoroughly.

Season well with salt, pepper and some lemon juice.Serve the lamb, thickly sliced with the pesto and artichokes on the side.
