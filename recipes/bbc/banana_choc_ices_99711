Put the bananas, yoghurt and vanilla extract into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into eight mini ice-cream silicone moulds. Insert a lolly stick into each one and place in the freezer for at least 3 hours until frozen solid.When the lollies are frozen, place the chocolate and coconut oil in a small heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water; make sure the base of the bowl isn’t touching the water. Stir over a low heat until melted. Remove from the heat and leave until cool to the touch, but still runny.Line a tray with baking paper or a non-stick silicone mat. Take the banana lollies from the freezer.Working quickly, dip one lolly at a time into the melted chocolate and turn to coat all over. Lift out and sprinkle with your choice of topping. Place on the prepared tray; the chocolate will set almost instantly. Repeat with the remaining ice lollies. Eat straight away or return to the freezer until you’re ready to serve.
