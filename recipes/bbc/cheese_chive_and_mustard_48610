Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Lightly flour a baking tray.Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and mustard into a bowl.Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. (You can do this quickly in a food processor.)Grate half of the cheese very finely, and roughly chop the other half. Stir into the flour mixture with the chopped chives.Gradually add milk to make a soft but not sticky dough (you may not need all the milk).Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead lightly, then roll the dough out into a thickness of just less than 2.5cm/1in. Use a 6cm/2Â½in cutter to cut the scones, re-rolling the off-cuts as necessary.  Handle the dough as little as possible to keep it light.Put the scones onto the floured baking tray, allowing at least 2.5cm/1in between them and glaze with the egg and milk mixture.Bake for 10 minutes or until risen and golden brown.To serve, finely slice the russet apples and fan half a dozen slices on the plate with the cheese scone and a small pat of butter.
