Tip into a bowl and add half of the chopped coriander.For the dressing, make the dressing by mixing all the ingredients together in a jam jar and shake.Drain the rice if necessary and add to the bowl with the vegetables.  Add the dressing, taste and season with more salt and pepper if necessary. Serve with the remaining coriander scattered on top.
