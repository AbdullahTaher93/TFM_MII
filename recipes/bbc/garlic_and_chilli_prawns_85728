Peel the prawns, leaving the tip of the tail and the head intact.Pour the olive oil into a large frying pan and set over a medium heat. Add the garlic, parsley, chilli flakes and a large pinch of sea salt and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly, until the garlic starts to soften but isnâ€™t taking much colour on.Turn up the heat and add the prawns, frying briskly on each side until they are pink and cooked through. This will take up to 3 minutes.Carefully remove the prawns from the frying pan with a slotted spoon. Serve immediately with some of the flavoured cooking oil drizzled over, with lemon wedges and perhaps some bread for dipping.
