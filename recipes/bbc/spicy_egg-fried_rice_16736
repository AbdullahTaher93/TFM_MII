Rinse the rice in a sieve under cold water until it runs clear then place into a large, lidded saucepan. Cover with enough boiling water so that it rises about 1 inch above the top of the rice. Bring it to the boil over a high heat, crumble over the stock cube and half the curry powder. Place the lid on tight and turn the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes and then turn the heat off. Leave the lid on.Meanwhile, in a large frying pan or a wok over a high heat add the oil until hot. Tip the eggs in and it should sizzle. Cook the omelette until just set, roll it up and set aside on a plate. When cool enough to touch, slice the rolled omelette into strips.Meanwhile, add a bit more oil to the wok and cook the broccoli, peas, carrots and garlic over a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the remaining curry powder and chillies and cook for 1 minute. Tip in the rice and toss very gently. Serve immediately topped with the omelette strips.
