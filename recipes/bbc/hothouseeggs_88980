Cut a hole about the size of an egg yolk in the centre of the slice of bread.Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the bread and fry the bread and the cut-out round on both sides for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown.Just before the bread is fully fried on the second side, crack the egg into the hole in the bread. Fry for 1-2 minutes, then carefully flip the toast and egg over and fry on the other side for one more minute, or until the egg is cooked to your liking.Slide the toast onto a serving plate and serve with the toasted round on the side. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately.
