For the flatbreads, measure the flour, oil and water into a large bowl and add a good pinch of salt. Mix everything together with a table knife and then use your hands to bring the mixture together into a soft dough. Tip onto a floured work surface and knead for 4–5 minutes.Flatten the dough into a circle, sprinkle over the garlic and herbs and then bring together into a ball again. Knead until the garlic and herbs are well incorporated.Divide into six even-sized balls. On a floured work surface, use a rolling pin to roll each ball out into a very thin circle.Heat a large frying pan until very hot, then rub some oil into the pan using kitchen paper. Add one flatbread and fry for 2 minutes until it starts to puff up and turn lightly golden. Use a palette knife to flip over the flatbread and cook for another 2–3 minutes on the other side. Repeat with the remaining flatbreads, adding a little more oil to the pan if needed.For the carrot hummus, place all the ingredients in a food processor, season with salt and pepper and whizz until just smooth and creamy. Serve with the warm flatbreads.
