Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with foil and brush with vegetable oil.To make the parcel sauce, heat the oil in a small saucepan and fry the chilli and garlic for 30 seconds. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce and fish sauce. Cook for 2–3 minutes, or until thickened and glossy, stirring constantly.To make the filling, put the salmon fillet in a bowl and season with a little salt and pepper. Add chilli powder and turmeric and mix together. Heat the oil in a small frying pan and gently fry the ginger and garlic for 1 minute. Season with a pinch of salt and add the spring onions and coriander. Mix together and remove from the heat.Take a spring roll wrapper and dip quickly into a bowl of cold water. Put on a lightly wetted plate and place a few shredded pieces of lettuce down the centre. Top with a few sticks of carrot and pepper, making sure they are all facing the same direction.Place 3–4 pieces of salmon on top and add a little of the spring onion mixture. Spoon over a little of the sauce. Fold in the ends of the spring roll wrapper and then roll up. Place on the lined tray. Repeat with the remaining wrappers, filling and sauce. (Discard the chilli and halved garlic cloves.)Bake the parcels for 10 minutes, or until the salmon is just cooked. Arrange on a plate and eat warm.
