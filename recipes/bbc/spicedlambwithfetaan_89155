Remove from the pan and leave to rest for five minutes, then cut into thick slices.For the feta and Baby Gem salad, toss the Baby Gem lettuce leaves with the olive oil. Heat a griddle pan until smoking, then add the lettuce and fry for 15-20 seconds on each side, or until tender. Mix the chargrilled lettuce together with the feta, lemon zest and juice and olives. Drizzle over some olive oil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well.For the lemon pilaf, heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion and garlic and fry for 4-5 five minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Add the lemon zest and the rice, stirring to coat in the oil. Gradually add the hot chicken stock and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring frequently, or until all of the stock has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir in the chopped mint.To serve, place the salad onto two serving plates, top each with the sliced lamb and serve the lemon pilaf on the side.
