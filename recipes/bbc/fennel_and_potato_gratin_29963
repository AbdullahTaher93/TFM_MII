Cut the onions into six wedges too in a similar way.Cut the potatoes into wedges the same size as the fennel wedges.Boil the fennel and onions in a large pan of salted water for about five minutes, then add the potatoes and boil for a further five minutes, or until the potatoes and fennel are just tender.
