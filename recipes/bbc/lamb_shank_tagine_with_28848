Remove the lamb shanks from the pan and set aside.Add the remaining olive oil to the same pan and fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the lamb shanks back to the pan and stir well, then add all of the remaining tagine ingredients - except for the coriander and salt and freshly ground black pepper - and bring to a simmer.Reduce the heat, cover the pan with a lid and place in the oven for two hours, or until the lamb is tender.Remove the lid and cook for a further 30 minutes, or until the tagine is slightly thickened.

Add the red onion, pistachios, lemon juice, pomegranate, olive oil and herbs and mix well. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, divide the tabbouleh among four serving plates, and then spoon the lamb shank tagine alongside and sprinkle the coriander and preserved lemon over the top and serve.
