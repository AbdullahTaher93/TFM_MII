To make the wellingtons, heat the butter and the oil in a pan and gently fry the shallot for 10 minutes until soft. Add the garlic, mushrooms and chestnuts and fry for a further 10 minutes until golden and tender. Season well and stir in the breadcrumbs and parsley. Allow to cool.Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.Unravel one of the pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface. In the middle of each piece of pastry, layer two thirds of the jamón to form a 15cm/6inx20cm/8 in rectangle. Spoon the cooled mushroom and chestnut mix on top of the jamón, shaping it into a large sausage to keep it contained. Cover the filling with the remaining jamón.Brush the edges around the filling with egg, then layer the second puff sheet on top, pressing well around the filling to seal. Trim the edges and crimp with your index fingers. Gently lift and place on a baking sheet then brush all over with egg. Prick the pastry with a fork to allow steam to escape, then and bake for 20–25 minutes until golden and puffed.Meanwhile, toss the chicory with the orange segments, walnuts and flowers. Drizzle with a little lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil and seasoning. Serve the wellington in slices, with the bitter leaf salad on the side.
