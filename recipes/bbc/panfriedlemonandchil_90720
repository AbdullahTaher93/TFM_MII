For the haddock, mix together the chilli powder, mixed spice, paprika, salt and freshly ground black pepper and rub the mixture into the fish.Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the haddock, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Turn the fish over and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the fish is golden-brown all over and cooked through. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice.To serve, place the mixed fresh herbs on a serving plate and place the fish on top. Garnish with the lemon half and a sprinkle of chilli powder.
