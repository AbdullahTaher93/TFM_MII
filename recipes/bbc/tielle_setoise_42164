Add the white wine, tomatoes, black olives and sugar. Cook over a low heat for one hour (the mixture needs to stew together well). Allow to cool and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Combine the paprika with the remaining olive oil and set aside.Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking paper.From the pastry roll out two circles about 20cm/8in wide and about 3mm/1/8 inch thick. Put one piece of pastry on the prepared tray. Spread the squid mixture over the pastry, leaving a 1cm/½in border all around. Glaze the edges with the egg yolk. Cover with the second piece of pastry and seal the two rounds of pastry dough together by pinching the edges, and then roll them inward so they stick together.Brush the tielle with the paprika oil and bake for 30 minutes.For the fennel and mint salad, place the sliced fennel and mint leaves in a bowl.Put the lemon zest and juice in a small glass bowl along with the oil and whisk.Pour the dressing over the fennel and mint and mix together.To serve, place the tielle sétoise on a serving board and pile the salad next to it.
