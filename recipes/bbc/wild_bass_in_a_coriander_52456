Preheat a deep-fat fryer to 160C/325F (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Dust the sea bass portions with rice flour and set aside.For the batter, mix together the flours and baking powder in a large bowl. Whisk in the sparkling water to make a smooth batter. Then stir through the chilli, coriander and sea salt. Set aside until ready to cook the fish.For the chips, cut the potatoes into fairly thin chips. In a large pan of boiling water, cook the chips until just soft, but not breaking up (approximately two minutes). Remove from the pan and drain thoroughly.Add the chips to the deep-fat fryer and cook until they are light golden-brown (approximately two minutes). Drain on kitchen paper and set aside (ready for a second frying just before serving).For the samphire, bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Add the samphire and cook for a few minutes. Immediately drain and coat with butter and balsamic vinegar. Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar.For the sauce gribiche, first make a mayonnaise by placing the whole egg into a food processor along with the Dijon mustard, salt and pepper. Blend until smooth and, with the motor running, add the rapeseed oil in a thin stream until the mixture starts to thicken. Then add the lemon juice and white wine vinegar. Keep adding the oil until you have a smooth emulsion with a mayonnaise consistency.Spoon the mayonnaise into a bowl and add the chopped hard-boiled eggs, cornichons, capers, herbs and sugar. Mix well and set aside.To cook the bass, dredge the fillets in the batter and place them into the deep-fat fryer. Cook for 5-10 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden-brown.Just before serving, fry the chips for a final time until crisp and a deep golden-brown.To serve, place the fried bass and chips on plates with the samphire and gribiche.
