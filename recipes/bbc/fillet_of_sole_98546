For the fish, preheat the grill to high and lightly oil a baking tray.Place a pan of water on the hob and add the new potatoes, bring to the boil and cook for 10-12 minutes until soft.Place the fish down and score the back of the fish gently where the skin was, this will help stop it curling up as it cooks.Place the seasoned flour and clarified butter on separate plates. Now lay the fish in the seasoned flour, shake off any excess and then dip in the clarified butter. Ensure both sides of the fillet are coated. Now dredge the fish through the breadcrumbs.Place the fish on the prepared baking tray, sprinkle with a little more clarified butter and put under the grill to cook. It will not take long, maybe five minutes at the most.Drain the potatoes and toss through the diced butter, salt and pepper and chopped parsley.For the sauce base, place the egg yolks in a large bowl, add a pinch of salt and the vinegar and whisk with the mustard until light in colour, fluffy and thickened a little.Slowly drizzle in the sunflower oil very steadily, whisking all the time. When all mixed, check the seasoning and divide between two bowls.For the remoulade sauce, add the remoulade ingredients to one of the bowls of egg and oil mixture, mix well and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.For the tartare sauce, add the tartare ingredients to the other bowl, mix well, and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, lay your fish on serving plates with a spoonful of the new potatoes and a lemon wedge. Add the sauces on the side. Great served with a simple green salad.
