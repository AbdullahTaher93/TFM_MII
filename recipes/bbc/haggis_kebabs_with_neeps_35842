Preheat the barbecue for direct grilling or a grill to hot.Combine the haggis and sausagemeat together in a bowl. Divide into 12 equal pieces and roll into balls. Thread three balls onto each skewer, place on a plate or tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until firm.To make the neeps and tatties, boil the swede and potatoes in a large pan of salted water for 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and leave in the saucepan with the lid off to steam dry for 10–15 minutes.Pass the swede and potatoes through a potato ricer or push through a coarse sieve into a large bowl. Stir in the butter until melted, then stir in the flour and a plenty of salt and pepper.Set a cast iron pan over the barbecue to heat, or heat on the hob. Pat the potato mixture into a large round, or divide into quarters and pat into smaller rounds. Heat a splash of oil in the pan, add a knob of butter and heat until foaming. Fry the potato cake for 4–5 minutes on each side until golden-brown, then remove from the pan. If you make a larger cake, leave to rest for 2 minutes then cut into wedges.Meanwhile, grill the haggis kebabs for 8–10 minutes, turning regularly. Towards the end of cooking, mix the honey and whisky together in a small bowl and brush over the kebabs.Remove the kebabs from the heat, give them a final brush of the glaze, then serve with the potato cake wedges.
