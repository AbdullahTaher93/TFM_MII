For the pasta, place the flour, eggs and salt into a food processor and blend until the mixture comes together as a dough.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for an hour, if time allows.Feed the pasta through a pasta machine, beginning on the thickest setting and working down to the thinnest setting. Slice into thin spaghetti using the pasta cutter on the machine.For the ragù, heat the oil in a frying pan and add the onion and bacon. Fry gently until soft, then add the mushrooms and garlic and stir well.Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half.Add the cream and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes, then drain and mix with the mushroom ragù.To serve, divide the spaghetti between two serving bowls.
