Melt a knob of butter in a frying pan placed over a medium heat.  Add the spinach and cook for 1–2 minutes, until wilted. Season with salt and pepper. Tip out onto a plate and set aside.In a bowl, beat the eggs until just mixed. Return the frying pan to a medium–high heat, add the remaining butter and melt until beginning to foam, then swirl it around the pan.Pour in the beaten eggs, then tilt the pan to distribute the eggs evenly.  Leave for 20 seconds, until the eggs begin to bubble.Working quickly, use a spatula or wooden spoon to draw in the sides of the eggs to the centre, incorporating the butter. Gently shake the pan to redistribute the egg to the edges.Sprinkle over the cheese and spinach while the egg is still slightly runny in the middle, then remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will continue to cook the egg. Season with salt and pepper.Using a spatula, fold one third of the omelette into the middle, then turn the omelette onto a warm plate folding over itself. Serve immediately.
