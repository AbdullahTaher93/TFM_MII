Melt three-quarters the butter with the oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the spinach and tomatoes and season. Stir, cover with a lid, turn down the heat and cook for 2–3 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted.Push the vegetables around the edge of the pan into a wide ring with a gap in the middle for the eggs, like a nest.Melt the remaining butter in the centre of the pan and let it mix with some of the juices that have come out of the vegetables. Break the eggs into the middle. Cover and cook until the eggs are done to your liking (3–4 minutes for a runny yolk and 5–6 minutes for firm).Meanwhile, toast the bread on both sides.Season the egg and squeeze over the lemon juice. Serve immediately with the toast.
