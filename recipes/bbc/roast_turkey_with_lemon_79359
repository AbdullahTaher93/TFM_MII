Mix the butter, parsley, lemon juice, tarragon with a little salt and pepper and transfer to a piping bag. Pipe between the skin and the flesh of the bird. Put the garlic cloves, thyme, whole lemon and bay inside the cavity of the turkey.Cook the turkey upright until the juices run clear when the meat is pierced in the thickest part. For a 5kg/11lb bird this will take 2½–3 hours. Leave to rest for at least fifteen minutes before carving.
