In a paella pan, heat the olive oil and fry the chicken pieces for 1-2 minutes.Add then add the garlic and tomatoes and fry for a couple more minutes.Sprinkle in the rice. NOTE: Do not stir the ingredients, just shake them.Add a good pinch of saffron, and pour on up to 1 litre/1¾ pints of boiling chicken stock (about 1cm/½in above the level of the rice). Bring to a gentle simmer for 10 minutes.Finally add the prawns, the mussels,  the cherry tomatoes and broad beans.  Season and simmer for 10 minutes or until the rice is just tender, but retains some bite and the seafood is cooked through. (The shells of the mussels will be open and the prawns will be pink.)Serve with a rocket salad and crusty bread.
