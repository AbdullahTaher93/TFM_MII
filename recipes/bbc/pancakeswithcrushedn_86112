For the pancakes, place the flour, baking powder, eggs and milk into a large bowl and whisk together to make a smooth batter. Add the sultanas and stir.Heat the vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan and pour in a ladleful of batter, swirling the pan so that the batter covers the base in a thin layer. Fry for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden-brown. Remove the pancake from the pan and set aside to keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.For the chocolate sauce, place the cream, chocolate and hazelnut spread, orange liqueur and satsuma zest in a small pan and heat gently, stirring frequently, until smooth and well combined.To serve, place the pancakes onto serving plates, drizzle over the sauce and sprinkle over the pistachio nuts.
