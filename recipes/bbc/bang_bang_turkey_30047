First marinade the turkey. Whisk the soy sauce, lime juice, sugar, chilli powder and five-spice together. Put the turkey in a dish, pour over the marinade and toss. Cover with cling film and leave to stand.For the peanut sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan and add the shallots. Cook on a medium heat until they are translucent and have taken on some colour, then add the garlic, ginger and chillies.Continue to cook, stirring regularly, for another 2â€“3 minutes, then add the remaining sauce ingredients. Stir, then simmer until the sauce has reduced down. Leave to cool.To assemble the salad, arrange all the vegetables over a large serving platter. Use a tablespoon or so of the sauce to coat the turkey, then place this on top. Drizzle over a little more of the sauce, then garnish with the chillies, herbs and peanuts.
