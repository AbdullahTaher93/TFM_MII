Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Cut a large pouch in each of the chicken breasts, using a small sharp knife.Divide 100g/3½oz of the Parmesan and the mozzarella into 4. Pile the Parmesan on top of the mozzarella and wrap each pile with the prosciutto pieces. Stuff each chicken breast with the prosciutto-wrapped cheese and press down the edges of the breast so the pouch is sealed (you can use a cocktail stick to help secure it).Sprinkle the flour onto a plate and season with salt and pepper. Beat the eggs in a bowl and sprinkle the breadcrumbs and remaining Parmesan on a separate plate. Dredge each cutlet in the flour, then dip into the eggs and coat in the cheese and breadcrumbs.Heat a frying pan until hot, add the olive oil and fry the chicken for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Transfer to a roasting tray and roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes until cooked through.Meanwhile for the salads, to make the dressing whisk the egg yolk, Dijon mustard, red wine vinegar and 250ml/9fl oz water together in a bowl until combined. Gradually whisk in 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil, whisking all the time, until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper. Place the red cabbage into a large bowl, then pour over 100ml/3½fl oz of the dressing and mix well.Place the kale in a large bowl. Heat a small frying pan and add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Once hot add the cumin seeds. Once they start to jump remove from the heat and pour over the raw kale.Put the chicken on serving plates and place the red cabbage and kale salads alongside.
