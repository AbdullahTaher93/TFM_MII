Put the rice, saffron, cinnamon and salt into a large saucepan with 1.5 litres/2½ pints of cold water. Place over a high heat, bring to the boil and cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally to stop the rice sticking to the base. Drain through a sieve and set aside.To make the sauce, put the same saucepan back on the hob and turn the heat up to high. Add the butter, then, as soon as the butter is hot, add the garlic and let it brown for about 4–5 minutes. Add the onions and salt and cook until the onions are soft – this can take 15 minutes.Squeeze in the juice of the half lemon, then cut the lemon rind into thin slices and add to the pan.Add the chillies, turmeric and five-spice, and stir for 5 minutes to cook the spices. Take off the heat and add the parsley and prawns. Stir well, so the prawns are coated. The prawns don’t need cooking in the sauce – they will steam and cook in the biryani. Otherwise they run the risk of becoming dry and rubbery.Take a large pan, something you would be happy to serve up in, and pour the oil into the base. Swirl it around so that some of the oil goes up the sides.Pop in half of the rice and spread it evenly across the bottom of the pan. Put all the prawn mixture on top of the rice.Put the rest of the rice on top of the prawns. Put the lid on firmly and place on a high heat for 5 minutes, then turn the heat down completely. Leave to cook for 20 minutes, then serve.
