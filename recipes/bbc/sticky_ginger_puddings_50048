Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease six 175ml/6fl oz metal mini pudding basins or dariole moulds and line the bases with circles of baking paper. Place the moulds on a baking tray.Put the dates in a heatproof bowl and pour over 150ml/5fl oz boiling water. Set aside to cool, then transfer to a food processor. Add the stem ginger, tamarind paste and treacle and blend to a purée.Put the flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, bicarbonate of soda, egg, butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the puréed dates and mix until well combined.Spoon the mixture into the prepared moulds. Bake for 20 minutes, or until well risen and firm to the touch.For the sauce, place all of the ingredients except the whisky into a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring constantly until smooth and glossy. (Watch out for splashes and don’t be tempted to touch or taste the sauce as it will be extremely hot.) Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the whisky.Carefully loosen the sides of each pudding using a table knife (the puddings will be hot, so wear oven gloves). Turn out onto warmed serving plates and remove the baking paper. Pour a little sauce over each one and put the remaining sauce in a jug. Decorate with chopped pistachios and serve immediately.
