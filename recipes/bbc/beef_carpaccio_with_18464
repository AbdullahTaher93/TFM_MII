Season both sides of the steak thoroughly with salt and pepper.  Heat a greased heavy-based frying pan until hot.  Put the steak in the pan (it should sizzle immediately) and cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side for rare-medium. Transfer to a chopping board and leave to rest. Once cooled, refrigerate for 1 hour.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the capers for a few minutes until crisp and puffed up. Remove to a bowl lined with kitchen paper.Whisk together the mustard, mayonnaise and olive oil until you have a loose sauce.  Remove the steak from the fridge and finely slice it into slivers, cutting against the grain.Arrange on a large plate or serving platter. Drizzle with the mustard mayo and lemon juice, and scatter over the parsley, Parmesan shards and capers.  Drizzle with olive oil and finish with the pine nuts and salt and pepper.
