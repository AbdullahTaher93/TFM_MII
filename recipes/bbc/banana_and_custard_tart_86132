Lightly grease a 20cm/8in loose-bottomed tart tinFor the pastry, place the flour, sugar, butter and vanilla seeds in a bowl and rub together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs (or pulse in a food processor).Lightly beat the whole egg and pour it into the flour mixture. Stir the mixture together until it forms clumps, then bring together with your hands to form a dough. Wrap in clingfilm and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.Roll the pastry out to a 3mm/⅛in thickness and use it to line the tart tin, leaving any excess pastry hanging over the edge. Chill in the fridge for 10 minutes.Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Preheat a large baking tray.Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper and fill with dried beans or rice.Put the tin onto the preheated baking sheet and bake for eight minutes.Remove the paper and beans and bake the pastry case for a further five minutes.Beat the remaining egg yolk in a bowl.Carefully trim off the overhanging pastry edge level with the top of the tin, then brush the inside of the case with the egg yolk.Put the pastry case back into the oven for a further five minutes, then remove it from the oven and set aside to cool.Reduce the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 3.For the filling, arrange the banana slices in the bottom of the pastry case.Beat the egg, eggs yolks, rum and sugar together in a bowl until well combined.Heat the cream in a saucepan until boiling, then whisk the cream into the egg mixture until well combined.Pour the custard into the pastry case and bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the custard is just set and the top is pale golden-brown.Meanwhile, for the spiced sautéed bananas, melt the butter in a frying pan and fry the bananas for 1-2 minutes, or until just golden-brown. Carefully pour in the rum and flambé the liquid by slowly tilting the pan towards the gas flame, or light it with a match. Let the flames flare up then die down. (Caution: keep your face and hair away from the flames. Do not leave unattended.)Add the sugar, ground cinnamon and ground allspice and fry for another minute.To serve, cut the tart into wedges, place onto serving plates and spoon some bananas and clotted cream alongside.
