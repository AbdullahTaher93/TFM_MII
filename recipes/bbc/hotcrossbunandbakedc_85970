For the custard, whisk the egg yolks, whole eggs and sugar together in a bowl.Place the milk, cream and the vanilla pod and seeds into a pan over a low heat and slowly bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and remove the vanilla pod.Pour the milk and cream onto the egg mixture and whisk well.Butter the hot cross buns, then cut into quarters.Place a layer of the hot cross buns into a 22cm/9in x 10cm/4in, 5cm/2in deep ovenproof dish.Sprinkle with some sultanas and raisins and the demerara sugar. Repeat the layers and finish with a final layer of buns.Pour the custard over the buns and leave to stand for 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.Place the dish into a deep roasting tray and add enough water to the tray to come a third of the way up the dish (this is a bain-marie). Cover with foil.Carefully place the pudding and bain-marie into the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the custard has set. Remove the foil for the final five minutes of cooking to brown the top.Serve the pudding with cream or mascarpone.
