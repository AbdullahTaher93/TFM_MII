For the pears, put the sugar, white wine, cinnamon and 350ml/12fl oz water in a saucepan large enough to accommodate the pears. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.In the meantime, stud each pear with 4 cloves, then carefully add them to the poaching liquid along with the lemon juice and zest. Simmer slowly for about 12–15 minutes, turning from time to time until the pears are just softened. Leave to cool completely before removing.To prepare the crumble, preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Using your fingertips, rub the butter, flour, sugar, vanilla and ginger together in the bowl and then stir in the almonds.Spread the crumble onto a baking tray and bake for about 12–15 minutes, turning twice during cooking. Once lightly browned, remove from the oven and leave to cool completely.For the cream, whip the cream, mascarpone, icing sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest and juice together until firm. Set aside.For the chocolate sauce, melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl placed over a saucepan of gently simmering water. Do not let the bowl touch the water – allow the chocolate to melt very gently. Remove from the heat and set aside.To assemble, core each pear from the base and slice 2cm/¾in pieces from the top of each pear (keep the stalks intact). Place the pear bases on a serving platter. Dip the tops into the chocolate sauce and leave to set on baking paper.Spoon or pipe the cream onto the top of pear bases and place the dipped pear stalk on top.Drizzle chocolate sauce around each pear and sprinkle the crumble over. Arrange dried cherries on top and place a mint leaf on each pear.
