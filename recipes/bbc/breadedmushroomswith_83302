Toss the mushrooms in the flour, coat them in egg, then coat in breadcrumbs.Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan. It is ready when a breadcrumb that is dropped in will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended!)Deep fry the mushrooms until golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.To make the dip, place all the ingredients into a food processor, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix until smooth.Serve the mushrooms on a plate with the dip in a small bowl.
