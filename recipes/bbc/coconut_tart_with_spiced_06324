For the spiced rum pineapple, put the sugar in an even layer in a heavy-bottomed pan. Warm on a medium heat, without stirring. When the sugar starts to melt at the edges, shake the pan, then continue to heat. Stir with a wooden spoon until all the sugar has melted and turned to caramel. Carefully add the rum, chilli, vanilla seeds and star anise.Put the pineapple in a bowl and pour over the caramel. Cover and set aside for at least an hour.For the coconut tart, preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to the thickness of a pound coin. Use it to line a 25cm/10in fluted, loose-bottomed tart tin. Prick the base with a fork. Line with baking paper and fill with baking beans.Bake for 15–20 minutes. Remove the beans and paper and bake for 5–10 minutes more, or until cooked through.
