For the courgette pancakes, beat the flour, eggs and half of the milk in a bowl to a fairly loose batter, adding more milk little by little as necessary.Stir in the grated courgette and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat the butter and olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Ladle some of the courgette batter into the frying pan and swirl the pan until the mixture is evenly distributed. Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown on both sides. Set aside on a warm covered plate. Repeat with the rest of the mixture.To serve, pile the pancakes onto a plate. Put the Greek-style yoghurt into a small serving bowl, sprinkle it with the paprika, and serve on one side.
