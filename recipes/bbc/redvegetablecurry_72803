To make the curry paste, dry-fry the peppercorns, cumin and coriander seeds until fragrant, then grind them in a mortar and pestle.Put them with all the other paste ingredients, except the oil, into a food processor and blend until smooth (it takes a good 5 minutes).Warm the oil in a pan and add 4 good spoonfuls of paste (1 per person). Cook on a low heat until it becomes fragrant. Turn up the heat to high, add the coconut milk and stock and bring to the boil. Simmer for 3 minutes.Add the sweet potatoes, pumpkin and spring onions and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the French beans and courgette and simmer for a further 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender.Meanwhile, chop some coriander and stir it through the rice. Garnish the curry with the chilli and a sprig of coriander and serve it with the rice.
