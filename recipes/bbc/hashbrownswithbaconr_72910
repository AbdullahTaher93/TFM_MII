Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise, season with salt and pepper, and arrange on a baking tray. Roll each of the bacon rashers into a tight roll and place on the same tray. Drizzle the bacon rolls with the honey and bake for 20 minutes or until the tomatoes are soft and the bacon is crisp.Peel the potatoes and onion, coarsely grate them, then wrap in a clean cloth and squeeze out excess liquid. Place in a bowl, add the beaten egg, flour, chopped herbs, one teaspoon sea salt and olive oil, and stir well.Heat one teaspoon vegetable oil in a frying pan until hot, and then add two heaped tablespoons of the potato mixture.Squash them flat and fry gently on both sides until golden. Keep them warm in the oven while you cook the remaining hash browns, adding a little extra oil to the pan each time.Serve the hash browns topped with the roasted tomato halves, crisp bacon rolls and rosemary.
