Cover and set aside in the fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes.At the end of the marinating time, remove the beef from the marinade (discard the marinade). Heat a wok until nearly smoking, then add the vegetable oil and beef. Stir fry for 1-2 minutes, or until just browned all over. Remove the beef from the wok and set aside.Add the peppers to the wok and stir fry for 1-2 minutes, then add the oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil and water. Cook for one minute, then return the beef to the wok and stir fry for a further minute.  Keep warm.For the egg fried rice, heat a clean wok until hot and add the oil. Add the cooked, cooled rice and stir fry for 2-3 minutes to heat through.Lightly mix the beaten eggs and sesame oil together, then pour over the rice. Continue to stir fry for 2-3 minutes, breaking up any large lumps of egg and rice with a wooden spoon, until the egg is set.  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir in the spring onions and coriander.To serve, spoon the black pepper beef onto serving plates and pile the egg fried rice alongside.
