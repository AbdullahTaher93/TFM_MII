Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line two large baking trays with baking paper.Tip the sweet potato wedges onto one of the trays and drizzle with the olive oil. Season well with black pepper and toss, then spread out in a single layer. Roast for 10 minutes while you prepare the chicken.Tip the flour, garlic granules and salt into a bowl and finely grate the lemon zest over the top, then mix well. Crack the eggs into a second bowl, add the smoked paprika and plenty of black pepper and beat together. Tip the puffed rice cereal into a third bowl, add the thyme and stir well, then scrunch the puffed rice in your hands to break it up slightly.Coat the chicken strips in the flour, ensuring they are completely coated, then dip them into the beaten egg mixture. (Do a few at a time, as you donâ€™t want to end up with sticky fingers.) Transfer them, a few at a time, to the puffed rice and toss until coated, then transfer to the second tray in a single layer. Repeat until all the chicken is coated.Stir the sweet potato wedges, then return to the oven with the tray of chicken strips and bake for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through and the wedges are tender.A few minutes before the chicken and wedges are ready, cook the green beans in a saucepan of boiling water for 3 minutes until just tender, then drain. Cut the lemon into five wedges.Serve the chicken goujons and potato wedges with the green beans and lemon wedges.
