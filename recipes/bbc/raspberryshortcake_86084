Beat the butter and sugar together well until pale. Add the orange zest and beat very well. Add the flour, ground almonds and breadcrumbs, and mix thoroughly into a soft dough.Place a large piece of baking parchment onto a work surface. Place the dough at one end of the paper, then roll it in the paper to make a sausage shape roughly 5cm/2in in diameter. Seal the sausage in the paper and chill overnight.Preheat the oven to 170C/340F/Gas 3.Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment. Cut the roll of shortcake dough into slices the thickness of a one-pound coin and lay them on the baking parchment. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden-brown. Leave the shortcake to cool and become crisp. Choose the 12 best shortcakes and store the rest for another time.When ready to serve, whip the cream to soft peaks. Apply a comma-shaped swirl of cream onto each of four plates (this helps stop the shortcake sliding around) and sit a shortcake on top. Spoon on a generous spoonful of cream and heap with a few raspberries, then sprinkle a little caster sugar over. Apply another small spoonful of cream and place another shortcake on it. Repeat with more cream, a few more raspberries and another little blob of cream, then place the last shortcake on top and add a dusting of icing sugar. Repeat this process to make four shortcake stacks. (If your raspberries aren't quite sweet enough, layer the shortcakes with a mix of half cream and half custard instead of all cream, adding a touch of vanilla extract and lemon juice to taste.)
