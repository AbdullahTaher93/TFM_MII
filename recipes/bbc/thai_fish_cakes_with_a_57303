For the fish cakes, place the fish in a food processor and blend for 3 seconds until smooth. Add the fish sauce, egg, coriander, curry paste, chilli, garlic, ginger, lime zest and juice and blend again until everything is combined.Remove the blade from the food processor and stir through the green beans and half the spring onions. With damp hands, form the mixture into 12 balls and flatten to make fish cakes. Coat each fish cake with the sesame seeds.Heat the oil in a large frying pan and fry the fishcakes in batches for about 2 minutes on each side. Remove with a fish slice and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.Meanwhile, for the dressing, whisk the caster sugar, lime zest and juice and fish sauce until the caster sugar has dissolved. Whisk in the red chilli.For the salad, toast the peanuts in a dry frying pan until golden-brown, remove from the pan and bash roughly in a pestle and mortar.Put all the rest of the salad ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Pour over the dressing and give it a good mix to combine.Garnish the fish cakes with the remaining spring onions and serve straight away with the salad and some sweet chilli dipping sauce.
