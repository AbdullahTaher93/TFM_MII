Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Boil the potatoes in unsalted water for about 20 minutes until tender. There's no need to add salt to the water as the smoked salmon will provide the required saltiness. Drain, leave to cool for a couple of minutes, allowing the steam to evaporate, and then mash with the cream cheese until smooth.Chop the smoked salmon and mix with the mashed potatoes, dill, lemon zest, horseradish and capers, if using, and season with salt and pepper. Shape into walnut-sized balls and flatten gently. Lightly coat each one with the breadcrumbs and place on an oiled baking sheet. Either cook straight away or refrigerate until needed.To cook, drizzle over a little olive oil and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, turning after 5 minutes or until golden.
