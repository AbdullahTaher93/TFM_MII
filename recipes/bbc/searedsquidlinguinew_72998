To prepare the squid, separate the head and tentacles from the body and discard the stiff cartilaginous quill. Cut the head free from the tentacles and discard. Remove the purplish skin. Clean and rinse the squid, then cut the large tentacles in half and the body into 1cm (½in) ringlets.To make the chilli oil, simply stir all the ingredients together. Heat very gently, set aside and keep warm.Cook the pasta in plenty of salted boiling water until al dente. Meanwhile, heat the light olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat.When the oil is almost smoking, add the squid and season with salt and pepper.Cook for 1½-2 minutes, until the squid turns white. Add the tomatoes and continue to cook for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and keep warm.To serve, toss the drained pasta in 2-3 tablespoons of the chilli oil. Divide the pasta between the warmed plates, then spoon over the squid and tomatoes. Drizzle with more chilli oil and serve.
