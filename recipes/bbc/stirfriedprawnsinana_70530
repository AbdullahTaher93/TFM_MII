As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop - this takes just a few seconds - put in the garlic and curry leaves.Stir until the garlic turns medium brown and put in the prawns.Stir until the prawns turn opaque most of the way through and put in the sauce.Turn the heat to medium and just heat the sauce through until it begins to simmer.  By then the prawns should be completely opaque and cooked through.Turn off the heat.
