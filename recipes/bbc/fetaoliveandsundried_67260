Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.Sift the flours and baking powder into a large, roomy bowl, tip in any bran leftin the sieve, then add the cayenne and mustard powder and, using a knife, work in the 2 tbsp of olive oil, plus the reserved tbsp of oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.When the mixture looks like lumpy breadcrumbs stir in the chopped thyme, cubed feta, olives and sun-dried tomatoes.Now in a separate bowl beat the egg with the 2 tbsp of milk and add half this mixture to the other ingredients. Using your hands, bring the mixture together to form a dough, adding more of the egg and milk as it needs it - what you should end up with is a dough that is soft but not sticky.Now on a floured board, roll the dough out to a depth of 2.5cm/1in. Then stamp out the scones using a 5cm/2in cutter, either plain or fluted. Put the cut-out pieces on a baking tray and brush them with the milk.Finally top each scone with the crumbled feta, and put the tray on the highest shelf of the oven to bake for 12-15 minutes or until they've turned a golden colour. Then remove them to a wire rack until they are cool enough to eat.
