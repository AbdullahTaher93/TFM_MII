Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.Add the parsley and basil and stir well, then pour the sauce into a bowl.Sprinkle with the cheddar cheese.For the deep-fried courgettes, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Dip the courgettes first in the milk and then dredge in the flour. Repeat this process with the milk and flour, then carefully place the courgettes into the hot oil and fry for three minutes, or until golden. Carefully remove the courgettes with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.To serve, place the courgettes onto a warm plate, sprinkle with salt and serve the tomato sauce alongside.
