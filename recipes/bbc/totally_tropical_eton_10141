Gently whip the cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form.Fold the yoghurt through the cream, being careful not to over-mix.Break the meringues into the bowl and gently stir to combine. (It should be quite a stiff mixture).Spoon a layer of the meringue mixture into the bases of four serving glasses. Sprinkle over a handful of mango pieces and drizzle with the passion fruit seeds. Repeat until all the meringue mixture and fruit is used up.Decorate with mint sprigs, if using, and eat immediately.
