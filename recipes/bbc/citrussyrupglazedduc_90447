For the duck, trim the edges of the fat and score the skin with the tip of a sharp knife. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a frying pan until smoking then add the duck, skin-side down, and fry for 3-4 minutes to render some of the fat. Turn the duck over.In a bowl, mix together the remaining duck ingredients and pour over the duck. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the liquid is thick and glossy.For the rice, place the rice into a pan with the stock, green beans and red pepper. Bring to the boil and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Drain, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and pack into a small greased glass bowl, then turn out onto a serving plate.Slice the duck, arrange next to the rice and drizzle over the juices from the pan. Garnish with fresh coriander and orange to serve.
