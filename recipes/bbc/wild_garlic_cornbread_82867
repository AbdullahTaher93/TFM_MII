Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Grease a 23cm/9in square baking tin with the lard.Put the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl and add ½ teaspoon of salt. Mix thoroughly to combine. Lightly mix the eggs into the buttermilk. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the buttermilk mixture and half of the garlic. Add the cheese and beat together to create a smooth batter.Scrape the batter into the tin and smooth the top with a palette knife. Bake for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the remaining garlic with the butter and ½ teaspoon of salt. Spread some of this over the cornbread and return to the oven for 5 minutes. The cornbread is done when it is well risen and golden brown with a crust on top.Spread more of the garlic butter over the cornbread when it comes out of the oven and serve the rest in a small bowl alongside.
