Start by making the dressing at the bottom of a large serving bowl (saves on washing-up if nothing else). Add the oil, lemon juice, honey, garlic, za'atar and tahini and mix together.Add the onion and mix through really well. The onion will soften as it sits in the vinegar. Tip in the kiwi.To prepare the cucumber, slice lengthways and remove the seeds using a teaspoon. Cut into long strips and cube. Add to the bowl. Add the feta on top and sprinkle over the chopped dill and sesame seeds.Donâ€™t mix the salad till you are ready to serve, or everything will wilt and go weird!
