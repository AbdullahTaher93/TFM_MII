Heat 10 sprays of olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Add the onion and fry for 4–5 minutes, or until softened, adding a splash of water if it starts to stick. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the cavolo nero and cook for 2–3 minutes until soft. Stir through the spinach and chard, then take off the heat; the spinach will have wilted only a little. Season with salt and pepper. Leave to cool completely.Meanwhile, for the sauce, put the sugar in a small saucepan over a medium-high heat and swirl gently until melted and starting to turn to a caramel. Take off the heat and immediately add the vinegar, stirring to make a syrup. Add the tomatoes, chilli flakes and a pinch of salt. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until thickened.Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Mix the feta, pine nuts, dill, nutmeg and lemon zest into the cold greens. Divide into six portions. Unroll the filo; keep under a damp tea towel to stop the sheets drying out.Lay a sheet of filo on your work surface with a short edge facing you and brush the edges with a little oil. Place a portion of filling at the lower end, about 15mm/⅝in from the bottom and left hand edges and form into a triangular shape. Fold over the right half of the pastry sheet, then fold the bottom left filo corner over the filling to make a triangle. Fold the parcel up to form another triangle. Keep folding over and up until you reach the top. Seal the edge with a little oil. Spray with a little oil, sprinkle with sesame seeds and place on a baking tray. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until golden and crispy.Serve with the warm tomato chilli sauce.
