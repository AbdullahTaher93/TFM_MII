For the marinade, mix together the yoghurt, vinegar, ginger, garlic, spices and salt in a bowl, add the chicken, coat and leave to marinade, covered, in the fridge for 1 - 3 hours.For the flour coating, mix together the flours and seasoning. Toss the chicken thighs in the flour mixture, one at a time, and place on a plate.Add the oil to a large frying pan or wok and heat on a medium heat. Add the chilli, garlic and curry leaves and cook for 3 - 5 minutes, until the leaves start to crisp and the garlic goes golden-brown. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. This will really flavour the oil.Lay the chicken in the oil and cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes on each side, until cooked through and are golden-brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle over the chilli, garlic and curry leaves and serve with lemon wedges and a massive green salad. I make one with Little Gems, spring onions and mint.
