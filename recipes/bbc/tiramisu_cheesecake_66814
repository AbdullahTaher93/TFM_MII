To make the base, blend the biscuits in a food processor and mix with the melted butter. Press into the bottom of the tin and leave to set in the fridge for at least an hour.Combine the beaten egg yolks and sugar in a bowl sat over simmering water. Make sure the base of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Stir constantly until the mixture thickens and becomes a light lemony colour. Allow to cool before adding the mascarpone and beat until fully combined.Whisk the cream to soft peaks then fold gently into the mascarpone mixture.Mix the espresso, coffee liqueur and rum together and pour over the sponge fingers.Arrange one layer of sponge on top of the set biscuit base, then cover with the mascarpone mixture. Repeat with another layer of sponge and a final layer of mascarpone. Smooth the top with a flat knife and place in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight.Meanwhile, to make the truffles, gently heat the cream and salt in a pan over a low–medium heat. Add the chocolate, rum and butter and continue to warm through, stirring until smooth. Allow to cool, then leave in the fridge for 2 hours.Using a teaspoon, take out scoops of the truffle mix and roll into little balls. Roll the balls in cocoa powder and transfer to a plate in the fridge, until the cheesecake is set.When ready to serve, dust the top of the cheesecake with the cocoa powder and release from the tin. Decorate with the chocolate truffles and serve in slices.
