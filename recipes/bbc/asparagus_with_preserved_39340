Put the asparagus into a shallow bowl and pour over just enough boiling water to cover them.  Set aside for 5 minutes. Drain the hot water and place the bowl under running cold water to cool the asparagus.  Once cooled, dry the excess moisture from the spears using kitchen paper.Halve the asparagus spears lengthways and place them in a bowl.  Add the preserved lemons, pickled chillies, fresh mint and a generous amount of black pepper, then drizzle with some olive oil.  Mix well and serve.
