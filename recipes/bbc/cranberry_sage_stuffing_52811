Melt the butter in a shallow medium-sized pan set over a medium heat. Add the sliced onions with the thyme, rosemary, garlic and bay leaf. Stir well and season with salt and pepper.Continue to cook gently until the onions are beautifully soft but not coloured. Once soft, add the sourdough breadcrumbs bit by bit until the mixture starts to form a stuffing texture. Add the cranberries, sage and the freshly chopped parsley.Season with a little lemon juice and the lemon zest. Season with more salt and pepper if needed. Serve in a bowl.
