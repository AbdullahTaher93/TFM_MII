For the compôte, place the berries, spices, orange peel and sugar in a saucepan and heat until the sugar dissolves. Simmer on low for about 3–4 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool (This can be prepared the day before and kept refrigerated.)For the bircher muesli, soak the oats and dried fruits in the milk for at least 4 hours or better still overnight in the fridge.To finish, slice the vanilla pod in half and scrape out the seeds and add them to the oat mixture. Grate the apples into the mixture and add the lemon juice, to taste.To complete the bircher muesli, add most of the natural yoghurt and honey to taste (holding back some to serve on top).Serve in pretty glasses and spoon over the compôte, a spoon of yoghurt, a drizzle of honey and the chopped nuts.
