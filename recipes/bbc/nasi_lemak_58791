Put the coconut milk, ginger, lemongrass, rice and a pinch of salt in a large saucepan. Add 400ml/14fl oz water, stir and cook over a medium heat for 10–15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and all the liquid has been absorbed.To make the sambal, heat the oil in a frying pan and sweat the onion and garlic for 5–7 minutes, until soft. Add the shrimp paste, chilli paste and most of the soaked anchovies and stir. Add the sugar and a pinch of salt and pour in the tamarind water. Simmer until it reduces to a thick paste. Set aside.Meanwhile, to prepare the garnish, boil the eggs in water for 7–10 minutes; the yolks should be firm. When they are cool enough to handle, peel off the shells and cut the eggs in half. Preheat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Deep-fry the dried white anchovies for 3 minutes, or until crispy. Toast the peanuts in a dry frying pan.Pick the lemongrass out of the rice and discard. Put the rice in a small bowl and press down until it is compacted. Upturn the rice in the middle of the pandan leaf. Arrange the egg, peanuts, cucumber and remaining anchovies around the rice and scatter over the crispy anchovies.
