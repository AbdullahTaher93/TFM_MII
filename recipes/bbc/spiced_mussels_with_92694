Preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Peel and cut the potatoes into skinny fries and cook in batches for 3–5 minutes or until golden and crispy. Drain on kitchen paper and season with salt.Discard any mussels with broken shells and any that refuse to close when tapped.  Place a large pot over a medium heat and brown the chorizo until just golden and sizzling.Add a knob of butter, allow it to melt and sizzle before adding the shallot, garlic and chilli flakes. Cook gently for 2–3 mins until the shallot is tender.Pour in the cider, bring to a boil, then add the mussels. Cover with a lid and allow them to steam for about 4 minutes, shaking the pot from time to time, until the mussels are fully open. Discard any mussels that remain closed.Remove from the heat and stir in the cream and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.Serve the mussels in a large bowl with the fries alongside.
