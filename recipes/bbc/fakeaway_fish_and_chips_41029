Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Line two large baking trays with baking paper.Crack the eggs into a shallow bowl, whisk well and season with half the salt and plenty of black pepper. Add the fish and swirl around until coated in the egg.Tip the cornflakes into a large food bag, then seal and bash with a rolling pin until crushed.Open the bag and add the frozen fish pieces one at a time to the crushed cornflakes, turning it around to fully coat.  Lift out and put onto one of the prepared baking trays.Put the chips onto the other prepared baking tray and drizzle with the oil, remaining salt and plenty of black pepper. Toss to combine then shuffle the tray around until the chips are in a single layer - you might need to use two trays.Put the trays in the oven and bake for 15 minutes,. Remove the chip tray and turn the chips over. Return to the oven for another 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the potatoes tender and golden brown.Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the peas and cook for 2-3 minutes, until heated through. Drain and tip back into the saucepan, add the crème fraîche and crush with a masher until quite broken down. Stir in the chives.Serve the fish and chips with a small portion of peas alongside.
