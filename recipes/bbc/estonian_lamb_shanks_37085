Add the juniper berries, lemon and orange zests, bay leaves and 2 large sprigs of parsley. Stir for a minute or two, then add the lamb shanks, on their sides if possible. Add the potatoes and carrots.De-glaze the frying pan used to brown the lamb with a little stock and add to the casserole dish, then pour in the remaining stock and bring to the boil. Add the orange juice and season with salt and pepper. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for an hour and half, then remove the lid and cook for a further 30 minutes.Return the casserole to the hob and remove the lamb shanks, parsley sprigs and bay leaves.
