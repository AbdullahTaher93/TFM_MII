Preheat the oven to 180C/360F/Gas 4.Grease and line a 30cm/12in cake tin with baking parchment.For the cake, beat the flour, baking powder, butter, sugar, eggs, coconut and lime juice together in a bowl (or use an electric mixer).Carefully fold in the raspberries.Pour the cake batter into the cake tin, then bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until risen and golden-brown. Test the cake with a metal skewer - if the skewer comes out clean, the cake is cooked through.Remove the cake from the oven and immediately spread the jam over the top.Allow the cake to cool then and sprinkle with the desiccated coconut and place the extra raspberries on top.To serve, cut the cake into squares.
