To make the rice puffs, cover the rice with water and leave to soak for an hour.Rinse and drain the rice thoroughly, add the salt and stir to coat the grains evenly. In a large frying pan, dry-fry the rice over a low heat for about 10 minutes, or until just lightly toasted – try not to let the rice grains colour at all. Set aside to cool completely.Line a baking tray with kitchen paper. Heat the oil to 180C in a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep saucepan. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Put small batches of the toasted and cooled rice into the base of a metal sieve then carefully lower into the hot oil and fry for about 10 seconds until they bubble and puff up. Transfer the rice puffs to the baking tray to drain any excess oil. Repeat with the remaining rice.Once you’ve cooked all the rice, mix all of the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl. Toss through the puffed rice, taking care not to over-handle. Serve immediately.
