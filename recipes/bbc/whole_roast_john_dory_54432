Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Line a large roasting tin with foil, leaving plenty of overlap so you can create a tent around the fish and shellfish. Drizzle the foil with olive oil and add a few small knobs of butter and scatter with half of the lemon zest and garlic. Season the fish inside and out. Place a small amount of the remaining lemon zest, garlic and a bay leaf inside the fish. Place the fish on top of the seasoned foil, cover with the remaining lemon zest, garlic and bay leaves and pour over the white wine or vermouth, then drizzle with a little more olive oil.Bring the foil together over the fish and fold over the edges to seal and make an airtight tent. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes.Discard any open mussels that do not close when given a sharp tap. Remove the fish from the oven, open the foil and add the mussels and langoustine. Dot with more butter, then reseal the foil and return to the oven for 5-10 minutes, until the fish is cooked through and the mussels have opened. Discard any mussels that havenâ€™t opened. Serve with the buttery juices spooned over.
