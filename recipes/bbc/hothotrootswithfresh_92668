Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender, adding extra stock if the mixture becomes too dry. (The sauce should be thick enough to just coat the vegetables.)Add the beans and spinach, cook for a further three minutes, or until the beans are just tender, then stir in the cream. Add half the lime juice and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more lime juice, to taste, as necessaryMeanwhile, for the mango and coconut relish, transfer the soaked coconut to a food processor (squeeze the coconut to remove any excess water).

Sprinkle the mint over the top of the relish.
