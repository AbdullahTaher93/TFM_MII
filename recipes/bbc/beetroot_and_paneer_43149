To make the burgers, add the beetroot, ginger and chilli to a dry pan over a medium heat. Fry until most of the excess liquid has evaporated, then drain in a sieve and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Leave to cool for 5 minutes.Add the remaining ingredients, except for the oil, and mix well. Set aside to cool.Once cool enough to handle, shape the mixture into 8 small patties. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan and cook for 5 minutes on each side, until a nice crust has formed.Serve the burgers in the buns, with the riata and chutney, if using.
