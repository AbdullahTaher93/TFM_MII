For the pasta, place the flour, eggs and olive oil into a food processor and pulse until combined.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth. Cut the dough in half and set one piece aside.Roll out one half of the dough until 1cm/½in thick, then feed it through a pasta machine. Start on the thickest setting, passing the sheet through several times and lowering the setting until it reaches the thinnest setting. Slice the pasta sheet into ribbons 1cm/½in wide. Repeat the process with the rest of the dough.Place the pasta into a large saucepan of boiling salted water and cook for 2-3 minutes, until al dente. Drain well, place into a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil.For the rocket pesto, place all the pesto ingredients into a small food processor and blend until smooth.To serve, pour the pesto over the pasta and stir well to coat. Place the pasta into two serving bowls.
