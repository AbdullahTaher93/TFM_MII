Pierce the skin several times with a sharp knife and place directly onto the top shelf of the oven and bake for 1 hour.Meanwhile, heat the remaining olive oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat and fry the onion and garlic for 2 minutes. Add the cumin and chilli flakes and fry for a further 2 minutes until soft and fragrant. Add the black beans and stock and simmer gently for 20â€“30 minutes or until the liquid has evaporated and the beans are soft and starting to disintegrate. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.For the purple slaw, mix the cabbage, radishes, onion, coriander and lime juice in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.Check the potato is cooked through by piercing with a blunt knife. When it is done, turn the oven off and leave the potato in for 15 minutes while you reheat the beans.To serve, break the potato open and fluff up the flesh with a fork. Spoon over a generous helping of beans and top with the cheese. Serve with the slaw on the side.
