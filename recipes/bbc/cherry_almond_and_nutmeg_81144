Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line two large baking trays with baking paper.Dust a work surface with icing sugar and roll out the pastry to a 30x35cm/12x14in rectangle. Place the pastry on one of the prepared baking trays and cut right down the middle lengthways, giving you two long equal rectangles. Now make three cuts widthways to give you eight equal rectangles. Place in the fridge.Put the jam in a bowl, add the nutmeg and mix. Add 1 teaspoon of jam to one side of each pastry piece, avoiding the edges. Brush the edges with the beaten egg and fold over the other half of the pastry. Press down the edges with a blunt knife to seal. This is crucial unless you enjoy flowing molten lava jam!Do the same with the remaining seven pastries and place on the other prepared baking tray. Brush the tops with the egg and place in the fridge for 20 minutes.Bake the pastries on the middle shelf of the oven for 20–25 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool.For the almond icing, put the icing sugar, 1½ tablespoons of water and the almond extract in a bowl and mix to a smooth paste. Cover the tops of the cooled pastries with the icing and sprinkle with the almonds.
