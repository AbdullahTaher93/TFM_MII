Trim the chicken pieces neatly and combine with the rest of the marinade ingredients in a roomy bowl. Cover loosely and leave in a cool place for a few hours, overnight if possible.Preheat the grill or barbecue. It should be moderately hot. Shake the excess moisture off the chicken joints and grill until the juices run clear, test through the thickest part with a skewer. Meanwhile combine the ingredients for the dipping sauce, and leave to infuse.Serve the grilled chicken with the dipping sauce on the side.
