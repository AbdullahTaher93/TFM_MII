Put the milk and yeast in a small bowl and whisk together.Whisk the sugar and eggs together in a separate bowl until well incorporated and light. Stir in melted butter, Marsala wine and vanilla extract.Place the flour and salt into the bowl of a free-standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.Add the yeast and milk mixture, along with the whisked egg mixture, and knead for 10 minutes on a very low speed.Cover and leave to rise in a warm, draught-free place until it more than doubles in size, which will take about 2 hours.Meanwhile, soak the raisins in the orange juice or brandy.Grease a 18cm/7in deep cake tin. Line the base with baking paper and make a 10cm/4in collar with double thickness baking paper to line the sides of the tin.Tip the dough out on a floured surface, mix in the soaked raisins and candied peel and lightly knead for 3â€“4 minutes. The dough will be soft and sticky, so oil your hands well to handle it.Roll the dough into a ball and place into the prepared tin. Cover and leave it to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until doubled in size again.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Brush the top of the panettone with the beaten egg and sprinkle over the almonds.Bake for about 55 minutes, or until well risen and golden-brown. Transfer to a cooling rack. Dust with icing sugar before serving.
