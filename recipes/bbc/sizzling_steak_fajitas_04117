Add the cumin, coriander and paprika. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 30 seconds, then stir in the beans, cherry tomatoes and cooked beef. Cook for 2–3 minutes, or until the beans and beef are hot.Stir in the chilli and season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few seconds more. Remove from the heat, scatter over the coriander and add a squeeze of lime. Toss lightly.Divide the tortillas between four warmed plates. Top with shredded lettuce then pile the beef mixture on top. Spoon the yoghurt over each tortilla and garnish with the coriander. Serve immediately, with extra lime wedges for squeezing.
