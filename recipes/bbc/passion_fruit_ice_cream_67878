Line your loaf tin with cling film, leaving plenty of overhang on the sides of the tin so that you can cover the top later.To make the ice cream cake, whip the double cream until ripples start to appear in the bowl and it’s slightly thickened but not stiff. Add the pulp, seeds and juice of the passion fruit, then the liqueur and fold briefly just to combine.Break up the meringue nests, making a mixture of both dust and small pieces of meringue, and very gently fold in, until evenly mixed.Spoon gently into the lined loaf tin, pressing down as you go so that you don’t have any air pockets. Once the mixture is carefully packed in and the top smoothed, cover with the cling film overhang, then wrap the tin in another sheet of cling film and put in the freezer overnight.To make the sauce, gently melt the butter, sugars and golden syrup in a deep, heavy- based saucepan about 20cm/8in in diameter. Once melted, turn the heat up a little and let it simmer for 3 minutes. Lift the pan up off the heat every now and again and give it a swirl.Add the coconut cream when the pan is off the heat and swirl again, then put back on the heat and cook at a fast simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring every now and then, until it’s the colour of peanut butter and slightly thickened (it will thicken more once cooled).Pour the sauce into a heatproof jug and leave to cool to room temperature. The sauce will thicken too much if refrigerated.When you are ready to serve, take the tin out of the freezer, remove the outer layer of cling film then lift out the ice cream cake and sit it on a board before fully unwrapping. Cut into thick slices; if you don’t want to eat all the cake at one sitting, wrap the remaining unsliced loaf up and put it back in the freezer.Put a slice onto each plate and leave to soften for 5–10 minutes, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. Zigzag some of the coconut-caramel sauce over each slice – stirring it briskly first if it’s got too thick – and pour the rest into a serving jug to take to the table alongside.
