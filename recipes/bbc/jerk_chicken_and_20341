Put the jerk paste ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth, using enough oil and orange juice to create a thick paste. Smother the chicken in the paste, cover and leave in the fridge for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.To make the flatbreads, beat the butter and milk together in a bowl. Slowly mix in the flour and ½ teaspoon salt until you have a dough consistency.Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface until smooth. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, place an ovenproof griddle pan over a high heat and cook the chicken on both sides until browned. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 40 minutes.  (You could also cook this on a hot barbecue. Just make sure the chicken is fully cooked before serving.)Place the rested dough on a lightly floured work surface and divide into quarters. Roll each quarter out to 3mm thick.Using a heavy-based frying pan or skillet, heat a little oil over a medium heat and add a flatbread. Cook for 1–2 minutes on each sides, or until you reach your desired level of crispness. Serve the chicken with the warm flatbreads.
