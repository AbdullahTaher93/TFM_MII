Grease 2 x 20cm/8in sandwich cake tins and line the base of each with a disc of greased baking parchment.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Cream together the dairy-free margarine and caster sugar in a mixing bowl for about 2 minutes until pale and light.Sift the dry ingredients into the bowl and mix to lightly combine. Add the vanilla extract, soya milk, vinegar and yoghurt and mix until smooth and thoroughly incorporated.Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins and spread level with the back of a spoon. Bake on the middle shelf of the preheated oven for about 25 minutes, or until risen, golden brown and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean.Leave the cakes to cool in the tins for 2â€“3 minutes and then carefully turn out onto a wire rack and leave until cold.For the filling, beat together the dairy-free margarine and icing sugar until smooth and light. Lay one of the cakes on a serving plate and spread the filling on top using a palette knife. Carefully spread the jam over the top and cover with the second cake layer. Dust with icing sugar to serve.
