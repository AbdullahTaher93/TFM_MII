Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.Place the eggs, flour, milk, water and seasoning in a large mixer and whisk until you have a smooth batter. Place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.Put the lard in two large roasting tins and place in the oven for 5-8 minutes or until it is smoking.Carefully pour in the batter - it will sizzle softly in the hot fat - then arrange the sausages in the batter.Transfer the tins back to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until puffed and golden-brown.
