For the dips, place the soy sauce, sesame oil and one of the chopped red chillies into a clean bowl and whisk together.Meanwhile, place the rice vinegar, sugar and the remaining one chopped red chilli into a pan and heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then pour into a clean bowl.For the prawn dim sum, place the prawns into a small food processor and blend to a pur√©e. Transfer to a bowl, add all the other ingredients, except the dim sum wrappers, and mix thoroughly.Place the wrappers onto a clean work surface and place a small spoonful of prawn mixture in the centre of each wrapper. Fold the wrappers over the prawn mixture to create a semi-circle. Press the edges of the wrapper together with damp fingers to seal the wrapper parcels and crimp the edges.Place the parcels into a bamboo steamer over a pan of simmering water and cover. Steam for 4-5 minutes, or until the prawn mixture is completely cooked through. Remove from the steamer and serve immediately.To serve, place the dim sum onto a serving plate with both bowls of dips alongside.
