Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Melt half of the butter in a 19cm/7½in ovenproof frying pan. Add the beetroot, sugar, vinegar and thyme leaves and cook for 12 minutes, stirring. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully cover with kitchen foil.Bake for 1 hour, or until the beetroot are just tender. Remove the foil, dot with the remaining butter and leave to cool for at least 10 minutes – don’t forget that the pan handle will be extremely hot, so take care to only move with an oven cloth.Increase the oven temperature to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.Unroll the pastry sheet and place a 24cm/9½in dinner plate gently on top. Cut around the plate to give a 24cm/9½in pastry disc. Place the pastry on top of the softened beetroot in the pan and tuck the sides down with a round-bladed knife. Prick lightly with a fork.Bake the tart for about 25 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed up and golden-brown. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then place a serving plate or board on top of the pan and very carefully invert so that the tarte drops gently down – take care as the pan and handle will remain hot.Dot with small pieces of goats’ cheese and tiny mint leaves. Serve with a lightly dressed salad.
