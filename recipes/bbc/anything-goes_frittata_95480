Heat the oil in a medium non-stick frying pan (ideally ovenproof) and gently fry the sweet potato, new potatoes, broccoli, pepper and leek for 5–7 minutes, or until the potatoes are lightly browned and the other vegetables are just tender, stirring regularly. Stir in the peas, chilli and feta.Break the eggs into a bowl and add a good pinch of salt and lots of black pepper. Beat well using a large metal whisk. Pour the eggs into the pan and give it a little shake, so they run down between all the vegetables.Cook the frittata  over a gentle heat for 5 minutes without stirring, or until the egg is almost set. Meanwhile, preheat the grill to high. Place the frittata under the hot grill for 3–4 minutes, or until set.Loosen the sides of the frittata and slide onto a board. Cut into wedges and serve with a green leafy salad.
