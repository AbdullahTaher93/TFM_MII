Fry for 2-3 minutes until golden and completely cooked through. Carefully remove the cooked balls with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.For the syrup, place the water, sugar and lemon juice into a pan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1-2 minutes.Carefully place the jamun balls into the syrup and roll around to completely coat.
