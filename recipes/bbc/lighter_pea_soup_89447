Heat the oil in a small saucepan over a medium–low heat. Add the onion and cook for 3–4 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic, peas and stock, bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for 20 minutes.Use a stick blender or food processor to blend the soup and season with black pepper. Serve garnished with the chives, if using.
