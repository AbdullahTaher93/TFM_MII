Place a large pan over a medium heat and put the hay in the bottom. Add the vegetable oil, rosemary and garlic. Top with the lamb chops and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Seal the pan tightly with aluminium foil and a lid (to prevent the smoke from escaping). Cook for 10-15 minutes, turning the lamb half way through. When cooked, add the butter to glaze the chops.For the salad, drain the bulgur wheat then just cover in boiling water and set aside for 10 minutes until all the liquid has been absorbed. Add the harissa paste and stir well. Stir through all the remaining ingredients and serve with the lamb chops.
