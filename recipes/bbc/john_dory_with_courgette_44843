For the zucchini shoestring fries, add the oil to a deep-fat fryer and heat to 190C (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not over-fill the pan or leave unattended).Meanwhile, slice the courgettes lengthways using a mandoline to create 4mm thick strips.Carefully dredge the courgette strings in the milk and shake around in the seasoned flour to lightly coat.Lower the cougette fries into the deep-fat fryer and cook for 3 minutes or until light golden-brown. Remove using a slotted spoon and leave to drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with fine salt and keep warm until ready to serve.Meanwhile for the John Dory, drizzle a generous glug of olive oil into a large shallow pan with a lid. Carefully add the John Dory fillets skin-side down with the garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper. Scatter the chopped herbs over the fish and place the pan over a medium heat. When the pan starts to sizzle, add the stock, lemon juice and orange juice and cover with a lid. After no more than 4 minutes, remove the fillets and place on warm plates.Turn the heat up to high, add the peppercorns and boil the juices until the volume of liquid starts to reduce (about 2 minutes). Take off the heat and pour the reduced juices onto the John Dory fillets. Garnish each fillet with a slice of orange, if using, and serve with the courgette fries alongside.To serve, put the John Dory onto a serving plate and the fries on the side.
