Preheat the oven to 210C/425F/Gas 7.On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to 3-4mm/⅛in thick. Cut out four 12cm/4½in circles using a pastry cutter and transfer to a baking tray.Score a circle in the centre of the pastry with a knife (leaving a 1cm/½in border) then brush with egg wash.Roll the marzipan out to 5mm/¼in thick and cut into four 11cm/4¼in circles and place in the centre of the pastry. Carefully place the apples in an overlapping ring over the marzipan to cover it all.Place the butter and honey in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring to combine. Brush most of it over the top of the apples.Place in the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the pastry is risen and golden-brown.Brush with any remaining melted butter and honey to glaze.For the spiced caramel sauce, place the sugar and spices in a frying pan and cook until the sugar is melted and golden-brown. Whisk in the double cream and bring to a simmer.Cook for 3-5 minutes, or until just thickened, then pass through a fine sieve into a clean pan.To serve, place the tarts in the centre of serving plates and spoon the sauce around the edge. Finish with a spoonful of ice cream on top.
