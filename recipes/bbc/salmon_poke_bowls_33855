Put the rice in a saucepan and wash until the water runs clear. Add just enough water to come 1cm/½in above the rice. Stirring all the time, place on a high heat (stirring will ensure that the rice doesn’t settle on the base). Once it comes to the boil, leave it to simmer on a medium heat until all the water has evaporated. Pop the lid on and leave on the lowest setting to steam (about 10 minutes).Meanwhile gather together everything you need to finish off the bowl.Make the sauce by mixing together the mayonnaise, soy sauce, sesame oil, fish sauce, Sriracha, lemon juice and black pepper. Put the salmon into a bowl, then pour over the sauce and mix well.Once the rice has steamed, mix the vinegar, salt and sugar in a small bowl, then pour over the rice and stir through.Divide the rice between two bowls and start adding all the different finishing ingredients. The salmon first, then the avocado, pickled red cabbage, carrot and peanuts. Sprinkle with the spring onions, sesame and nori, add a sprinkling of black pepper, and serve.
