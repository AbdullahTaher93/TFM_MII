Return the shanks to the saucepan and season well with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then turn down and cover.Cook for around two hours, or until the shanks are tender. Remove the shanks from the casserole and skim off the excess fat.

Stir through the lemon juice and taste for seasoning. Add salt and pepper, to taste.Serve the tagine garnished with parsley and mint leaves.
