For the tandoori quail, dry fry all the spices, apart from the saffron, in a pan until fragrant. Grind the spices in a pestle and mortar.Finely grate the garlic and ginger and add it to the yoghurt, along with the spices, lemon juice and saffron.Score the quail legs and breast lightly. Place the quail in a shallow bowl covered in the marinade and leave overnight.For the raita, season the cucumber with salt and pepper and leave for 30 minutes to an hour to allow the salt to draw any excess water out.Pat the cucumber dry on paper towels and add the rest of the ingredients: set to one side until required.Preheat the oven to 250C/Gas 9, or the highest setting possible. Put the quail directly on the hot oven shelf with a tray underneath to catch any drips! Bake for 12â€“15 minutes, or until cooked.Rest the quail for five minutes and serve with the raita.
