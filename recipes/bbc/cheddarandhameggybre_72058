Whisk to combine.With a sharp, thin-bladed knife, carefully slit open one side of each slice of bread to form a pocket. Ensure that you leave 1cm/0.5in around the edges.Spread the mustard on one side of the pocket and place a slice of ham and cheese inside.Put the pockets into a shallow dish. Pour over the egg mixture and leave for five minutes, turning once.Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat, add half of the olive oil and swirl to coat the base of the pan.Put the bread pocket into the pan and cook on one side for about two minutes until golden brown. Turn and cook for another minute.Remove from the pan and place on a baking tray. Put in the oven and cook for ten minutes, or until the filling has melted.
