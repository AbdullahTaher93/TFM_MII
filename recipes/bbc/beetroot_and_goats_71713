Boil the purple and golden beetroots in two separate saucepans for 1½–2 hours, or until tender. Set aside to cool completely, then remove the skins and slice thinly. Drain on kitchen paper for a few minutes and pat the slices dry with more kitchen paper.Line a 450g/1lb loaf tin with cling film, leaving plenty hanging over the edges. Beat the goats’ cheese lightly together with the chives, parsley and oregano.Layer slices of beetroot with the cheese mixture until all the ingredients are used (finish with a layer of beetroot). Bring the overhanging cling film up to enclose the filling and press down lightly. Place a couple of unopened cans on the top of the terrine to add extra weight and chill for at least 8 hours before serving.Turn the terrine out onto a board and remove the cling film. Use a very sharp knife to cut into slices. Serve as a starter with a green salad and slices of crusty bread.
