Transfer to a bowl and set aside.To marinade the chicken, put the chicken pieces in a large bowl. Add three-quarters of the garlic and ginger paste and reserve the rest for later. Add the turmeric, chilli powder, garam masala, salt, black salt, cardamom powder and dried fenugreek leaves and mix together well to coat the chicken. Add the lemon juice and stir then set aside to marinate for about 30 minutes.For the yoghurt mixture, put the yoghurt in a clean muslin and hang over a bowl for 30 minutes, allowing the water to drain out. Place the strained yoghurt in a large bowl. Add the remaining garlic and ginger paste, ground cardamom, salt, black salt, turmeric, chilli powder and garam masala. Using a whisk or spoon, blend together and drizzle in a little oil to combine.
