Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until crisp and slightly browned. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the spaghetti and cook for 8–10 minutes, until firm but slightly chewy (al dente).While the spaghetti is cooking, beat together the eggs and Parmesan with a fork. If it's a little thick, add some milk. Season well with salt and pepper.Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain over a bowl, reserving some of the cooking water.Place the frying pan with the pancetta in back over a medium–low heat. Add the drained spaghetti and egg mixture and stir thoroughly so all the spaghetti is coated in the sauce.  Add 1–2 tablespoons of the reserved pasta water to loosen, if necessary.  Serve immediately on hot plates with grated Parmesan on top.
