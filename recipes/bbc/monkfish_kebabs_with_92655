Put the monkfish into a bowl. Grate over the garlic cloves and zest over the lemon. Set the lemon aside.Add the olive oil, ground cardamom, the white part of the sliced spring onion, salt and pepper and work the marinade into the fish using your hands. Cover the bowl and put into the fridge for 4–6 hours or 1 hour minimum.To make the chermoula, mix together half of the sliced spring onion greens with the remaining ingredients, apart from the lemon juice. Set aside.Put the mayonnaise, soured cream and capers into a small bowl and mix well. Season with salt and pepper.Preheat the barbecue to medium-hot.Thread the monkfish pieces onto the metal skewers and grill directly over the coals for 4–5 minutes on each side, basting with the marinated juices. The kebabs should be nicely coloured and firm to the touch. The flesh should still be blushing and moist, not dry.Spread the bottom half of each baguette with the caper mayonnaise.Carefully remove the monkfish from the skewers and divide between the baguettes, using the bread as a glove to safely handle the hot skewer.Stir the lemon juice into the chermoula and drizzle over the monkfish sandwiches, so it soaks into the bread.Garnish with the remaining spring onion and coriander leaves. Serve with the herb salad, if using.
