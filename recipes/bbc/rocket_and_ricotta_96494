When roasted place in a blender and blitz until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.To make the filling, bring a pan of water to the boil and blanch the rocket leaves for 30 seconds. Remove and refresh the rocket in cold water. Squeeze dry in a clean tea towel, then chop finely and place in a bowl. Add the ricotta, some grated nutmeg and the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper and spoon into a piping bag.To make the brown butter, heat the butter in a frying pan until it turns brown, remove from the heat and whisk in the lemon juice and a drizzle of oil. Set aside.To assemble, turn the oven up to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6, pipe some filling onto each pasta sheet and carefully roll up. Place tightly in a baking dish. Pour over the brown butter and bake for 20 minutes, until golden-brown.To serve, spoon some tomato sauce onto each plate and top with the cannelloni, tear over some burrata and finish with some grated Parmesan and rocket.
