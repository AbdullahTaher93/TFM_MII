Heat the oil in a wok over a medium heat and fry the red curry paste for two minutes, until fragrant. Add the palm sugar and cook for 4–5 minutes until the mixture is sticky.Stir in the squash and sweet potato and cook for 2–3 minutes.Add the coconut milk, coconut cream, fish sauce and the lemongrass and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to simmer for 20–30 minutes, or until the squash and potato are tender but not mushy. Add the lime pickle and king prawns and cook for 2–3 minutes, until the prawns are pink and cooked through.For the garnish, heat the oil in a wok over a low heat. Add the sliced chilli and cook slowly until all of the moisture from the chillies has evaporated (at which point the oil will stop bubbling), then turn up the heat slightly, so the chillies caramelise and crisp up. Remove the chilli slices with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat this cooking process with the sliced garlic and the shallots.To serve, divide the noodles among four shallow bowls. Top with several spoonfuls of the curry, then sprinkle each bowl with a little of the bean shoots, coriander leaves and basil leaves. Garnish with a pinch of each of the crisp fried chillies, garlic and shallots.
