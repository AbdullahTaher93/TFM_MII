Add the baby onions and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until softened.Add the kidneys and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown all over.

Set aside and keep warm.Heat a griddle pan until hot, then add the slices of sourdough and toast for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until crisp and golden-brown.Whisk together the mustard, vinegar and extra virgin olive oil in a bowl until well combined, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drizzle the dressing over the salad leaves and mix well to coat.To serve, place two pieces of toast in the centre of each of four serving plates. Spoon the kidneys and sauce over the top. Divide the salad among the plates and arrange alongside the kidneys and toast.
