Whisk together all of the dry ingredients with 185ml/6Â¼fl oz water in a bowl.Heat the oil in a 20-25cm/8-10in non-stick frying pan over a medium heat.  Add the onions and cook over a low heat for 4-5 minutes, or until soft. Add the sundried tomatoes and fry for 2 minutes.  Remove from the pan and allow to cool slightly before adding to the batter.Turn the heat up a little and use a ladle to pour half the socca batter into the pan. Cook for 6 minutes on each side, or until golden and slightly crisp.  You should be able to lift the edges of the pancake away from the pan and easily lift and flip the pancake without it breaking.  Repeat with the remaining batter.Transfer the pancakes to a plate and scatter with the avocado, roasted peppers and coriander. Season with pepper and serve immediately.
