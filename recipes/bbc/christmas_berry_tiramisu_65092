For the mulled berry compôte, place all the ingredients, except the arrowroot, in a saucepan and gently heat through. After about 10 minutes of gentle simmering, mix the arrowroot in a small bowl with some cold liquid (water or orange juice) and pour into the compôte. Stir gently until the mixture thickens.  Remove from the heat, discard the star anise and cinnamon stick and allow the compôte to cool.When the compôte is cool, prepare the cream layer. Beat the mascarpone, cream, sugar, vanilla, orange zest and Marsala in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. (At this point, place the mixture in a piping bag if you wish to pipe the cream mixture into the trifle bowl.)For the biscuit layer, whisk the jam, Marsala (or sherry) and the orange juice together and pour into a shallow dish. Add the biscuits and leave them to soak up some of the liquid, turning over to ensure a full coating.Spread some of the compôte into the bottom of the trifle dish, add about 12 of the soaked biscuits, standing them on their side, followed by a little more compôte, then the cream layer. Continue with the layers to complete the dish.Leave to stand for at least 1 hour for the flavours to mingle. Garnish with crystalised rosemary and fresh cranberries, if using.
