Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.Scrub the potatoes well, then half-peel them, leaving some of the nutritious skin on for extra flavour. Cut into fairly thin chips – about 1cm thick – which will crisp more easily. Put into a saucepan and cover with cold water. Cover the pan, bring the water to the boil over a high heat and cook the potatoes for 3 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 2-3 minutes.Put the olive oil into a baking tray and heat in the oven for a minute. Add the drained, dried chips to the hot oil, giving the tray a gentle shake to separate the chips. They should be in a single layer. Season with a little salt and black pepper, then bake for 30-40 minutes, turning the chips halfway through cooking to move the outer chips to the middle and vice versa so they all crisp evenly.Meanwhile, spray a frying pan lightly with spray oil. Heat the pan over a medium-high heat and, when hot, add the pineapple rings. Fry for 2 minutes per side, turning regularly, until the slices are golden-brown and caramelised. Set aside.Reduce the heat to medium, spray the gammon steak lightly with spray oil and fry in the same pan for 4-5 minutes, turning regularly, until the steak is nicely browned and cooked through. Set aside.Return the pan to the heat and add the Brussels sprouts. Stir-fry the sprouts for 3 minutes, adding a splash of water if necessary, until they are bright green but still retain a bit of bite.Serve the gammon steaks with the pineapple on top, with the stir-fried sprouts and chips alongside.
