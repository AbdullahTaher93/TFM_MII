Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Pick out about 200g/7oz of the small and medium-sized cauliflower florets that have a good circular shape and set aside.To make the cauliflower mash, place the remaining florets and the stalk in a saucepan. Pour in the cream, add the garlic and 50g/1¾oz of the butter. Simmer over a medium heat for 10 minutes. Add the raclette cheese and plenty of salt and pepper. Cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the cauliflower is soft.Add the contents of the pan to a blender and blend to a purée. Push through a sieve into a clean pan, ready to reheat to serve.To make the roasted cauliflower, bring a large pan of water to the boil, add the reserved florets and cook for 2–3 minutes, or until tender. Drain and return to the pan with the remaining butter and the yeast extract. Stir until the butter has melted and the florets are coated. Tip into a small roasting tin and roast in the oven for 20 minutes. Grate the Parmesan all over before serving.Meanwhile, place the grapes in a separate roasting tin and roast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until sticky and soft.Heat a griddle pan over a very high heat and season the steaks with salt and pepper. Cook for 1–2 minutes on each side – this type of steak is best served very rare or it will become tough.Rest the steaks for 10 minutes, before slicing and serving with the cauliflower mash, roasted florets and grapes.
