Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Grease and line a 20cm/8in square loose-based cake tin with baking paper.Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium–low heat. Stir in both sugars and cook for 1–2 minutes, or until the butter is absorbed and the mixture turns a creamy toffee colour and looks smooth and glossy. Take off the heat and set aside.Whisk the eggs, vanilla and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk in the melted butter and sugar mixture until thoroughly combined, then whisk in the flour until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 20 minutes.While the blondie is cooking, cut 125g/4½oz of the chocolate eggs in half. It’s best to use the heel rather than the tip of the knife and work with just a couple of the eggs at a time.When the 20 minutes is up, take the blondie out of the oven and scatter the halved and whole chocolate eggs on top. Carefully press the eggs into the blondie mixture and don’t worry if the surface cracks at little. (Take care as the sides of the tin will be hot.) Return to the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the blondie is pale golden-brown.Cool the blondie in the tin for at least 10 minutes before cutting into squares. Serve warm or cold.
