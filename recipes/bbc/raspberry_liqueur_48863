Preheat the oven to 125C/115 Fan/Gas Â½. Line a baking tray with baking paper.For the pavolva, whisk the sugar and egg whites in a large bowl until the mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks. Fold in the cocoa powder, vinegar and chopped chocolate. Spoon the meringue mixture on to the prepared baking tray and shape into a circle. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until crisp on the outside and marshmallow-like on the inside. Set the meringue aside to cool.For the ganache, heat the butter and 300ml/10fl oz of the cream in a small saucepan over a low heat, until the butter melts and the mixture is simmering. Add the chocolate and stir to melt. Take off the heat and whisk to thoroughly combine all the ingredients. Stir in the raspberries and raspberry liqueur. While the ganache is still soft, spread it evenly over the top of the pavlova, using just enough so it is covered. For the remaining ganache, leave to chill in the fridge until firm and then roll into small balls to make truffles.Whip the remaining cream until it forms soft peaks and then spread it over the ganache on the pavlova. To decorate, top the pavlova with the truffles, chocolate curls and raspberries.
