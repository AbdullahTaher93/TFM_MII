Put the cockles in a large, lidded saucepan placed over a high heat with a splash of water. Add the garlic and thyme and steam until the cockles have opened. Discard any cockles that remain closed.Drain the potatoes and set aside to steam dry.Pick the cockle meat from the shells and put into a clean bowl, discarding the shells. Strain the cooking liquid onto the cockles, add the samphire, vinegar, shallot and dill and season.
