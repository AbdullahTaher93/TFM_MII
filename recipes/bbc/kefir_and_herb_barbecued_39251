After an hour, add the sugar, vinegar and garlic and mix well.Heat the sunflower oil in a frying pan, add the onion, ground fennel and coriander seeds and cayenne and cook for about 15 minutes over a low-medium heat, until soft and slightly caramelised. Remove from the heat and cool.Add the onion to the carrots and mix well. Pour into a sterilised jar and place in the fridge, where they will keep for up to a month.To cook the chicken, preheat the barbecue, carefully place the chicken pieces on the grill and cook for 10â€“15 minutes on each side, turning regularly to avoid burning them.
