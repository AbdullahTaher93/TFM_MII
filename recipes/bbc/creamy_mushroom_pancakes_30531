Whisk together the egg and milk in a small bowl or cup.Put the flour into a large bowl and season generously with salt and pepper. Make a well in the centre and pour in the egg and milk mixture. Gradually whisk them into the flour to make a batter. Set aside.Heat the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat until foaming but not burning or browning. Stir in the spring onions, reserving a little of the green part, and cook until soft. Add the mushrooms and cook until soft. Season and stir in the crème fraîche and mustard. Tip into a bowl, cover with foil and keep warm.Wipe the frying pan clean and heat another small knob of butter until foaming. Tip half the batter into the centre of the pan and swirl around until the base of the pan is covered. Cook until just golden on the bottom, then flip over and cook the other side until golden-brown. Set aside and repeat to make the second pancake.Put the pancakes on a plate and spoon the mushrooms into the centre of each. Fold the edges over, starting with the bottom, to create a square. Sprinkle with the remaining spring onion and serve.
