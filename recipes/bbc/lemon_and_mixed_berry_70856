Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.Line a 18x28cm/7x11in Swiss roll tin with baking paper and lightly spray with cooking spray.Put the sugar and eggs in a large mixing bowl and whisk using an electric hand-held mixer for 6–8 minutes, or until pale and thickened.Sift the flour into the mixture and gently fold in using a metal spoon. Spoon into the prepared tin and spread with the back of a spoon until evenly covered.Bake for 8–10 minutes, or until springy to the touch.Allow to cool for 1–2 minutes, then turn out onto a large sheet of baking paper. Carefully peel off the lining paper and cover with a clean, damp tea towel and leave until cool.Meanwhile, put the berries in a large bowl and roughly mash with a fork. Add the lemon zest, lemon curd, soft cheese and icing sugar and stir well. Spread  over the sponge in an even layer.Using the baking paper to help you, roll up the sponge from one of the long sides. Light dust with a little icing sugar if desired, cut into slices and serve with the extra berries.
