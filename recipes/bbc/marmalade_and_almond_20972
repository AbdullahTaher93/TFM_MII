Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3 and line a 20cm/8in tart tin with the pastry.Make an almond paste by beating together the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the eggs one by one, beating well between each addition. Mix in the ground almonds, then place in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes.Spread a very generous amount of the marmalade on the base of the tart. Top with the almond paste and scatter over the flaked almonds. Bake for 40–50 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and the filling golden and risen..Serve the tart in slices with clotted cream or crème fraîche.
