Season the guinea fowl chunks with salt and pepper and coat with plain flour.In a large heavy-based frying pan, heat the extra virgin olive oil.  When hot, add the floured guinea fowl and seal well on all sides until golden-brown and quite crispy.At this stage, reduce the heat to low, add the garlic and rosemary, cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes, turning the meat from time to time.After 30 minutes increase the heat to high, remove the lid, add the white wine (if you wish you could flamb√© the fowl now) or allow to evaporate.To make the bruschetta, when the guinea fowl is ready, toast some slices of bread. Immediately rub on some garlic and drizzle some of the olive oil from the guinea fowl sauce.  Serve the guinea fowl with slices of bruschetta.
