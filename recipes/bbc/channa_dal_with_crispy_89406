Put the marrow peas in a pan and cover with an inch of water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 40 minutes, skimming off the scum that rises to the surface. After 25 minutes, add the yellow split peas and top up the water if needed. Skim off the scum and stir in the turmeric.Once the peas are cooked, take off the heat and stir in the butter.Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the cumin seeds and green chillies. Fry for 30 seconds, then add the garlic and curry leaves and fry for a further 30 seconds. Stir the mixture into the dal and season well.To make the poories, combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.  Add the ghee and rub into the flour using your fingertips.Gradually add the cold water, drawing more flour into the well as you go, until the mixture comes together as a firm dough.Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for 1–2 minutes, then wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.When the dough has chilled, divide it into golf-ball sized portions. Roll each out into 2mm thick flat discs.Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. Drop a piece of dough into the oil; if it rises to the surface, the oil is ready for frying.Carefully lower the puri into the hot oil one at a time. Fry for 30–45 seconds on each side, or until light golden-brown ad puffed up. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.Ladle the dal onto serving plates. Pile 1–2 puri alongside each serving, scatter with coriander and serve.
