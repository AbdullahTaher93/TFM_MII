Reduce the heat and simmer for 6-8 minutes, or until the beans are tender but still have a bite. Stir in the toasted almonds.In another pan, heat the remaining oil and fry the prawns for 4-5 minutes, or until cooked through. Drizzle over the honey and lemon juice in the last few minutes of cooking.To serve, pile the runner bean salad onto a serving plate and scatter over the prawns. Drizzle over the juice from the pan, sprinkle over the cayenne pepper and garnish with the sprig of dill and lime half.
