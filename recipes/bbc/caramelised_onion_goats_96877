To make the dough, put the flour, yeast, garlic and salt into a bowl. Add 150–175ml/5–6fl oz water and stir with a wooden spoon until combined and a soft dough is formed. Tip out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes until a smooth dough is formed.Oil a large, clean bowl, add the dough and cover with cling film. Put in a warm place and leave to prove for about 1–1½ hours or until doubled in size.Meanwhile, for the topping, heat the oil in a lidded frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and fry for a few minutes until they are beginning to soften. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes until soft. Add the sugar and vinegar, turn up the heat and stir for a few minutes until golden. Set aside to cool.Preheat the oven 240C/220 Fan/Gas 8. Preheat a large baking tray in the oven.Tip the proven dough out onto a floured work surface and knead into a ball to lightly knock back. Using your fingers or knuckles, push the dough to about a 30cm/12in circle, with slightly thicker edges to form the crust.Put the base onto baking paper. Spread the passata on top of the dough, scatter with the cooked onions, scrunch up the Parma ham, place on top and finish with dollops of goats’ cheese. Slide onto the preheated tray and bake for 12–15 minutes, or until golden and the dough is cooked.Garnish with basil leaves, drizzle witha little olive oil and serve with dressed salad leaves.
