Mix the buttermilk, egg and melted butter in a large bowl until smooth and blended. Sift together the tapioca flour, fine cornmeal, salt and bicarbonate of soda, then gently stir into the buttermilk until the ingredients are just moistened - don't worry about lumps.Heat a heavy iron or non-stick pan until medium-hot. Grease with a little clarified butter. Spoon a generous tablespoon of batter onto the pan and spread with the back of the spoon.Cook until the bubbles rise and break on the top of the pancake, then flip over gently. Cook until pale golden. Remove and keep warm. Continue until all the batter has been used.Spread each pancake with butter and serve a stack of three per person with crispy bacon and maple syrup.
