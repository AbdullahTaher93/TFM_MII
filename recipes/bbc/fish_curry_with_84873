To make the lemon couscous, put the couscous into a large bowl and cover with boiling water to 1cm/½in above the level of couscous. Add the butter, then cover tightly with cling film and set aside for 20 minutes.To make the curry, put the fish into a bowl, and sprinkle over the paprika and ½ teaspoon turmeric. Add a pinch of salt and mix well to coat the fish.Heat the oil in a large lidded non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat and fry the fish for 3–4 minutes on each side, until cooked all the way through and golden-brown. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside to keep warm.Add the garlic, onions, chilli and salt to the same pan and cook for 5 minutes on a low to medium heat, until the onions have softened. Add the turmeric, cumin and coriander and cook for a few more minutes. Add 200ml/7fl oz water and leave to cook gently on a low heat for a few more minutes. Add the watercress, then cover the pan and cook for 2 minutes, until it has wilted. Return the fish and any resting juices to the pan and mix through gently, just enough to warm the fish through.Meanwhile, remove the cling film from the couscous and fluff up with a fork. Add the lemon zest and salt and mix well.Serve the curry with the couscous on the side, garnished with pea shoots or micro herbs and the lemon wedges.
