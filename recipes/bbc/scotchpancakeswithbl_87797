Preheat a large heavy-bottomed frying pan.Place the flour into a bowl and make a well in the centre. Break in the eggs and whisk, adding a little milk as you go, to form a smooth batter, then whisk in the icing sugar.Brush the pan with a little oil then add large spoonfuls of the batter. Cook for 1–2 minutes, until small bubbles appear on the surface, then turn over and cook for another 1–2 minutes, until lightly golden.Divide the pancakes between two warm serving plates. Top with the blackberries and drizzle over the maple syrup (if using).
