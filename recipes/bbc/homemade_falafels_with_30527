Put the chickpeas in a saucepan and mash with a potato masher until as smooth as possible. (If you have a non-stick pan, use a plastic masher  to protect the coating.)Add the spring onions, cumin, lemon zest, flour and salt. Season with lots of black pepper and mix well with a wooden spoon.Using your hands, form the mixture into six equal-sized balls and flatten slightly.Add 2 teaspoons of the oil to a frying pan over a low heat. Add the falafel and cook for 4 minutes. Flip onto the other side and add another 2 teaspoons of oil to the pan. Cook for a further 3â€“4 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp on both sides.Meanwhile put the cucumber, tomato and lettuce in a large bowl. Squeeze the juice of half the lemon into a small bowl, add a pinch of salt and pepper and using a fork whisk together with the olive oil to make a dressing. Pour over the salad and mix well.Lightly toast the pitta breads then carefully slice open along one side using a sharp knife.When ready to serve, arrange a little salad in each pitta, top with some of the falafels and add a squeeze of juice from the remaining lemon half. Add a spoonful of yoghurt, chilli sauce or hummus (or a bit of all three!) Serve with the remaining salad alongside.
