Preheat the oven to 190C/170 Fan/Gas 5. Line a large baking tray with baking paper.Put the duck on the prepared baking tray. Combine all the spices and garlic granules in a bowl, then rub the mixture all over the duck and inside the cavity. Season well with salt and roast for 2 hours. (Do not baste the duck during this time as you want to keep the skin as dry and crisp as possible.)Increase the oven temperature to 220C/200 Fan/Gas 7, and cook the duck for a further 20 minutes.Meanwhile, in a small saucepan set over a low heat, combine the pomegranate molasses and honey and gently heat until the mixture begins to bubble. Remove from the heat and set aside.When the duck is cooked, remove from the oven and cover loosely with kitchen foil. Leave to rest for 10 minutes. Heat the pancakes according to the packet instructions and keep warm.To make the martini, put the chopped preserved lemons in a saucepan, stir in 6 tablespoons water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Pour the mixture into a mixing bowl, then blitz using a hand blender. Stir in the honey, then the vodka, and mix well. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice and add the mixture. Shake for 3 minutes, then strain into chilled martini glasses and garnish each with a slice of preserved lemon.Serve the sauce, spring onion and cucumber strips, pomegranate seeds and the pancakes in separate bowls. Using two forks, shred the duck at the table. Fill a pancake with some duck meat and crispy skin, some vegetable strips and a few pomegranate seeds, drizzle over a good helping of the sauce, roll up the pancake and enjoy with the lemon martini.
