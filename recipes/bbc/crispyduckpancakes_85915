For the duck, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Carefully place the duck breast into the hot oil and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper, then shred the duck into fine pieces using two forks.For the sauce, place all of the sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix well.To make the pancakes, spread equal amounts of the sauce onto each pancake, then sprinkle over equal amounts of the duck. Top with the cucumber, red pepper and onion and roll up.To serve, place the pancakes onto serving plates.
