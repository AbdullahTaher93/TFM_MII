For the tagliatelle, place the flour, eggs and salt into a food processor and pulse until well-combined. Knead on a floured work surface to bring the dough together, then wind through a pasta machine several times, starting from the thickest setting and working down to the thinnest, until smooth and elastic. Cut tagliatelle from the pasta dough, using the relevant machine attachment, or cut into strips.Cook the pasta in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and set aside.For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a saucepan and lightly fry the red pepper and peas for 4-5 minutes. Add the sliced fennel and white wine, reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.To serve, mix together the olive oil and the parsley leaves in a small bowl. Stir the cooked tagliatelle into the sauce and pile onto a serving plate. Drizzle over the parsley oil and serve.
