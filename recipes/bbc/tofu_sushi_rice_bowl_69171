Drain, place back in the pan, cover and set aside.Bring a small saucepan of water to the boil and cook the soya beans for 2 minutes, or until tender. Drain, refresh under cold water and set aside.To make the dressing, put the lime zest, juice and honey (or agave) in a small saucepan and simmer for 1 minute. Stir in the tamari, vinegar and sesame oil and set aside.Cut the tofu into 1.5cm/½in cubes. Spray a large frying pan with a little low-calorie cooking spray and place over a medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook for 1 minute on each side until crisp and golden brown.Place the rice in a bowl or lunchbox and stir in the dressing.
