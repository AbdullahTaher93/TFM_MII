For the pastry, put the flour, spices and sugar in a mixing bowl. Rub in the butter, then add the egg yolks and bring the dough together. Wrap in cling film and chill for an hour.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Set aside approximately a third of the chilled pastry to make a lattice top. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the remaining pastry to the thickness of a pound coin and line a 23–25cm/9–10in tart tin. Make a lattice by rolling out the reserved pastry and cutting it into 25cm/10in ribbons. Weave the pastry ribbons together leaving equal spaces between each ribbon (so squares of jam will be visible between the pastry).Fill the pastry case with apricot jam and place the lattice on top. Trim the edges using a knife.Mix the raspberry jam with the lemon zest and juice and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle (alternatively place in a small food bag and snip off one corner). Pipe the jam into alternate squares of the lattice top. Put an almond on top of each square filled with jam.Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden-brown. Leave to cool in the tin.To serve, dust the torte with icing sugar, cut into slices and with a spoonful of crème fraîche alongside.
