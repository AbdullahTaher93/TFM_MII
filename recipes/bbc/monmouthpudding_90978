For the pudding, preheat the grill to a medium setting.Sprinkle the breadcrumbs and brown sugar into a roasting tray. Shake the tray to mix the two together, then grill until the breadcrumbs are lightly toasted and the sugar has started to melt. Set aside.Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.Heat the milk, lemon zest, sugar and butter in a pan over a medium heat. Cook, stirring regularly, until the butter has melted and the mixture is well combined, then stir the toasted breadcrumbs and sugar into the milk mixture and set aside, off the heat, for 30 minutes.Once the milk and breadcrumbs mixture has stood for 30 minutes, whisk the egg yolks in a bowl until pale and fluffy, then add them to the milk and breadcrumb mixture and whisk gently until well combined.Pour the pudding mixture into a 20cm/8in ovenproof serving dish and bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the pudding has risen and is just set. (The pudding has set when a skewer inserted into the middle of the pudding comes out clean.)Remove the pudding from the oven and increase the temperate to 180C/350F/Gas 4.For the topping, spread the raspberry jam in an even layer over the pudding. Sprinkle over the raspberries.In a bowl, add the sugar to the whisked egg whites and continue whisking until the mixture is glossy and stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.Spoon the meringue over the pudding and return to the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the meringue is golden-brown.Serve immediately.
