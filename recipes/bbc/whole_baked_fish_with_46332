Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Boil the potatoes for 10 minutes in a large pan of water until just tender. Drain, and allow to cool slightly, then slice them lengthways into about 5mm/Â¼in thick slices.Put the potatoes in a large baking dish or roasting tin lined with baking paper and mix with the lemon slices and onion seeds. Remove the sundried tomatoes from their oil, reserving the oil and roughly chop the tomatoes. Mix into the potatoes along with 3 tablespoons of the reserved oil. Season with salt, pepper and the sugar and mix well.Season the fish inside and out and place the herbs into the belly cavities, dividing between the fish. Place the fish on top of the potatoes and drizzle over the remaining reserved sundried tomato oil.Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the fish is just cooked through and the potatoes are crisping up. Remove from the oven and serve.
