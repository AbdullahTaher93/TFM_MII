Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.To make the prawn toast, place the prawns, two teaspoons of the olive oil and the parsley into a food processor. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend to a paste.Spread the paste over the bread slices, cut the slices into triangles and sprinkle with sesame seeds.Heat the remaining one tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan. Add the bread slices, sesame-side down, and fry for two minutes, or until golden.To make the noodle salad, place the olive oil and lemon juice into a bowl and mix together. Add the cucumber, toss to coat and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle over the chopped mint.To make the noodle garnish, heat the vegetable oil in a deep heavy bottomed saucepan, until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when added. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended!)Carefully add the noodles to the hot oil. They will immediately puff up on contact with the hot oil. After only a few seconds of cooking, carefully remove the noodles with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.To serve, place the prawn toasts onto a large warm plate. Serve the salad alongside and garnish with the crispy noodles.
