Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking paper.To make the scones, put the flours, onion salt and butter into a bowl and rub together using your fingertips to a breadcrumb consistency. Mix in the cheese. Make a well in the centre and add the milk. Bring the dough together with your hands (be careful not to knead or the dough will become tough). Dust a clean surface with flour and press the dough out to the thickness of about 2cm/1in.Cut out the scones using a 5cm/2in cutter and place onto the tray. Bring the offcuts together gently, being careful not to knead and cut out as many circles as you can until there's no more dough. Brush the tops with milk and bake for 12â€“15 minutes or until they are golden and well risen. Cool on a wire rack.To make the chive butter, mix all the ingredients together and tip onto a piece of cling film. Roll to create a sausage shape, wrap and twist the ends. Refrigerate until set and ready to serve.Serve the warm scones with the chive butter.
