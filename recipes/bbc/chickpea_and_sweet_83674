Rinse the rice in a sieve under cold water until it runs clear then place into a large, lidded saucepan. Cover with enough boiling water so that it rises about 1 inch above the top of the rice. Bring it to the boil over a high heat, place the lid on tight and turn the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes and then turn the heat off. Leave the lid on until the curry has cooked. Don't be tempted to look!Meanwhile, add a little oil to a large saucepan and add the curry powder and garlic. Tip in the coconut milk, lime juice, zest and sweet potato. Cook for 15 minutes or until the potato is soft. Add the chickpeas and frozen peas until warmed through. Serve with the rice.
