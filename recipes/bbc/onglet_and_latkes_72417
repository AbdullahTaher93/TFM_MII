Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Melt the butter in a frying pan. Remove from the heat, add the steaks, cover and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.Put the marrow bones in a roasting tin and roast for 20-25 minutes. Turn the oven off and leave them inside to keep warm.Meanwhile, for the latkes, put the grated potatoes into a clean tea towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Put them in a mixing bowl with the flour, egg and herbs and season with salt and pepper. Shape into four large, thin patties (donâ€™t make them too thick or they will be raw in the middle).Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the latkes on both sides until they are golden. Drain on kitchen paper.Heat a heavy-based cast-iron griddle until it smokes. Lift the onglet steaks out of the butter and blot off any excess fat using kitchen paper (reserve the steak butter). Season the steaks with salt and pepper. Sear them for 2 minutes on each side, then transfer to a board and leave to rest in a warm place.Heat the steak butter in its frying pan and use it to fry the eggs. Season with salt and pepper.To serve, divide the steaks, latkes and bone marrow between four serving plates and top with the eggs.
