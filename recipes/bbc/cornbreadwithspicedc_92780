Stir in the lemon juice and garlic and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat half of the oil in a 20-25cm/8-10in ovenproof frying pan over a medium to high heat. When the oil is smoking, pour in the cornbread batter. Fry for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until beginning to set.Drizzle the remaining oil over the cornbread, then transfer the pan to the oven and continue to cook for a further 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile, for the topping, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat.
