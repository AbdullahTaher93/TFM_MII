Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. Drain and set aside.Destone the avocado, then put the avocado flesh, garlic, coconut oil, salt, lemon juice, zest and mint leaves into a blender with 4 tablespoons of water. (Alternatively, you can put everything in a bowl or pan and use a stick blender.)Blend until you get a smooth paste. If you find the mixture is struggling to move, add another tablespoon of water and try again. Put the pasta into a serving bowl and pour over the sauce. Add the peas and mix until all the pasta is coated in green goodness.For a little kick, I like to take a red chilli and grate it over the top. This is optional, but worth doing if you like chilli!
