Drain the chickpeas in a sieve over a jug – you should have around 150ml/5fl oz of aquafaba liquid. Weigh out 50g/1¾oz of the liquid. If you need to make more French toast, you can double or triple the ingredients. Keep the remaining chickpea water and chickpeas covered in the fridge for up to three days and use in other recipes.Mix the 50g/1¾oz aquafaba, maple syrup and vanilla in a medium bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Brush the bread on both sides with the aquafaba mixture until it is used up.Place the bread carefully into the hot pan and cook over a medium heat for around 3 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Move the bread as it cooks so that it doesn’t stick.Pour the remaining oil into the pan and turn the bread over. Cook on the other side for around 3 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp.Transfer the French toast to two plates and top with the berries. Dust with sifted icing sugar and serve with extra maple syrup for drizzling if you like.
