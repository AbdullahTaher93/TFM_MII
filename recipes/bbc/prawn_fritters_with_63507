For the prawn fritters, mix the prawns with the lime juice, onion, chillies, shallot, coriander and spring onion. Leave in the fridge overnight. If you don't have time, an hour will be enough.Just before youâ€™re ready to cook the prawns, add the cornflour and egg to the mixture. Season with salt and pepper.For the saffron aioli, put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with the garlic, lemon juice and salt. Whisk together. Very gradually whisk in the olive oil until you have a glistening sauce with the consistency of soft butter. Stir in the saffron, cover and chill until needed.Preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Drop tablespoons of the prawn mixture into the hot oil. You will need to cook them in 4 batches - do not crowd the fryer. Fry them for 2 minutes, or until golden-brown. Drain the cooked fritters on kitchen paper and leave to rest until you have fried the remaining mixture.To serve, place the fritters in a large bowl and dip indulgently into the aioli.
