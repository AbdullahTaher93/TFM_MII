Sift the flour into a bowl and add the diced butter.Rub with your fingertips, or pulse in a food processor, until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.Add the sugar, sultanas and beaten egg and mix well to form a ball of dough, using a splash of milk if needed.Roll the dough out on a floured board to a thickness of about 5mm/½in.Cut into rounds with a 7.5–10cm/3-4in plain cutter.Rub a bakestone or heavy iron griddle with butter, wipe away the excess and place on the hob until it is heated through.Cook the Welsh cakes a few at a time for 2–3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown.Remove from the griddle and dust with caster sugar while still warm.
