Place a lidded saucepan over a medium heat. Lightly toast the cumin seeds for 1â€“2 minutes, then tip into a bowl.Add the oil and popping corn to the pan and stir well. Cover with the lid and cook for a few minutes, shaking the pan every few seconds, until the corn starts to pop. Keep shaking constantly while popping to avoid burning the corn.Mix together the toasted cumin seeds, curry powder, cinnamon and lime zest.Sprinkle the seasoning and a little sea salt over the popcorn and serve immediately.
