Cover with a lid and steam for 30 seconds. Take off the heat, remove the razor clams with a slotted spoon and place in a container to chill in the fridge. Pass the cooking liquor through a sieve and set aside.When razor clams are chilled, take off their shells, discard the skirt and wash off any brown parts.
