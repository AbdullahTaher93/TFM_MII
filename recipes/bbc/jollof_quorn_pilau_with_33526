Start by making the jollof spice mix. Put all the spices into a large jar. We only need a little for this recipe – the rest can be covered and put away from another occasion.For the pilau, soak the rice in a large bowl of cold water.For the salted cucumber, put the cucumber, onion and salt into a bowl. Give it a stir and set aside.To make the pilau, you need a large saucepan with a lid – the dish will be made in one pot. Put the pan on a high heat and add the oil. As soon as the oil is hot, add the onion and salt, and cook until the onion is soft.Now add the Quorn and fry it with the onions for a few minutes. Add 4 tablespoons of the jollof spice mix and stir well. If the spices start to stick to the base of the pan, add a small splash of water. Cook the spices for at least 10 minutes on a low heat.Drain the rice in a sieve, making sure you remove all the water. Add the rice to the pan of onions and Quorn, and stir it in so it gets coated with all the delicious spices.Boil a full kettle of water and have it at the ready. Pour boiling water on to the rice and keep going until the water is a couple of centimetres above the rice. I like to be accurate and even have a rice ruler to make sure.Boil on a high heat, making sure to stir all the time. As soon as all the water has been absorbed, pop a lid on the pan and leave the rice to steam for 15 minutes on the lowest hob setting. When the rice is ready, fluff it up, using a fork.Drain the cucumber in a colander and rinse with a little water to get rid of any excess salt. The cucumber and onion should be soft. Serve alongside the rice.
