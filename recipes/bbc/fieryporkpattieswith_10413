To make the patties, simply tip all of the ingredients (except the seasoned flour and vegetable oil) into a large bowl and mix well with clean hands.With slightly moist hands, divide the mixture in six to eight small round patties.Dip the patties in seasoned flour until evenly coated, shaking off any excess.Place on a baking tray and refrigerate for about 30 minutes or until ready to use.Just before you cook the patties, prepare the pickled cucumber by simply mixing together all the ingredients. Set to one side.Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan and shallow-fry the patties in batches for four to five minutes, turning once, until cooked through and golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper.To serve, place the drained pickled cucumber in the centre of the plate and top with the patties. Garnish with coriander.
