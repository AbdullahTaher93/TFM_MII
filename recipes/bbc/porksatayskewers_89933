For the satay sauce, heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion, garlic and chilli for five minutes, until soft, but not browned.Add the curry paste and lime leaves and lemongrass and cook for a further three minutes.Add the coconut milk, cinnamon, peanut butter, fish sauce, palm sugar or demerara and half of the lime juice and bring to the boil, then simmer for ten minutes (thin with a little water or stock if too thick).Slice the pork into medallions, then dredge in the cinnamon.Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat and, when foaming, add the pork and fry for five minutes, turning once, or until completely cooked through.To serve, thread the pork medallions onto skewers. Place a naan bread onto each of four plates and place a pork skewer on top. Spoon over the sauce and serve.
