Leave the oven on.Warm the honey in a small pan over a low heat. Chop 10 strawberries and add them to the pan.  Allow it to cool a little before spreading it over the set custard.Gently warm the remaining 85g/3oz sugar in a baking tray in the oven for 5-10 minutes.Using a hand-held whisk or free-standing mixer with whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites in a clean dry bowl until firm, then whisk in the warmed sugar.Place the meringue in a piping bag and pipe a lattice over the pudding, sprinkle with icing sugar and return to the oven for 5-10 minutes to brown the meringue.Allow to cool, then decorate round the outside with the remaining strawberries, halved, like jewels in a queenâ€™s crown.Dust again with icing sugar and serve at room temperature.
