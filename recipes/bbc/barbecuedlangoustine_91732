In a bowl, mix together the oil, white wine vinegar, garlic and parsley in a bowl. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Add the langoustines and reserved langoustine shells to the marinade mixture, cover and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.Meanwhile, light the barbecue 30 minutes before you want to eat. Soak 12 wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes, then shake off any excess water.When the barbecue coals are ash-white and the langoustines have marinated, thread three langoustines onto each skewer and place onto the barbecue grill. Cook, turning regularly and basting with the remaining marinade mixture, until pink and completely cooked through, then serve.
