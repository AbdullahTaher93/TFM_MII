For the turkey, place the turkey slices between two pieces of cling film then use a rolling pin or meat hammer to press to about 5mm/¼in thick.Remove the cling film and place the cheese on top of one half of the turkey slices, top with the ham and sage then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Fold the other half of the turkey over the top and press down lightly. Secure the edge with the rosemary skewer.Heat 50g/1¾oz of the butter and the olive oil in a frying pan. Add the turkey parcel and fry on each side for 2–3 minutes until the turkey is cooked through and the cheese is just starting to ooze out.Add the Marsala and deglaze by scraping any caramelised juices from the base of the pan. Cook until the liquid has reduced enough to just coat the turkey.Remove the turkey from the pan and place on a plate to rest.Return the frying pan to the heat, add the remaining butter and heat until nut-brown (to make a beurre noisette). Add the lemon juice and parsley and stir through. Season to taste with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper.For the garnish, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the beans and simmer for 3–4 minutes, or until just tender.Drain, toss with a little of the butter and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat a frying pan until medium hot, add the remaining butter, cavolo nero and 50ml/1¾fl oz water. Cook gently until the cabbage is tender. Season to taste with salt, black pepper and a little freshly grated nutmeg.To serve, place a turkey parcel on each plate and pile the beans and cavolo nero alongside. Spoon the beurre noisette over the top and finish with a squeeze of lemon.
