Blend the salsa ingredients together in a food processor until roughly chopped, then set aside.To make the potatoes in milk, spread the butter onto the base of a wide, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Put in the potatoes, season well and cover with the milk. Add the bay leaves and fennel. Cut a circle of baking paper the size of your pan and place it on the milk. Cook over a medium heat for 20 minutes. Remove the paper and turn up the heat until the milk has reduced and the potatoes have slightly caramelised. Set aside to rest.Meanwhile, to cook the fish, heat a dash of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Lightly score the fish skin and season with salt. Fry the fish skin-side down for 3â€“4 minutes.

Add a knob of butter and a squeeze of lemon.Divide the fish between two plates, drizzle with the salsa and serve with the potatoes.
