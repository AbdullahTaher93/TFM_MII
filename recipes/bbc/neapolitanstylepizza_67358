Preheat the oven to 250C/500F/Gas 9.In a large bowl, place the flour and salt together.  Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water and gradually add to the flour.  Mix well until you obtain a dough.  If you  find the dough too sticky, just add a little flour.Shape the dough into a ball and leave to rest covered with a cloth for 5 minutes.  After this time, you will find the dough much more pliable to work with.  Knead the  dough and split into two.  Knead each piece for a couple of minutes each and form into balls.  Sprinkle some flour on a clean kitchen cloth and place the dough on it  covering with a slightly damp cloth.  Leave to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.Place the tomatoes in a bowl and squash them slightly, add salt and pepper and mix well.Sprinkle some flour on a clean work surface and with your fingers spread the dough into a roughly round shape with a border.  Make the dough as thin as a pancake  but beware not to split the dough.  Sprinkle some breadcrumbs on two large flat baking sheets and place the pizza bases on them.Spread a little of the tomato evenly over each base  -  not put too much as the pizza will go soggy.  Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with parmesan cheese, add a few  basil leaves or sprinkle some oregano and top with pieces of mozzarella cheese.  Then add topping of your choice.Place in the hot oven for 7 minutes (a couple of minutes longer if you prefer your pizza crispy).  Remove from the oven, drizzle with some olive oil and eat immediately - pizzas are not very nice cold or reheated!
