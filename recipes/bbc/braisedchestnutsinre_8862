Drain and rinse the chestnuts, remove the loose skins and discard any chestnuts with suspicious-looking holes.Place the chestnuts, carrot, celery, leek, onion, garlic, loose spices and oil in a large saucepan (1.5 litre/3 pint capacity). Fry together until the mixture starts to brown. Add the water and wine, bring to the boil and simmer with lid on for 1½ hours. The chestnuts should be tender but not fall apart.Strain the stock into a clean pan, pick out the chestnuts and save as a garnish (if desired). Discard the remaining vegetable mixture.Mix the yeast extract, cornflour, and tomato pureé to a paste with 4 tablespoons cold water and stir into the hot chestnut stock. Bring to the boil stirring frequently. Simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened. Serve with a nut roast or your favourite vegetarian or vegan roast.
