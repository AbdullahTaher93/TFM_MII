Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.For the filling, place the pieces of pepper, carrots and butternut squash into a deep-sided, lidded pan. Add enough boiling water to just cover the vegetables. Cover the pan with the lid and return to the boil. Boil for four minutes, or until the vegetables are tender, then drain well.Transfer the drained vegetables to a large bowl and add the remaining filling ingredients. Mix together until well combined, then set aside until completely cool.For the patties, in a bowl, mix together the flour, ground turmeric and salt in a bowl until well combined.Add the butter cubes and rub them into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.Add the water, a tablespoon at a time, stirring the mixture with a spoon, until it comes together as a dough. (NB: You may not need to use all of the water.) Roll the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.When the pastry has chilled, roll it out onto a lightly floured work surface to a 0.5cm/¼in thickness. Cut six to eight 7.5cm/3in discs from the pastry using a cookie cutter or upturned mug.Divide the filling mixture equally among the pastry discs, covering only one half of each disc and leaving a 1cm/½in border at the edge of each.Brush the edges of the pastry discs lightly with some of the beaten egg, then fold the free half of each disc over the filled half and press down the edges to seal using a fork.Brush the tops of the patties with the remaining beaten egg. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and place the patties onto it. Bake the patties in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown.
