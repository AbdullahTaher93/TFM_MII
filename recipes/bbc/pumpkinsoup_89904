Pour in the stock, season well and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, half cover the pan with a lid and continue to cook for about 40 minutes until the squash is really tender when tested with the point of a knife.Pick out the bay leaf and blend the soup until smooth using a stick blender.Add the cream and a little more stock if the soup is on the thick side, taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper as required.Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the pumpkin seeds and fry quickly until the seeds start to pop. Remove from the pan.Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with a swirl of cream and the toasted pumpkin seeds.
