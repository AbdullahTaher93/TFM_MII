Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Put the garlic granules, sesame oil, mirin, soy sauce, honey and chilli flakes in a resealable food bag and shake well.Add the chicken thigh halves and mix to coat – you can do this by holding the outside of the bag and squishing around.Tip out onto a small baking tray, pouring over all the marinade, then bake for 15–20 minutes, or until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through.Toss the cooked chicken in any remaining sauce from the tray and transfer to a serving plate. Sprinkle with the spring onions and sesame seeds and serve with the lime wedges to squeeze over.
