To make the grilled chicken, preheat the grill to medium. Mix the olive oil, honey, sweet chilli sauce and soy sauce together in a small bowl. Pour half of the mixture over the chicken breast to coat.Season with salt and pepper then put on a baking tray and grill for 6–7 minutes. Remove the chicken breast from the grill, turn it over and spoon over the remaining mixture. Grill for a further 6–7 minutes until lightly charred and cooked through. The juices will run clear when pierced with a skewer at the thickest point when it’s cooked.To make the poached chicken, dissolve the stock cube in a mug of boiling water. Put the chicken in a small saucepan and pour over the stock. Add enough water to cover the chicken breast.Bring to the boil then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 10–12 minutes. Don’t worry about any white foam on the surface of the water as this is normal. You can skim it off or just leave it.Remove the chicken from the poaching liquid and place on a board to cool. Season with salt and pepper, then slice and pack into a lunchbox, or arrange on a plate, toasted seeds and salad, if using.To make the pan-fried chicken, put the chicken breast on a sheet of cling film or greaseproof paper and cover with another sheet of cling film or greaseproof paper. Bash with a rolling pin until 1–2cm/½–¾in thick.Remove from the cling film and season both sides with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. When hot, add the chicken breast and cook for 5 minutes until golden brown. Turn and cook for a further 5 minutes.
