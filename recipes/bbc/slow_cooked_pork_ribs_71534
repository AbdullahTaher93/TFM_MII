To make the pork ribs, place the stock, herbs, spices, vegetables and vinegar in a large heavy bottomed pan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and add the pork ribs, turning to coat. Cover with a lid and simmer very gently for 1–2 hours or until soft and falling away from the bone. Allow to cool, then shred the meat and discard the bones.Strain the cooking liquid through a sieve into a clean saucepan. Bring to the boil and reduce the sauce to a glossy consistency. Fold this through the meat, season with salt and pepper and keep warm.To make the monkfish, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and add the garlic and thyme. Add the monkfish and cook for 2 minutes on both sides. Add the butter and transfer the pan to the oven. Roast for 6-8 minutes then finish with lemon juice and set aside.To make the cabbage, mix together the vinegar, cider, pepper, bay, juniper, sugar, salt and caraway with 200ml/7fl oz water and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and cool completely.Pour the liquid over the cabbage in a bowl and leave for 3–4 hours. Remove the leaves from the cabbage and cut out the spine.

When ready to serve, remove and shred the cabbage parcels thinly.To serve, place a thin layer of pork on a plate, slice the monkfish thinly and lay on top.
