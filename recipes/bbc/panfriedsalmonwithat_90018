For the salmon, heat the olive oil and butter in a pan and season the fish with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Lay the fish skin-side down into the pan and fry for 4-5 minutes, then flip over and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown all over and cooked to your liking. Set aside on a warm plate.For the sauce, place the cream and fish stock into a pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce the mixture for 4-5 minutes, or until thickened slightly, then stir in the fresh herbs.To serve, place the salmon onto a serving plate and arrange the blanched vegetables alongside. Pour the cream sauce around the edge of the plate.
