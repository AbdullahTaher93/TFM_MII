Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Line a high-sided baking tray with baking parchment.Blend all of the ingredients except the carrot in a food processor until smooth and well combined.Add the carrot to the food processor and pulse a few times to combine, being careful not to over-blend (the carrot should provide texture and colour to this snack).Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking tray, spreading and smoothing it into an even layer using a palette knife.Bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes, or until cooked through and browned on top. Remove and set aside to cool slightly, then cut into squares. Serve warm or cold.
