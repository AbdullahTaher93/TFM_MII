For the rosti, blanch the peas in a pan of boiling salted water for two minutes or until just tender then drain well. Refresh in a bowl of iced water and drain again.Squeeze the courgettes in a clean tea towel and place in a large bowl. Mix in the blanched peas, ground rice, basil, parmesan and pine nuts then add the beaten eggs and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Divide the mixture into 16 evenly sized balls and slightly flatten each one.Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and fry half the rosti for 2-3 minutes on each side or until crisp and golden-brown. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining oil and rostis.To make the dressing, place the ingredients in a bowl, mix until well combined and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.Place a stack of rosti on each plate, drizzle a little dressing over and around the rosti and garnish with a sprinkling of shredded basil leaves.
