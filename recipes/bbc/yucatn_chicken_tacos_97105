To make the marinade, place all the ingredients into a large bowl and mix well. Add the chicken and turn several times until well coated. Cover the bowl and put in the fridge to marinate for 30–60 minutes.Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Line a large baking tray with baking paper. Place the marinated chicken on the prepared tray.Brush the chicken generously with more of the marinade. Roast in the preheated oven for 20–25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through and the marinade is slightly charred in places. The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear with no trace of pink when the thickest part of the fillet is pierced with a skewer.Meanwhile, make the pickled red onion. Put the onion in a heatproof bowl. Cover with just-boiled water and leave to stand for 10 minutes. Drain well and then stir in the vinegar and caster sugar. Leave to stand for at least 10 minutes before draining and serving.Transfer the chicken to a board and tear into pieces with two forks. To serve, place the chicken on the warmed tortillas and top with the lettuce, avocado, pickled onions and soured cream.
