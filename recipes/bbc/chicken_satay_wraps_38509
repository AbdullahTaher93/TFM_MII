To make the satay sauce, put the peanut butter in a small bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons of just-boiled water. Mix in the chilli sauce, soy sauce and lime juice. Transfer to a shallow serving dish and place in the centre of a large board or platter.Trim the bottom of the lettuce and carefully separate 8 large leaves. Donâ€™t worry if they tear a little as you work towards the middle of the lettuce. Rinse the leaves and pat dry.Cut the chicken breasts into thin slices and place on the board or platter with the satay sauce. Arrange the lettuce leaves, cucumber, carrot, pepper, radishes and coriander in separate piles beside the chicken. Put the chilli and spring onions in separate small dishes on the board.To assemble the wraps, place a selection of the vegetables into the lettuce leaves. Add a couple of chicken slices and then top with the satay sauce, spring onions and chillies to taste. Garnish with the fresh coriander and add a squeeze of lime before wrapping the rest of the leaf around the filling. Serve immediately.
