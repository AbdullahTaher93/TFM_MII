Preheat the oven to 200C/Fan 180C/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with baking paper.Put the flour, baking powder and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and rub in until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.In another bowl, beat together the egg and milk, reserving a tablespoon of the mixture to use as an egg wash. Add to the flour mixture, along with the glacé cherries, stirring to form a dough. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead briefly until smooth.Gently press the dough out to a thickness of 2.5cm/1in and cut out circles using a biscuit cutter. Arrange the scones on a baking tray, spaced slightly apart, and brush the tops with the reserved egg wash.Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until golden-brown and risen. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly and serve.
