Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Put the sweet potatoes in a baking tray, pour over 1 tablespoon of the oil, season and toss. Roast for 40 minutes, or until browning at the edges and tender.Meanwhile, pour the remaining oil into a shallow casserole dish or ovenproof sauté pan and place over a medium–low heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 10 minutes, or until starting to soften, stirring occasionally.Add the peppers and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, vinegar, sugar, capers and tomato purée and season with a little salt and plenty of pepper. Cover, bring to the boil, then turn down the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add the fish to the pan and gently turn it over so it is covered in the sauce. Cook, covered with a lid, for 10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the sauce slightly reduced.To make the salad, put the salad leaves in a bowl and toss with the oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt.Serve the fish in the sauce with the sweet potatoes and salad.
