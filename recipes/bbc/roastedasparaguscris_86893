For the salad, melt the butter in a hot griddle pan, add the asparagus and griddle for five minutes, or until slightly charred on all sides.Heat another non-stick frying pan, add the prosciutto and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until crisp.Poach two eggs in a shallow pan of gently simmering water for four minutes, or until just cooked. To do this, gently swirl the pan of water to make a whirlpool and crack each egg individually into the middle of the whirlpool. Remove from the simmering water with a slotted spoon and set aside.To make the dressing, melt the butter with the chilli flakes and cayenne pepper in a small saucepan. Stir in the ketchup and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in the chives and remove from the heat.To serve, pile the roasted asparagus onto a serving plate, top with the two poached eggs and the crisp prosciutto. Drizzle over the dressing and serve.
