To make the dough, place the flour and salt into a mixing bowl and stir in the oil and water gradually, mixing all the time until it is incorporated. Add a splash of water if the mixture seems dry. Set aside for at least 15 minutes.To make the filling, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Put the squash in a roasting tin, drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 25–40 minutes, or until coloured and soft. Once slightly cooled, crush using a fork.Heat the butter in a frying pan and add the wild mushrooms. Cook for 2–3 minutes. Stir in the crushed squash and chopped sage.Take the dough out of the bowl and roll it out on a lightly dusted work surface until it is a very thin and flat pancake shape. Cut out 20–25 x 8cm/3¼in diameter circles from the dough. Spoon the squash and mushroom mixture into the middle, taking care not to over-fill. Moisten the edges with a little water and fold over to make a semi-circle. Pinch and crimp the edges together to create dumpling shapes.Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the dumplings and simmer for 5 minutes, or until cooked and risen to the surface. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and leave to cool slightly.Mix together the sesame oil, soy sauce, fish sauce and pickled ginger in a bowl.Divide the dumplings between four bowls or arrange on a platter and sprinkle with the sesame seeds, micro coriander and chilli flakes, if using. Serve immediately with the dipping sauce.
