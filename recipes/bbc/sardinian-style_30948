Heat the oil in a large casserole or saucepan. Add the onion, carrot, celery and fennel. Fry gently until softened and starting to take on colour – around 10–15 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a minute or two, then stir in the fregola and borlotti beans.Pour over the stock (or water) and add the herbs and parmesan rind (if using). Season well with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down slightly somewhere between a simmer and a boil and cook for 15 minutes.Blanch the broad beans in a pan of boiling water for 1 minute, drain and, when cool enough to handle, peel. Set aside.Meanwhile, add the tomatoes to the pan and cook for a further 5 minutes, then add the cabbage, green beans, courgettes and broad beans.Simmer for a further 5 minutes, covered or until the green vegetables are tender, then add the peas. Continue to simmer for another 1–2 minutes. Check for seasoning and add a squeeze of lemon if you like.To serve, finely chop the basil and parsley and mix them with the oil – alternatively blend them all together in a blender or food processor.Serve the soup with the herbed oil and sprinkle with the cheese.
