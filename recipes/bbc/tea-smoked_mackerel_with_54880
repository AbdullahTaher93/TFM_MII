To make the potato salad, put the new potatoes in a saucepan, cover with cold water and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and cook for 15 –20 minutes, or until tender. Drain and allow to cool.Meanwhile, set up a smoker with the tea leaves and wood chips placed in the bottom. (CAUTION: Tea-smoking generates a lot of smoke. Cook in a well-ventilated area, and open the wok outside if possible.). Put the mackerel fillets on top, cover with the lid and smoke for 2–3 minutes.In a large bowl, mix together the dill, watercress, spring onions and the cooled potatoes.To make the dressing, whisk together ingredients in a small bowl.Pour the dressing over the potato salad and mix well. Break up the fish fillets and stir through the salad. Serve.
