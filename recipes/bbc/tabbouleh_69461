Put the couscous and butter into a bowl with enough boiling water to cover the couscous by about 1cm/½in (about 300ml/10fl oz). Cover with cling film and set aside while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.Put the crushed garlic, tomatoes, carrot, yellow pepper, spring onions, pomegranate seeds, olive oil, lemon juice and zest, parsley and salt into a large bowl and give everything a really good mix. I like to do this using my hands – it gets all the juices released ready for when the couscous is added, so it can absorb them all.Uncover the couscous and fluff it up, using a fork. Add it to the parsley mixture and stir through. Serve.
