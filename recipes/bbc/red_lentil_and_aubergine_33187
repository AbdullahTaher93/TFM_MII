Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Put the lentils into a bowl. Cover with water and set aside to soak.Put the potatoes into a saucepan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 15–18 minutes until just tender.Heat the oil in a large sauté pan, add the onions and cook over a medium heat for 5–6 minutes until just softening.Add the garlic, thyme, oregano and cinnamon and cook for 1 minute, stir in the tomato purée and cook for a further minute.Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Fill the tomato tin with water and add to the pan. Do this another two times and add the stock cube (this should be 800ml/1pint 8fl oz of water in total).Drain the lentils and stir into the tomato sauce, bring to the boil and simmer over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes until the lentils are soft and the liquid nearly all absorbed.Meanwhile, drain the potatoes and run under cold water until cool enough to hold. Using a spoon, scrape the skin off of the potatoes, then cut into slices about 7mm/⅜in thick and set aside (if using new potatoes, keep the skin on).Heat a griddle pan until hot then griddle the aubergine in batches until browned and softened.Spoon half the lentil sauce into a medium ovenproof dish then layer half the potatoes and aubergines over the top. Top with the remaining lentils, potatoes and aubergines.Put the ricotta into a small bowl and stir in the grated cheese. Spoon the mixture over the aubergines and smooth out to cover the top.Bake in the oven for 20–25 minutes, or until heated through and golden brown.Serve with a green salad.
