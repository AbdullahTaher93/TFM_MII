Preheat the oven to 140C/Fan 120C/Gas 1.Put all the ingredients, except the pork, into a blender and blend until fairly smooth.Line a roasting tin with foil, making sure there is enough foil hanging over the sides to fold into a parcel. Place the pork on top of the foil and pour over the marinade, turning over to make sure it is completely covered.Bring the foil together to make a parcel then put in the oven. Bake for between 2–3 hours, making sure you check after 2 hours – the meat should be cooked through and tender but nowhere near falling off the bone.Cook the polenta according to packet instructions and season well.Remove from the oven and transfer to a chopping board. Pouring off any cooking juices and transfer to a small saucepan. When the ribs are cool enough to handle, cut into individual ribs – it is easier to follow the bone by turning bone side up.To finish cooking, either prepare a barbecue, preheat your grill or heat a griddle pan until it is too hot to hold your hand over. Grill or griddle the ribs until well browned and nicely charred in places – this should take 3–4 minutes on each side.Reheat the pan juices and serve on the side with the ribs, along with lemon wedges and polenta.
