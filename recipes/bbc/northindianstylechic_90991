Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Heat two tablespoons of the sunflower oil in a frying pan over a high heat. When the oil is almost smoking, add the chicken breasts, skin-side down. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the skin is golden-brown, then turn the chicken breasts over and fry for a further 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown all over.Transfer the chicken breasts to a roasting tray and roast in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until completely cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.) Remove from the roasting tray and set aside on a warm plate.Meanwhile, boil the potato cubes in salted water for 10-15 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and set aside.Heat the remaining two tablespoons of sunflower oil in a deep-sided pan over a medium heat. Add the blended onions and fry for 8-10 minutes, stirring regularly and adding more oil as necessary to prevent the onions from sticking to the base of the pan.Add the garlic and ginger, and continue to fry, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes.Add the turmeric, curry powder and cinnamon sticks, stir well and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the spices are fragrant.Pour in the stock, coconut cream and coconut milk. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the volume of liquid has reduced by about a half and the sauce has thickened.Add the cooked potato cubes and peas and return the curry mixture to the boil.To serve, divide the curried potato and pea sauce equally among four serving bowls. Top each with one of the reserved chicken breasts. Sprinkle over the toasted almonds and coriander leaves.
