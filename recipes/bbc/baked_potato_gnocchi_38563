Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Bake the potatoes for 45â€“50 minutes, or until soft.Meanwhile, heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat. Fry the cavolo nero until crisp. Season with a little salt and drain on kitchen paper.Heat another tablespoon of oil in the same pan and fry the pumpkin gently until just soft and golden brown. Season with a little salt and drain on kitchen paper.Scoop out the potato flesh and pass through a mouli. Place the skins back on the baking sheet and bake for a further 12 minutes, or until golden brown.Meanwhile, place a double layer of cling film over your work surface. Put the potato flesh into the centre, sprinkle over some salt and knead briefly. Add a little of the egg and the flour. Gather the cling film over the dough and knead very lightly. Roll it into a sausage shape and chill. Remove the cling film and cut out 2.5cm/1in pieces.Meanwhile, transfer the potato skins to a medium pan and cover with 500ml cream. Bring to the boil and simmer gently. As the skins soften, press them with back of a spoon until the flavour is extracted from them. Reduce the cream by a third and pass through a sieve into a bowl. Stir in the remaining 30ml/1fl oz cream and season well with salt and a little lemon juice to taste. Transfer the cream to a foam gun, shake well and add two pellets.To serve, warm the pumpkin and shallow-fry the gnocchi in butter on both sides for a few minutes, until piping hot.Place the gnocchi on serving plates and scatter over half of the pumpkin cubes. Gently pipe over the foam in small amounts and scatter with the remaining pumpkin cubes, the cavolo nero and chives. Serve immediately.
