To make the filling, heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, add the onion and salt, and cook until soft and lightly brown. Add the cumin and peas and cook for a few minutes. Stir in the dill, along with the mashed potato, and mix well, then transfer to a bowl and leave to cool completely.To assemble, line a baking tray with baking paper. Mix the flour and 4 tablespoons water together in a small bowl to make a ‘glue’.Put a heaped tablespoon of filling in the centre of one half, leaving space around the edges. Fold one side of the oatcake over the filling, then fold the other side over. Brush the seams and edges with the ‘glue’, press the edges together to seal any holes. Place on the lined baking tray, and repeat with the rest of the oatcakes and filling. Put the samosas in the freezer for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 190C or until a cube of bread turns brown in one minute when dropped in. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Fry the samosas in batches, cooking for a couple of minutes on each side, until they are crisp and golden-brown. Drain on kitchen paper, and serve warm.
