Cook on each side for 2-3 minutes, or until the bar marks appear.Place the cheese and beer in a frying pan and heat gently until the cheese is melted, and the sauce is bubbling and smooth. Stir in the mustard, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce. Add the white and brown crab meats, flour and egg yolk. Cook until just thickened then season, to taste, with salt and black pepper. Finish with the chopped chives. Spread the mixture on the griddled sourdough and place under a hot grill for 1-2 minutes or until golden-brown and bubbling.For the green salad and French dressing, put the salad leaves in a large bowl.
