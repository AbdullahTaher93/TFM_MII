Tip the oats into a small saucepan with the milk and 100ml/3½fl oz water. Slowly bring to the boil, stirring. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5–10 minutes, until thick and creamy, stirring regularly to prevent the oats from sticking to the bottom of the pan.If you're making the chocolate and nut porridge, stir the cocoa and sugar (if using) into the porridge as soon as it’s cooked.Remove from the heat, cover with a lid and leave to stand for 3–5 minutes. Add your desired toppings and serve.
