To make the poached salmon, bring 2 tablespoons of water to the boil in a saucepan and slowly whisk in the butter, being careful not to split it. Add the salmon to the pan, reduce the heat to low and poach for 6–8 minutes. Add the lobster claw and cook for a further 2 minutes. Remove the salmon and the lobster claw and set aside.To make the lobster sauce, heat the olive oil in a medium sauté pan and cook the shells and vegetables together for 20 minutes. Add the vermouth and reduce the volume of the liquid by half, then add the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes, star anise and coriander seeds. Simmer for 10 minutes, add enough water to just cover the shells and vegetables and then simmer for 1 hour.Crush shells and vegetables, then strain the broth into a bowl, discarding the shells and vegetables. Pour the broth back into the pan and reduce until you have a thick sauce. Season with salt and pepper.Mix the chickpeas and coriander ingredients together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.To serve, spoon some of the marinated chickpeas into a serving bowl, add the hot lobster stock and top with the salmon and the claw.
