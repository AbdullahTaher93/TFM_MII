Meanwhile, make a slit along the side of the sausages, peel the skin off and discard.Lay a sheet of filo pastry on a clean work surface and brush with the melted butter. Layer another sheet on top and brush with more butter. Lay two sausages along the shortest edge of the filo, then roll it up to form a long sausage. Cut into four pieces and place onto the baking tray. Repeat this step another two times.Brush the tops of the rolls with any remaining butter and bake in the oven for 25 minutes until cooked through and golden-brown.
