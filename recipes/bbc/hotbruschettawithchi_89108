Heat another tablespoon of the olive oil in a frying pan and lightly fry the chopped aubergine flesh, then add the garlic, chilli flakes, chicken and tomato. Fry for 5-6 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the chopped parsley.Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the ciabatta bread and grill for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until the bread is toasted all over.Spoon the chicken, aubergine and tomato mixture on top of the toasted bread, and garnish with the lemon zest and chopped chives.
