(Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water.)Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring regularly, until the butter has melted and the mixture has thickened.Pour the mixture into the cooked pastry case, cover with clingfilm (to prevent a skin forming) and set aside to cool.Arrange the orange slices on the cooled tart and sprinkle over the demerara sugar.Using a cooks' blowtorch, heat the sugar until caramelised.To serve, slice the tart and serve with double cream or custard.
