Set one quarter of the marinade mixture aside in a bowl to dress the salad later.For the quail, place the quail into the main batch of marinade, cover and allow to marinate for 30 minutes.Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Add the marinated quail and griddle for 3-4 minutes on each side, basting regularly with the marinade, or until completely cooked through.To serve, arrange the drained daikon sticks into four bundles and place onto two plates. Place a shiso leaf on top of each bundle.Cut each quail half into two pieces, then place a piece of quail onto each diakon bundle.Place the sharon fruit and mango into the reserved dressing (do not use the mixture used to marinate the quail for this step) and mix well to coat. Spoon the dressed fruit over the top of quail pieces. Season with a pinch of the sancho pepper and sea salt.
