Add the onion and garlic and fry gently for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned.While the onion is cooking, cut the chorizo into roughly 1.5cm/½in slices.

Bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering.Drain the chickpeas in a sieve and rinse under cold water. Add them to the tomato mixture and return it to a simmer. Continue to simmer for 8-10 minutes, stirring once or twice, until the volume of sauce has reduced by about half.Add the kale to the stew and continue to simmer for a further 1-2 minutes, or until tender. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, ladle the stew into serving bowls and serve with crusty bread.
