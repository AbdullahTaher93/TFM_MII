preheat the oven to 150C/170C Fan/Gas 2.For the almond purée, toast the almonds on a dry baking sheet for 5–8 minutes, or until lightly coloured and fragrant. While they are still warm, tip them into a bowl with the almond milk and leave to soak for 30 minutes.Melt the butter in a large frying pan and add the shallots, bay leaf and a pinch of salt. Fry for 5 minutes, or until soft and transparent. Pour in the almonds and milk and bring to the boil. Simmer for 40 minutes.Using a slotted spoon, transfer the almonds and shallots to a blender, add 2–3 tablespoons of the milk and blitz to a smooth purée. Add the cream, almond oil and three quarters of a teaspoon of salt. The purée should be silky and smooth, so add more milk to loosen if necessary. Return the purée to a smaller pan, cover with a lid and set aside.For the pollock, heat the rapeseed oil in a non-stick frying pan. Season the fillets with salt and pepper before placing them into the pan. Cook for approximately 3–4 minutes on one side. Add the butter to the pan and, once foaming, baste the fillets. Carefully turn the fillets over and cook for a further 3–4 minutes, depending of the thickness of the fillet. Remove the pan from the heat, squeeze a little lemon juice over the pollock and leave to rest for a few minutes.Place the almond purée over a low heat to warm through, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, for the sea purslane, heat a small frying pan and add the olive oil, chilli and sea purslane. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and stir quickly. Take care as you want to infuse the oil with the chilli but not wilt the sea purslane.To serve, spoon the warm almond purée onto each plate, place the pollock on top and garnish with the warm sea purslane and chilli oil.
