Spread the rice over two-thirds of the sheet, leaving a 1cm/Â½in border at the top.Spread the tuna strips and cucumber sticks lengthways across the sheet, then place the avocado slices on top.Brush the border with vinegar and roll the nori sheet up very tightly over the filling using the bamboo mat, to make a cigar shape, sealing across the border at the top.To serve, slice the roll into rounds and place onto a serving plate with the pickled ginger.
