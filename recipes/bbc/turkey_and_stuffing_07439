First thing in the morning, take the turkey out of the fridge and remove the giblets. Leave the bird to come up to room temperature for an hour or so.Meanwhile, heat a knob of butter in a saucepan and fry the onions until soft.Add the chestnuts and fry until golden-brown. Transfer everything to a tray and leave to cool.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Once the onions are cool, add them to a large mixing bowl along with the sausagemeat, cranberries, pistachios, sage, orange zest, breadcrumbs and seasoning. Work the mix into a large ball.Press the clementine into the centre of the stuffing ball and close the stuffing around it (this will help create steam and keep the turkey moist). Press the stuffing ball into the cavity of the turkey.Lay the turkey in a deep baking tray and scatter over the thyme. Pour in 250ml/9fl oz of cold water.Smear the butter all over the turkey breast, lightly score the legs, then season all over.Roast the turkey for 2 and a half hours (or 20 minutes per 500g/1lb 2oz). To check the bird is cooked,  insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the turkey leg. If it reads 72C and above, itâ€™s cooked. Remove the turkey from the oven and baste with the cooking juices.Cover with foil and leave for 30 minutes to rest before carving.
