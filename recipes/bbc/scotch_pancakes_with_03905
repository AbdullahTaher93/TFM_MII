For the pancakes, mix the flour, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Beat the milk, eggs and melted butter in a jug and pour into the well. Whisk until well combined. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.For the compôte, combine the ingredients in a saucepan and stir in 4 tablespoons water. Simmer, stirring regularly, over a medium heat, for 4–5 minutes or until the plums are soft. Remove the cinnamon stick and ginger and set aside.For the baked plums, place the plums, cut-side up, in a small ovenproof dish. Smear each plum half with a little of the vanilla paste and dot with the butter. Sprinkle with the sugar and bake for 20 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned in places.For the amaretto cream, place the cream and amaretto in a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form.To cook the pancakes, heat a little of the butter with a little oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium–high heat. Add four large spoonfuls of the batter to the pan, spaced well apart. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until the batter is almost set on top and golden brown underneath.Flip the pancakes over and cook on the other side for a further 2 minutes, or until golden. Keep the pancakes warm on a plate in a low oven and make two more batches in exactly the same way, adding a little extra milk if the batter thickens too much to spread easily.Place the pancakes in small stacks on the warmed plates and top with the compote. Arrange a couple of baked plums alongside, finish with a dollop of amaretto cream and serve immediately.
