Turn the oven up to 230C/210C Fan/Gas 8 and roast for a further 10 minutes, until well cooked.Remove from the oven and pour the cooking juices into a jug. Allow the duck to cool then remove the meat from the bone and shred onto a clean plate. Set aside covered until needed.Mix the cooking juices with the hoisin sauce to serve and set aside.Mix together the ingredients for the dressing in a small bowl and set aside.Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Deep-fry the wontons for 40 seconds, or until golden and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and season with the salt, white pepper and chives.To serve, top each wonton with some shredded duck and drizzle over both the cooking liquid and hoisin mixture and the dressing.
