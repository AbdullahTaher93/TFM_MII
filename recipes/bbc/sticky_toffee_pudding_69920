Add the remaining ingredients and blend to a thick batter.Divide the mixture between the moulds and place on a baking sheet. Cook in the oven for 25-30 minutes.For the toffee sauce, in a pan over a medium heat warm the butter, sugar and cream, stirring continuously until all the sugar has dissolved. Bring to a rolling boil for two minutes, again stirring constantly. Sieve into a bowl and set aside.To serve, turn out the puddings onto the serving plates and drizzle over the toffee sauce.
