For the stew, heat the oil in a large saucepan and add the garlic. Stir-fry for 1–2 minutes, or until softened. Add the green beans and cook for 4–5 minutes, or until they are a vibrant green and have softened slightly.Add the spices and fresh tomatoes to the saucepan, then increase the heat and add the tinned tomatoes, sugar and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the beans are well cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced.For the harissa oil, put the harissa into a small jug and mix in enough olive oil to create a slightly runny consistency.Serve the stew in warmed bowls, dotted with dollops of labneh and harissa oil and scattered with the peanuts.
