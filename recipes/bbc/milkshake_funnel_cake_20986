Start by heating some oil gently in a small pan, just big enough to fry one cake at a time – the oil should come halfway up the sides, ideally in a small pan so you don’t use too much oil.Put the flour, icing sugar, baking powder, milk and eggs into a bowl and whisk until you have a smooth batter.Either put the mixture in a zip-lock bag and snip about 5mm/¼in off the end (or you can use a squeezy bottle – although you should take care squirting the mixture into the oil, and not do this quickly). If using a zip-lock bag, you could use a bag clip to stop the flow when you put it down.In one smooth motion, squeeze out the mixture in layered rounds, making sure that the batter connects to itself so that it has something to hold on to. It should look like a spindly doughnut. Fry for roughly 1 minute on each side, or until golden-brown.Put some kitchen paper on a tray and drain the funnel cake on the paper. As soon as the funnel cake comes out of the hot oil, sprinkle it generously with the strawberry milkshake powder and get frying the next one. Serve hot.
