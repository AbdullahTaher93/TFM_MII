Reserve the remaining lime.Combine the citrus juice/water mixture and the sugar in a small saucepan. Heat until the sugar has dissolved, stirring once or twice. Add the lemongrass, lime zest and ginger and then bring to a boil. Immediately reduce the heat to a simmer.Simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the syrup to cool.For the fruit salad, remove the seeds from the pomegranate and slice the banana.Peel another slice of zest from the lime using a vegetable peeler, avoiding any of the white pith. Slice it very finely and reserve this for decoration. Set aside the remaining lime as you will need the juice.Cut the grapes in half and slice the kiwi.Finally chop the pear and apple, pouring a little lime juice over the apple to retain its colour.Combine all the fruit in a large bowl or in individual serving dishes or Martini glasses.
