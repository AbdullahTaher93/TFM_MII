Set aside to cool and reduce the oven temperature to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan. Add the onions and fry over a medium-high heat for 2â€“3 minutes, or until soft. Add the garlic and fry for a further minute. Tip in the passata and season with the sugar and some salt and black pepper. Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid. Lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the onions are soft and the sauce has reduced and thickened.
