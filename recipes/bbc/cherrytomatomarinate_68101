Cut the feta into 40 even squares and place in a bowl.  Pour over the olive oil; add the lemon zest, oregano and cracked black pepper.  Leave to marinate for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight.To assemble, take a skewer and place a cherry tomato first, follow with a cube of the feta.  You could prepare the skewers to this stage in advance, just keep refrigerated.Finish each one with a basil leaf.  Skewer one tip of the leaf then the other tip so it looks like a little sail.  Repeat until you have forty skewers.
