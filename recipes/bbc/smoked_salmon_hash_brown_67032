Strain through a sieve.Put the liquid and the egg yolks in a food processor and blend. With the motor running, gradually add the clarified butter until you have a smooth sauce. Finish with the lemon juice, mustard and cayenne pepper. Set aside and keep warm (cover the mixture to prevent a skin from forming on the surface).For the smoked salmon hash brown, place the potato, salmon, smoked salmon, crème fraîche and dill in a large bowl and mix.
