For the pasta, place all of the pasta ingredients into a food processor and pulse until the mixture comes together to form a dough. Tip out onto a floured work surface and knead lightly, then roll out very thinly (use a pasta machine if you have one) and cut into strips using a pasta-cutting wheel.Cook the pasta in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, or until cooked but still al dente, then drain and set aside.For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a pan and gently fry the onion for 2-3 minutes, then stir in the tomatoes, anchovies and wine. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, or until reduced slightly, then stir in the spinach to wilt.Add the cooked pasta to the sauce, mix well to coat, season with black pepper and garnish with the fresh basil leaves.
