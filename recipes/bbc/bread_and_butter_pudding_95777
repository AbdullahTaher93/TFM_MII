Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.To make the caramel cream, heat the sugar in a frying pan, swirling every so often, until you have a dark caramel. Pour in 300ml/10fl oz of double cream. Whip the remaining double cream until it falls off the whisk in ribbons, and then fold it into the caramel cream mixture. Sieve into a clean bowl, cover and allow to set overnight.To make the bread and butter pudding, scatter some of the dried fruit into the bottom of a shallow baking dish. Melt the butter over a medium heat. Brush the bread slices generously with the melted butter and put a layer on top of the dried fruit. Continue to layer like this until the fruit and bread is all used up, finishing with a layer of bread.Mix together the eggs and sugar in a large heatproof bowl. Bring the milk and vanilla to a simmer and pour this over the egg mixture. Pour in the cream and mix, then strain though a fine sieve, discarding the vanilla pod. Pour the mixture over the bread, pushing it down to absorb all the liquid.Bake for 40â€“50 minutes, until just set. Once cool, gently heat the jam in a saucepan over a low heat. Glaze the top of the pudding with the warm apricot jam.To serve, cut out the bread and butter pudding into potions. Transfer to serving bowls and add a spoonful of the caramel cream alongside.
