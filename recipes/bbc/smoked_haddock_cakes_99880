For the haddock cakes, bring the milk to a simmer in a heavy-based pan and add the haddock fillets. Cook over a low heat for 3–4 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through, then remove from the pan and set aside to cool slightly. Discard the milk.Remove the skin from the haddock fillets and flake the flesh into a bowl, discarding any bones.Meanwhile cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water for 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain, then return the potatoes to the pan and cook for one minute to drive off any excess moisture. Pass the potatoes through a ricer or mash well in a bowl. Mix the flaked fish into the mashed potatoes.Peel and chop the two hard-boiled eggs and stir into the fish and potato mixture. Add the capers, gherkins, shallots and parsley to the bowl and mix well to combine. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.With slightly damp hands, divide the mixture into eight equal portions and shape each portion into a small cake. Dredge each cake in the flour, then dip into the beaten eggs and then roll in the breadcrumbs to coat. Place the fish cakes onto a plate, cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for one hour, or until set.Half-fill a deep, heavy-based pan with vegetable oil and heat to 180C/350F, checking the temperature using a digital thermometer. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Fry the fish cakes in small batches for 3–4 minutes, turning them over halfway, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.For the wilted watercress and spinach, heat the butter in a frying pan until foaming, then fry the watercress and spinach for 1–2 minutes, or until wilted. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, divide the wilted watercress and spinach among four serving plates and top each serving with two fish cakes.
