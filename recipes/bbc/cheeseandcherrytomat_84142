Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, courgette, salt, freshly ground black pepper and cheddar and mix well.In a separate bowl, mix together the milk, egg and olive oil. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well.Grease ten muffin moulds and half-fill each with the mix.Prick each cherry tomato - this stops them popping when they cook - and press one tomato into the top of each spoonful of mix.Spoon the remaining mixture over each muffin to conceal the tomato. Cook for about 20 minutes until golden brown.
