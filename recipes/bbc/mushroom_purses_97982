Set aside to cool.Brush one side of each sheet of filo pastry all over with a little olive oil.Place one sheet of filo pastry on top of another to create two layers of pastry, then spoon a quarter of the mushroom mixture into the centre of the pastry.Gather up the corners of the pastry to create a parcel and secure with a couple of chives.
