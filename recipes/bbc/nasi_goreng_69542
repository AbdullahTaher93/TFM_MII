For the spice paste, blend all of the spice paste ingredients together in a food processor. Add enough oil to bring the mixture together as a loose paste. Set aside.For the stir-fry, heat the oil in a wok over a high heat until shimmering hot, then add the chicken and fry for a minute or so, then add the spice paste and prawns and stir well, cooking for a good 4-5 minutes.Add the beans and spring onions and fry for another minute, keeping everything moving.Add the cooked rice and stir until it's all been incorporated - you can add a few tablespoons of water at this point if it becomes a little dry and starts to stick. Season with soy sauce and ketjap manis, to taste.Heat a little of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and fry the eggs until crisp at the edges and cooked to your liking.To serve, divide the stir-fry between two bowls, place two eggs on top and sprinkle over the garnish ingredients. Serve with the chilli oil on the side, for drizzling.
