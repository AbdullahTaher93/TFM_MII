Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.In a clean bowl, beat the chocolate and egg yolks together. Then fold the egg whites and lemon zest into the mixture.For the crêpes, in a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, eggs, oil and milk to create a light batter.Heat a crêpe pan and lightly grease with butter. Add half of the batter, swirl the mixture around the pan, to coat, and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side over a medium heat.  Remove the crêpe and place on a kitchen paper, then repeat with the other half of the batter.Place the two crêpes onto a baking sheet and fill one half of each crêpe with half of the chocolate mixture.Fold over the other halves of the crêpes to make two half-moon shapes.Place into the oven, to bake, for five minutes, or until risen.To serve, place the crêpes onto a plate.
