For the brill, season the brill fillets with salt and freshly ground black pepper then sprinkle the top of the fillets with the sesame seeds, pressing them firmly into the fish.Heat a large frying pan over moderately high heat, add the oil and butter and, when the butter is foaming, put in the fish fillets, sesame seed-side down.Fry for about five minutes, turn carefully with a fish slice and cook for a further three minutes, or until cooked through. Remove from the pan and keep warm. Garnish with the chives before serving.For the dressing, place both of the mustards, sugar, vinegar and soy into a bowl and whisk together until the sugar has dissolved.Gradually whisk in the oil until emulsified.For the coleslaw, in a ceramic or stainless steel bowl, combine all of the ingredients except for the coriander and spring onions.Allow to marinate for at least one hour (or up to 2-3 hours if you have time).Just before serving, lightly strain the excess liquid off, and stir in the coriander and spring onions.For the wontons, heat a deep fat fryer to 180C/350F or until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Separate the wonton, or spring roll wrappers, and cut into fairly fine strips.Fry until crisp and golden-brown.Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and season generously with salt.To serve, place each brill fillet onto the side of a serving plate. Spoon the coleslaw alongside the brill and top with the crispy wontons. Spoon the dressing around the plate and over the fish.
