For the curry, place a large lidded pan over a medium heat and add the oil. Add the garlic and onion and cook until softened. Add 1 teaspoon salt and if the onions stick to the pan add splashes of water.Add the chillies and tomato purée and cook for 2 minutes. Add the turmeric, chilli powder and curry powder. Add a little water and cook for 5–7 minutes, or until the oil rises to the surface.Meanwhile, thinly slice the clementine peel and add it to the pan with the 200ml/7fl oz water (or clementine juice). Cook for 10 minutes, or until the peel has melted down.Add the cod, stir and put the lid on. Cook for a few minutes, or until firm, white and cooked through. Remove from the heat and add the coriander.Put the spinach in a large pot with the garlic and a pinch of salt. Dry steam on a low heat for 3 minutes, until wilted right down; it should keep its bright-green colour. Dry steaming is cooking without any oil; rinsed spinach has enough moisture on it to steam it and cook the garlic.Serve the fish curry with the spinach on the side.
