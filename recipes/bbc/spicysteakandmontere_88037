Heat the oil in a wide frying pan. Add the beef and stir fry over a high heat for 4–5 minutes, breaking up with a wooden spoon, so it doesn’t form clumps and browns well.Add the onion, garlic, chilli and celery and stir-fry for 3–4 minutes.Crumble in the stock and add chipotle chilli paste, red kidney beans in chilli sauce and chopped tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and allow to simmer for 40 minutes or until thickened, stirring from time to time. Stir in the coriander and season well.Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Lightly grease a shallow ovenproof dish (approximately 20cm x 30cm).To assemble, lay the tortillas onto a clean work surface and divide the beef mixture down the centre of each one, rolling up to seal. Place the stuffed tortillas carefully into the prepared dish, seam side down to fit snugly.Scatter over the jalapenos and then the cheese. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 10 minutes, then remove the foil and return to the oven for 10 minutes, or until lightly golden and bubbling.Scatter over extra chopped coriander and red chilli, and serve with soured cream or crème fraîche.
