For the parkin, preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1 and butter a 20cm/8in square cake tin.Sieve the flour, salt, ginger, nutmeg and mixed spice together into a large bowl. Mix in the oat flakes.Put the syrup, treacle, butter and sugar into a small saucepan and melt over a gentle heat. Bring up to a simmer but do not boil. When the butter and sugar have melted, pour into the flour mixture and stir to combine.Mix in the beaten egg and milk to create a soft, almost pouring consistency batter.Pour into the buttered tin and bake for 50 minutes, or until firm in the centre.Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5-10 minutes before turning out and cutting into squares.For the sauce, place all the ingredients in a saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer until a syrup consistency is formed.Serve a square of parkin on each plate, then spoon over the syrup. Finish with a scoop of ice cream.
