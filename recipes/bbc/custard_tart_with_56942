Leave to macerate overnight.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.For the tart, roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface. Line a 30cm/12in tart tin with the pastry. Prick the base of the pastry with a fork and line the pastry case with a circle of baking parchment or foil and fill with baking beans.Blind bake the pastry case for 15–20 minutes, or until just lightly golden-brown, then remove the paper and beans and return the tart to the oven to cook for a further 5–10 minutes, or until pale golden-brown and dried out.Reduce the oven temperature to 110C/90C Fan/Gas ¼.Pour the cream into a saucepan and add the vanilla seeds and pods. Bring to the boil.Meanwhile beat the eggs and sugar in a heatproof bowl. Pour over the hot cream. Stir in the nutmeg, remove the vanilla pods and mix until smooth. Pass through a sieve and pour into the pastry case.Bake for an hour, or until the custard is set, but still a little wobbly. Allow to cool for a few hours before cutting.To cook the fruit, heat the wine and orange juice in a roasting tin. Pour over the rhubarb. Cover with two layers of aluminium foil and bake until just soft – do not boil. Allow to cool before serving.To serve, cut a slice of the tart and serve the rhubarb and ginger alongside.
