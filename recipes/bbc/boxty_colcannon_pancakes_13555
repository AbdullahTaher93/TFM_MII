Add a little butter and oil, when the butter begins to foam, spoon heaped tablespoons of the mixture into the frying pan and fry for 3–4 minutes on each side until golden-brown.Remove and place on a warm plate lined with kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining mixture. Keep the pancakes warm in a low oven, if necessary.For the mackerel, coat the mackerel fillets with a little oil and garlic.  Season with salt and pepper.Heat a frying pan over a high heat and add a splash of oil and the butter. When the butter is foaming, add the mackerel skin-side down and fry for 3–4 minutes until the skin is crisp and the flesh is opaque.Meanwhile, make the salad. Place the lettuce leaves in a large bowl. Mix the oil, vinegar and mustard in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper and pour over the leaves.
