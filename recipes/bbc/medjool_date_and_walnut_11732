Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 6 and grease and flour a baking tray.Put the flour into a large bowl, add the butter and rub it into the flour to make breadcrumbs. Add the sugar and salt and mix together.Pour in the milk gradually and mix in, reserving a few tablespoons for a glaze. Mix in the crème fraîche until well-combined.Add dates and walnuts, to taste, ensuring that they’re evenly dispersed.Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll out the scone dough to a thickness of 2.5cm/1in and use a round pastry cutter to cut out six scones. Re-roll any off-cuts to make more scones, but be careful not to overwork the dough.Place the scones onto the prepared baking tray and bake for 15 -20 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.Serve with good-quality strawberry jam and clotted cream.
