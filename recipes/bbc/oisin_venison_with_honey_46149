For the blackcurrant gastrique, put the sugar and vinegar in a saucepan and cook until it has reduced to a syrup and is golden in colour. Add the frozen blackcurrants and cook until the berries break down. Taste the gastrique, add more sugar if it is too sour or a little more vinegar if it is too sweet.For the honey reduction, put the honey, red wine vinegar and 450ml/16fl oz water in a saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer, cook until it has reduced in volume by two-thirds. Set aside.Peel and wash all the root vegetables. Cut all the root vegetables into the same sized chunks. Blanch the carrots and swede briefly.Bring the duck fat to a gentle simmer. Wrap the lemon thyme, garlic and rosemary in a muslin cloth and add to the duck fat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.Cook the parsnips in the duck fat for 10-15 minutes - they should be cooked through but still retain a bite. Drain the parsnips in a colander and sprinkle with a little seasoning. Once drained, cool down on a tray so they stop cooking and donâ€™t get mushy. Repeat the same process for all the remaining vegetables.When all your vegetables are done and still tepid mix them all gently. Fry the vegetables in a large non-stick pan (the pan should be big enough so that the vegetables do not overlap). When the vegetables start to turn a nice golden colour, add the honey reduction to glaze.For the butter emulsion, bring 150ml/5fl oz water to the boil. Add the salt, thyme and pepper. Leave to infuse then add the cream. While the water is still hot, add the butter and use a hand blender to create an emulsion, then add the oil and use the hand blender again. Check the seasoning, balance with a squeeze of lemon juice and pass through a fine sieve.  Leave at room temperature.For the cabbage, make a garlic butter. Mix the garlic and parsley with the softened butter. Blanch the cabbage for 1-2 minutes, then drain. Melt the garlic butter and toss the drained cabbage in it.For the venison, toast the peppercorns and juniper berries in a frying pan (as you would do with seeds) until they release an aroma, then grind using a spice grinder or in a pestle and mortar. Lightly dust the venison with the ground spices. Sear the venison gently and cook until rare, leave to rest in a warm place.Carve the venison and serve with the honey glazed vegetables and garlic butter cabbage. Drizzle over a little of the emulsion and spoon the blackcurrant gastrique over the venison.
