Heat a deep, heavy-bottomed pan, one-third filled with vegetable oil, until a breadcrumb will sizzle gently in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)Meanwhile place the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Add the cream and whisk well to make a thick batter.Add the peas and stir through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Carefully place spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil and cook for 1-2 minutes, until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper and serve warm.
