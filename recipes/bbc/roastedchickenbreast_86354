Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Heat an ovenproof frying pan with 1 tablespoon of oil until hot. Season the chicken breasts then place skin-side down into the pan. Cook for 2–3 minutes until golden-brown. Turn the breasts over and cook for a further minute.Transfer the pan into the oven and roast for 12–15 minutes, or until completely cooked through. The juices will run clear when pierced with a skewer at the thickest point. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for a few minutes.Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil over a high heat. Cook the beans and leeks for 2–3 minutes, making sure the beans still retain a little bite. Drain well.In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the mustard, vinegar and 100ml olive oil. Add the shallots, tarragon and parsley and season with salt and pepper. Slice the beans and leeks into three diagonally and add to the dressing.To serve, divide equal amounts of the bean and leek salad between four plates and top each with a roasted chicken breast. Drizzle over any extra dressing remaining in the salad bowl.
