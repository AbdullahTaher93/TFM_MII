Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5 or preheat a barbecue to hot.If using the oven, place the corn in its husks directly onto an oven rack and roast for around 40–45 minute, or until tender. Turn a couple of times with metal tongs whilst cooking. Leave to cool slightly before removing the husks.If barbecuing, bring a large pan of water to the boil and simmer the corn for 5 minutes. Drain and cook the corn on the barbecue for around 5–10 minutes, turning regularly.Mix the cheese, coriander, spring onions, chilli and lime zest in a bowl.Brush each corn on the cob with mayonnaise then dip in the cheese mixture so each cob is completely covered. Serve immediately with lime wedges.
