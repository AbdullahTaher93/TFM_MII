Line the ramekins with the cucumber leaving an overhang at the sides (this will be folded over to cover the top later).Mix together the ricotta cheese, egg yolk, salmon and smoked salmon, dill and lemon juice. Use this to fill the ramekins and smooth the tops.Fold over the cucumber and cling film to seal and place in the fridge for at least an hour.Put the ramekins in a deep ovenproof dish. Add enough boiling water to come half way up the sides of the ramekins. Cook for 15-20 minutes, then set aside to cool.For the salad, put the spinach and fris√©e in a large bowl.Combine all the other ingredients in a blender until smooth. Just before serving, toss the salad leaves in the some of the dressing. (Any leftover dressing can be kept in the fridge for a few days.)To serve, turn out the timbale onto plates and serve the dressed salad alongside. Dress the plate with the herb oil, if using.
