Pull the kale leaves off the thick stalks. Finely chop the stalks and roughly chop the leaves, then wash both. Drain well.Place the kale in a bowl with the salt, lemon juice and honey. Massage the dressing into the leaves for 2-3 minutes, bruising them so they soak up the juices. Leave for 30 minutes, then pour off the excess liquid. Add the ginger and sesame seeds, mix and dress with extra virgin olive oil, if using.
