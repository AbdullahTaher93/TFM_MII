Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and place a sheet of kitchen foil on the middle shelf.Rub the sweet potato with half a teaspoon of the olive oil and some salt. Pierce the skin several times with a sharp knife, place directly onto the top shelf of the oven and bake for 1 hour.Meanwhile, place the vegetables in a medium-sized roasting tray, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and mix well. Season with salt and pepper and roast for 20â€“25 minutes or until soft and starting to brown at the edges.Put the bulgur wheat into a heatproof bowl and pour in just enough boiling water to cover, wrap the bowl tightly with cling film and leave to stand for 30 minutes.Check the potato is cooked through by piercing with a blunt knife. When it is done, turn the oven off and leave the potato in for 15 minutes while you assemble the topping.Fluff up the bulgur wheat with a fork, then tip it into the tray with the roasted vegetables and mix well to combine. Add the dill and mix again.To serve, break the potato open and fluff up the inside with a fork, top with the bulgur wheat and vegetable mixture and a dollop of natural yoghurt.
