Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.Grease and line 2 x 18cm/7in cake tins with baking paper.Cream the butter and the sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy.Beat in the eggs, a little at a time, and stir in the vanilla extract.Fold in the flour using a large metal spoon, adding a little extra milk if necessary, to create a batter with a soft dropping consistency.Divide the mixture between the cake tins and gently spread out with a spatula.Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes, then remove from the tin and peel off the paper. Place onto a wire rack.Whip the cream with a whisk or electric handheld mixer until it forms soft peaks when the whisk is removed.Sandwich the cakes together the whipped cream and berries. Dust with icing sugar.
