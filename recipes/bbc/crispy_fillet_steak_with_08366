Mix together the potato flour and star anise and thoroughly dust the steaks, pressing the flour onto the meat to completely cover it.Heat a frying pan until hot, add the olive oil, then fry the steaks for 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove the steaks from the pan and set aside to rest for 2-3 minutes.Place the rice wine vinegar and caster sugar in a separate pan and bring to a simmer.
