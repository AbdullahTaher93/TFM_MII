Cover and refrigerate for a couple of hours so the squid turns yellow.To make the risotto put the chicken stock in a large pan over a medium heat. Bring to a gentle simmer and add the squid ink to infuse.Heat a sauté pan over a medium heat and add the butter. Once melted, add the shallots and leek and cook until softened but not coloured.Add the rice to the pan and stir until the rice is translucent and coated in butter. Add the wine and cook until the liquid has reduced by half. Add the squid ink stock, a ladle at a time, stirring until each ladleful is absorbed. Keep adding until the rice is tender but with a slight bite (about 15 minutes).When the rice is just ready, add the Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Keep the consistency porridge-like.To cook the squid, heat a large frying pan over a high heat until hot. Add the olive oil and sear for 1–2 minutes, or until the squid starts curling into tubes.Remove from the heat and add the garlic, chilli, lemon juice, zest and chopped parsley.
