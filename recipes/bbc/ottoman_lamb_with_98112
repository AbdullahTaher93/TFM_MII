For the Ottoman lamb, mix together the honey, pomegranate molasses and warm water in a bowl.Dry fry the lamb rump strips in a pan over a medium heat.Add the honey mixture and more water if needed and bring to a simmer. Cook very gently until the meat is very soft and almost melting, about 45-60 minutes.Meanwhile, place the minced lamb, cumin and chopped oregano into a bowl and mix well. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and then shape into very small meatballs, about the size of hazelnuts.When the lamb rump is very tender, add the meatballs to the pan with the figs, prunes and almonds. Simmer for 20 minutes over a low heat, then season, to taste, with more salt and pepper.Add the sliced apple and, finally, add the rosewater.For the rice pilaf, add the butter to a pan and melt gently, then stir in the rice and cook for a minute or so.Add the remaining ingredients, reduce the heat and simmer gently until the rice is tender and the liquid is all absorbed.To serve, pile the rice onto each plate and spoon the lamb alongside. Garnish with a couple of sprigs of oregano.
