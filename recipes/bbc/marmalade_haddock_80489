Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.Put the halved potatoes into a large roasting dish, along with the sun-dried tomatoes, oil, balsamic vinegar and salt, and give it all a really good stir. Place in the oven for 10â€“15 minutes to warm the potatoes through.To make the topping, put the marmalade, salt, garlic paste, chilli flakes, dill and breadcrumbs into a food processor and blend everything together.Take half of the mixture and spread it all over the fish. Put the rest of the breadcrumbs into a freezer bag and freeze, ready for the next time you need breadcrumbs for fish or chicken.Take the tray of potatoes out of the oven and place the fish on top. Put back into the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked and the topping is crunchy. Serve.
