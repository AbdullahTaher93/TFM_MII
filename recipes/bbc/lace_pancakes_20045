Sift the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the middle. In a separate bowl or jug, whisk together the egg, egg yolk and a few tablespoons of the milk, then pour into the well.Whisk gently, gradually whisking in half of the remaining milk, drawing in the rest of the flour a little at a time, to make a smooth batter. Stir in the remaining milk. Cover and leave to stand for about 15 minutes. Pour the batter into a plastic squeezy bottle.Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and brush with a little melted butter. Tilt the squeezy bottle and draw a freehand lace heart pattern in the pan using the batter.Cook the pancake over a medium-high heat for 45-60 seconds until small holes appear on the surface and the underside is lightly browned. Loosen the pancake and turn it over by flipping it with a palette knife or fish slice.Cook the other side for about 30 seconds until golden-brown. Slide the pancake out of the pan.Lightly grease the pan again before making the next pancake. Serve the pancakes as they are made, or stack them on a plate and reheat before serving. (If the pancakes are hot when you stack them they will not stick together; there is no need to interleave them with greaseproof paper.)
