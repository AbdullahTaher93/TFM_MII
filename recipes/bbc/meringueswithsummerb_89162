Preheat the oven to 130C/275F/Gas 1.Beat the egg whites and salt together in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.Add the sugar one tablespoon at a time, whisking constantly, until all the sugar is incorporated and stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed.Add the cornflour, raspberry vinegar and vanilla extract and whisk to combine.Drop spoonfuls of the meringue mixture into little heaps onto a baking tray lined with baking paper and transfer to the oven to bake for 1-1Â¼ hours, or until the outside of the meringues is crisp and the inside is marshmallow-like.To serve, place one or two meringues into each dish and top with whipped cream and the summer berries of your choice.
