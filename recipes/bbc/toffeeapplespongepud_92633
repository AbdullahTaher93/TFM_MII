Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.For the sponge, beat the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until pale and fluffy.Crack in the eggs, one at a time, beating each egg into the mixture until fully incorporated before adding the next.Fold in the flour until well combined. Add a splash of milk to loosen the mixture, as necessary. (NB: The mixture should be of dropping consistency.) Fold in the ginger.Place the chopped apples and sugar into a pan and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved and is bubbling and the apple has softened.For the sauce, bring all of the sauce ingredients to the boil in a pan, stirring constantly to form a smooth sauce that is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.Spoon a little of the sauce into eight dariole moulds. Divide the cooked apple equally among the moulds, then spoon over the sponge mixture.Place the dariole moulds into a large, deep-sided roasting tray. Pour enough boiling water into the roasting tray to reach halfway up the sides of the dariole moulds. (NB: This is called a bain-marie.) Cover the tray with aluminium foil, then transfer to the oven and cook for 25 minutes, or until the sponge has risen and is pale golden-brown.Turn out one sponge pudding onto each of six serving plates. Drizzle any remaining sauce around the edge of the plates. Drizzle the custard over the sponge puddings.
