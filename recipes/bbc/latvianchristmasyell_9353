Bring milk and butter to room temperature.Dissolve the yeast in half of the milk with 5g/1 tsp of the weighed sugar, leave in a warm place to foam (should take about 15 minutes).Beat in the remaining ingredients except the flour and the almonds.Mix in the flour till you have a smooth and elastic dough. Cover well with plastic film and place in fridge overnight.Remove from the fridge and divide the dough into three. Knock back, on a lightly floured board, and roll into even lengths, a few feet long.Plait the dough and pinch the ends to seal. Form into a ring and place on baking parchment on a tray, cover lightly with plastic film and prove till double in size.Brush with the beaten yolk (let down with a little milk), then scatter over the almonds and a good pinch of the ground cardamom.Place in the oven which has been preheated to 190C/375F/Gas 5 and bake for about 30 minutes till golden. When the base is tapped and sounds hollow, the loaf is done.Remove from the oven and dredge generously with the icing sugar.
