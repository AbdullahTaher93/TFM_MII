Cover and chill in the fridge until needed.For the squid and chorizo, heat the oil in a large, non-reactive frying pan over a high heat. Add the chorizo and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until dark golden-brown, then remove from the pan and set aside.Drain the chorizo-infused oil from the pan and reserve.Add the squid rings to the pan the chorizo was cooked in and stir fry for 3-4 minutes, or until just opaque.Add the cooked chorizo, tomatoes and the remaining crushed clove of garlic to the pan and continue to stir fry for a further minute, or until the squid rings are pale golden-brown. (NB: Take care not to overcook the squid or it will be chewy.)Add a little of the reserved chorizo-infused oil, to taste, and the lemon juice and stir to combine. Remove from the heat.To serve, place a dollop of the chickpea purée into the centre of each of four serving plates. Dot the squid and chorizo mixture around the chickpea purée.
