To make the rotis, mix the flours together. Remove 3 tablespoons of the flour mix and set aside for dusting. Add the salt, ginger, green chillies, carom seeds, fresh coriander, chilli powder, ground turmeric and chopped onions. Mix well.Add the oil and 225ml/8fl oz water and knead to form a stiff dough. If the dough feels slightly soft, add more flour and keep kneading until the dough stiffens up. Cover with a damp kitchen cloth and set aside for 5–10 minutes.Divide the dough into 8 and shape into balls.Lightly dust the work surface with some of the flour mixture and roll out the dough into circular shapes, approximately 15cm/6in in diameter.To make the koftas, mix the venison with all the other ingredients except for the onion and oil and set aside for 30 minutes. Heat half the oil in a pan and sauté the onions until they are soft. Remove with a slotted spoon and leave to cool.Add the onions to the venison mixture and mix well. Shape into patties of 60g/2½  weight. Heat the remaining oil in a pan and cook the koftas on both sides on a medium heat for about 5 minutes until they are cooked but moist inside. Set aside to rest somewhere warm.Heat a large frying pan and lay one of the dough circles on top. Cook on a dry heat for 3–4 minutes until the dough begins to dry out and starts getting some colour. Turn over  and cook on the other side. When both the sides are done brush with some ghee and turns over, repeat the same on other side and the bread is ready to be served.Serve with the yoghurt, chutney, pomegranate seeds, cress and rotis.
