Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan and gently fry the garlic with the leeks and thyme leaves (if using) for 3-4 minutes, or until the leeks are soft.Stir in the milk, cream and parsley, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for a further 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.Serve immediately, or transfer to an oven dish, cover with kitchen foil and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve.
