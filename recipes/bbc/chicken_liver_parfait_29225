Fry for 1-2 minutes, or until just golden-brown.Add the garlic, thyme and Madeira. Fry the chicken livers in the mixture for a further 1-2 minutes.Transfer the mixture to a food processor, add the remaining butter and blend to a smooth paste. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Spoon the parfait mixture into the lined loaf tin, pour over the clarified butter and top with the chives. Chill in the fridge for at least three hours, or until set.For the shallot chutney, place the butter in a large frying pan and heat until melted. Add the shallots, cover and cook on a low heat until the shallots have softened and caramelised.Add the sugar, thyme and vinegar and cook for a further 10 minutes.For the melba toast, preheat the grill to its highest setting.Place four of the slices of bread onto a baking tray and toast for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden-brown on both sides.Slice the toast horizontally and return the toast to the baking tray, soft-sides facing upwards. Grill for 1-2 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.Repeat the process with the remaining four slices of bread. Cut each slice of Melba toast into four triangles.To serve, place a quenelle (or a slice) of parfait onto each of four plates and serve with the chutney and melba toast. Garnish with basil cress.
