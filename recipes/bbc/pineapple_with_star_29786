Spread the demerara sugar over a plate and dip the pineapple in it, coating both sides. Melt the butter in a large heavy frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the pineapple, star anise, lemongrass and lime zest and cook until browned on both sides – you want the sugar to melt onto the pineapple and turn a dark brown/almost black colour.Heat the rum in a ladle, carefully set alight, and pour over the pineapple. Wait for the rum to burn off – keep on the heat until the contents of the pan look syrupy. Serve the pineapple with the syrupy juices poured over, with crème fraîche, ice cream or coconut-flavoured dairy-free ice cream on the side.
