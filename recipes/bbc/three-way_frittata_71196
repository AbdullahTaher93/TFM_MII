Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.Place an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and add a teaspoon of the oil. Stir in the sausages and smoked paprika and fry for 1 minute. Add the pepper, if using, and turn the heat down. Cover and cook for 2 minutes, or until just softened. Tip the mixture out onto a plate and set aside.Heat the remaining oil in the frying pan, stir in the potatoes and fry for 1 minute.Season the eggs then pour them into the frying pan and stir. Lower the heat and cook for 2–3 minutes, or until just set on the bottom, drawing the eggs in from the side a few times.Turn off the heat and add the tomato, peas and / or Cheddar, if using. Spoon over the sausage mixture at this point. For a twist, you could give each third of the frittata a different topping if you are serving people with different preferences.Bake for 6–8 minutes, or until puffed up and golden-brown. Leave to cool for 3 minutes before running a spatula around the edges and sliding out onto a board or plate. Cut into thirds and serve.
