Put the noodles in a bowl and pour over boiling water. Allow to stand for 10-15 minutes until the noodles are softened. Drain, then rinse under the cold tap to cool the noodles down.Put the drained noodles in a lunchbox and add the peas, beans, seeds, soy sauce, sesame oil and additional vegetables (if using). Feel free to add more vegetables that you like. Stir to coat all the vegetables in the sauce, then place the lid on and set aside until lunchtime.
