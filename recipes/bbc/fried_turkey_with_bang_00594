Cover and marinate in the fridge overnight.When you are ready to cook, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Mix the remaining turkey ingredients together in a bowl. Dip the turkey pieces into the mixture and deep-fry in batches for 6â€“8 minutes, until cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm.Deep-fry the curry leaves, drain on kitchen paper and set aside.To make the bang bang sauce, warm the peanut butter in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water until soft. Slowly stir in the remaining ingredients until you have a loose, spoonable sauce.To serve, spoon a generous amount of the sauce on the bottom of a serving plate and pile the crisp turkey on top. Garnish with the fried curry leaves and remaining serving ingredients. Drizzle over some more of the sauce and serve.
