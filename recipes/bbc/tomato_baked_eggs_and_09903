Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.To make the baked eggs, put the chopped tomatoes, chilli and paprika into a lidded, wide-based frying pan. Add a pinch of salt and pepper and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further 5 minutes. Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted.Make eight wells in the thickened sauce and crack an egg into each (they might merge, but that’s okay). Put the lid on the pan and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still soft.Meanwhile, slice the baguette diagonally, not cutting completely through, leaving a 4cm/1½in gap inbetween each slice.Mix together the remaining garlic and butter and spread a little inbetween each slice. Bake for 5 minutes until toasted. Serve with the baked eggs.
