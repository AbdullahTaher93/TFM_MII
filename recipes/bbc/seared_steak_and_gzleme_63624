Preheat a barbecue or griddle pan over a high heat. To make the marinade, mix the walnut oil, paprika, cumin, thyme and oregano together in a roasting tin and set aside.Season the steaks with salt and pepper, then seal on the barbecue or griddle, turning every minute or so, until the outside is charred but the meat is still very rare. Place the steaks in the marinade, cover and leave in the fridge for at least 1 hour.Meanwhile, to make the aioli, blend the garlic and a little oil with a pinch of salt in a food processor. Add the yolks and blend until the mixture becomes slightly pale. Add the remaining oil, a little at a time, whilst blending, until it thickens. Add the smoked paprika and mix.To make the tomatoes, lay the tomatoes on a baking tray, sprinkle with the sugar and a pinch of salt, then drizzle with the oil. Bake for 5â€“10 minutes, or until juicy.To serve, remove the steaks from the marinade and cut them into 3cm/1in-thick slices. Divide between four places, dress with a drizzle of the marinade and season. Serve with the roast tomatoes and aioli.
