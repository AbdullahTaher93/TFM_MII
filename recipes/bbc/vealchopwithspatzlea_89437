Place in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through.For the spätzle, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil.Blend all the spätzle ingredients, except the butter and olive oil, in a food processor to form a dough.

Repeat with the rest of the mixture.Carefully drop the spätzle into the boiling water and cook for 1-1½ minutes.
