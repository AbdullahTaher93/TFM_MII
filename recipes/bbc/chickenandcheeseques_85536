Carefully place a quesadilla into the frying pan and cook over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes, until crisp and golden and the cheese filling is melting. Carefully turn the quesadilla over and cook on the other side for a further two minutes, or until crisp and golden. Remove from the pan and set aside to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining quesadillas.Cut the quesadillas into quarters and serve fresh and hot.For the salsa, place all of the salsa ingredients into a food processor and pulse to combine.
