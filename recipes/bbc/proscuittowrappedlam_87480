Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Spread one teaspoon of quince paste over both sides of each set of lamb cutlets and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Wrap each cutlet with two slices of prosciutto and brush with a little olive oil.Heat a large non-stick frying pan until hot then add the wrapped lamb (you may need to cook these in batches). Cook the lamb for 30-40 seconds each side, or until the prosciutto is golden-brown all over, then remove from the pan and set aside.Place the green beans and butter beans into a 35cm/14in x 22cm/9in ceramic baking dish.Pour over the stock and wine and sprinkle with small knobs of the butter.Place the lamb on top of the beans and transfer to the oven to roast for ten minutes (medium rare), or until lamb is cooked to your liking.For the parsnips, use a vegetable peeler to peel the parsnips into long thin strips or ribbons.Place the parsnip ribbons into a baking tray lined with non-stick baking parchment and sprinkle with the butter, sugar and salt.Transfer to the oven to roast for 10-12 minutes, then remove and gently stir the parsnip ribbons to separate the ribbons as much as possible. Return to the oven and roast for a further 8-10 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.To serve, place a spoonful of the bean mixture onto each plate and place a prosciutto-wrapped lamb cutlet onto each pile of beans. Place a handful of crisp parsnip ribbons alongside.
