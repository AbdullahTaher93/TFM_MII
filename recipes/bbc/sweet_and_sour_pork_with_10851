For the pork, heat a deep fat fryer to 190C/375F, or alternatively heat vegetable oil in a deep-sided, heavy based pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Toss the pork strips with the vegetable oil.Place the salt and rice/potato flour into a bowl, add the pork and toss to coat each piece thoroughly.Lower the pork pieces carefully into the fat fryer a few at a time, and cook, in batches, for 2 minutes. Remove the pork pieces from the hot oil, and drain onto kitchen paper.For the sauce, heat a frying pan until hot, add the sugar and heat til it becomes a caramel, then carefully add the rice wine, grapefruit juice and soy sauce and bring to the boil. Add the chopped chillies, chilli flakes and ginger and cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens a little.Heat a wok until hot, add the vegetable oil, onion, peppers and pineapple and stir fry for 3-4 minutes until just tender. Add the garlic and cooked pork to the sauce and cook for 1-2 minutes, tossing the pork so it gets a good covering of the sauce.For the egg fried rice, heat a wok until hot, add the oil and rice and stir fry for 2-3 minutes until hot through. Mix the eggs and sesame oil in a bowl with a fork. Add the eggs to the rice and continue to stir-fry for 2-3 minutes or until the eggs have set and the mixture is dry.Place the cabbage in the deep fat fryer for 2 minutes, drain and sprinkle with the salt and sugar and toss.Pile the fried rice onto a plate and spoon the pork alongside, spooning extra sauce over the top. Serve the crispy cabbage on top of the pork, with the grated scallop.
