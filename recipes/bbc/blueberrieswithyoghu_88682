For the blueberries with yoghurt, place the blueberries into the base of a tall glass, spoon in the yoghurt and drizzle over the honey.For the blueberry coulis, place all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth.Swirl some of the coulis into the yoghurt and honey.For the caramelised almonds, place the sugar into a small frying pan and heat gently. When it starts to melt, tip in the almonds and cook for 4-5 minutes, until they start to turn golden-brown and the sugar caramelises. Pour onto a sheet of silicone paper or greaseproof paper to cool.When cool enough to handle, break into pieces and garnish the top of the yoghurt, honey and coulis with pieces of the caramelised almonds.
