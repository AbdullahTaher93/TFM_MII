Whisk in the sugar a little at a time until thick and gleaming.By hand, fold in the cornflour, vinegar and cardamom, then add the chocolate chips and most of the pistachios and very gently fold these in too.With a spoon, drop mounded blobs of the mixture, 4â€“5cm/2in in diameter, onto the prepared tray. Sprinkle with the remaining pistachios.Put the cookies into the oven, shut the door and turn off the oven immediately. Let the cookies sit in the turned-off oven overnight.
