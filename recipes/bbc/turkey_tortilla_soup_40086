First prepare the tomatoes. Heat a heavy-based frying pan until hot, then add the tomatoes, garlic and dried chillies. Dry fry, shaking the pan regularly until the tomatoes are starting to blacken.Remove the chilli when it starts to smell aromatic and put it in a bowl. Pour over some freshly boiled water and leave to soften.Tip the tomatoes into a food processor or blender. Peel the garlic cloves and add these too, then drain the chilli from its soaking water and add this. Blend until smooth.While you are dry roasting the tomatoes, heat the olive oil in a large casserole or saucepan. Add the onions, pepper and celery. Fry on a medium heat until starting to caramelise around the edges â€“ this should take between 10-15 minutes.Add the cumin, thyme, bay leaves and oregano. Finely chop the coriander stems and add these too.Add the stock and reserved tomato mixture to the saucepan, along with the black beans and sweetcorn. Season well with salt and pepper, then bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes.Add the cooked turkey to the soup and leave to simmer while you prepare the garnishes.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.
