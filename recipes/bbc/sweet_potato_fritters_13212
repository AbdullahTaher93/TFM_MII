Heat the oil in a small frying pan. Add the onion and cook until soft, translucent and starting to caramelise. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to cool down.Put the flour into a bowl and add the baking powder, Cajun seasoning, lemon zest and plenty of salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly. Break in the egg and mix until you have a thick, roux-like paste, then stir in the cream to loosen the batter. Add the onion, garlic, sweet potato and parsley if using.Use a scant amount of olive oil to coat the base of a large frying pan. Put heaped tablespoons of the batter onto the frying pan, smoothing out into flat rounds as you go. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until crisp and brown.Remove from the pan and continue until you have used up all the batter. Drain onto kitchen towel and keep warm before serving.
