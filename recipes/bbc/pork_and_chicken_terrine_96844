Slice the chicken breasts into strips. Place in a bowl, season with salt and pepper and add the white wine, lemon zest and thyme leaves, then drizzle over the olive oil. Cover and leave to marinate for at least an hour.For the pork layer, finely chop the pork shoulder and pork belly, or put the whole lot through a meat grinder, or blend in a food processor. Put into a bowl with the lemon zest, thyme leaves, ground ginger, apricots and pistachios and mix well. Season with salt and pepper.Preheat the oven to 150C/130C Fan/Gas 2. Stretch the bacon rashers with the back of the knife. Line a 1 litre/1¾ pint terrine mould with the rashers, widthways, arranging them on alternative diagonals so that they overlap by slightly criss-crossing one another. You should have around 5cm/2in overlap on each side – if you don’t you may need to stretch the bacon out a little more.Put half of the pork mixture into the terrine and spread it evenly. Remove the chicken from the marinade and mix with the finely chopped parsley in a bowl, then lay the strips out in an even layer. Finally, cover with the remaining pork mixture.Cover the top of the terrine with the overhanging bacon slices, continuing with the criss-crossing, then top with more slices so that it is completely covered.Put the lid on the terrine or cover with a double layer of foil. Put in a roasting tin and add just enough boiled water to reach up to 2cm/¾in up the side of the terrine. Put in the oven and bake for 1½  hours.To check if the terrine is cooked through, check it has reached 75C (using a meat probe or thermometer) or just hold a skewer in the centre for a few seconds – if the tip is too hot to hold for more than a second, it is done.Recover the terrine with a couple of layers of foil, then weigh down with either a couple of tins or something similarly heavy. Leave to cool, then leave to chill overnight in the fridge.To serve, turn the terrine out and cut into thick slices.
