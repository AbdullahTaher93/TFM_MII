For the Russian dressing, mix together all the ingredients and season with salt and pepper.Butter both slices of bread. Put the salt beef on one slice, then top with the cheese and sauerkraut. Spread the Russian dressing over the other slice and place it on top of the sauerkraut.Heat the sandwich in a sandwich maker or in a hot, dry frying pan. (If using a frying pan, butter both sides of the bread, press the sandwich down onto the pan with a spatula, and heat for 3â€“4 minutes on each side until the bread is well browned and the cheese has melted.) Serve with dill pickles.
