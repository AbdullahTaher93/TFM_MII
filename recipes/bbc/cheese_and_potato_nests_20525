Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and brush a six-hole muffin tin with the soft butter.Peel the potatoes and use the julienne blade on a mandoline to make thin matchsticks (or slice by hand).Put the onion, garlic, bay leaf and lardons into a large non-stick frying pan and cook until the lardons are golden-brown. Add the wine and reduce until only a couple of tablespoons of liquid remain. Remove the bay leaf.Stir in the potato matchsticks and take off the heat, then stir in the Reblochon cubes.Divide the potato mix between the six holes in the muffin tin and bake for 15â€“20 minutes or until golden-brown and bubbling. Serve hot.
