Mix the zaâ€™atar with the olive oil in a small bowl to create a paste. Smear this paste over the cod pieces, ensuring they are well coated. Season each piece of fish with a pinch of salt. Place in a non-reactive container and leave to marinade in the fridge for 30 minutes.For the relish, place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

The cod should be golden-brown with a nice spice crusting.Serve the cod with a generous helping of the relish.
