Cook the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water for 15–20 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and mash or push through a ricer..Pour the double cream into a small frying or sauté pan and bring to a simmer over a medium–low heat. Add the smoked haddock and poach for 5–6 minutes, or until just cooked. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon, peel off the skin and put it in the cream. Cook until the cream is almost toffee-like, then remove from the heat and discard the skin.In a clean, glass bowl, whisk one (30g/1oz) egg white until stiff peaks form.Break the haddock into a mixer or food processor with a paddle attachment and mix until flaked. Add the mashed potato, béchamel and lemon zest and season with salt and pepper. Continue mixing until everything is just combined.Fold the beaten egg white into the fish mixture.Using two tablespoons, quenelle the fish mixture and place on a baking tray. Cover and put in the fridge until they firm up.Put the rice flour, remaining egg whites and breadcrumbs in separate shallow bowls. Dip each quenelle first in the flour, then in the egg whites, then in the breadcrumbs, before returning it to the tray.Heat the oil in a deep-frying pan or deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous, do not leave unattended.) Deep-fry the quenelles for 4–5 minutes, or until golden brown, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.For the salad, put the leaves in a salad bowl. Put the vinegar and oil in a jar and shake well. Pour the vinaigrette over the leaves and toss. Add the dill just before serving.To serve, spoon the sauce onto four plates, put the rissoles to one side and put the salad next to them.
