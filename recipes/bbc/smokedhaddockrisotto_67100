In a large pan over a medium heat sweat the shallots, then add the bay leaf, thyme and curry powder and stir.Add the rice and stir well to coat the crains with the mixture.Gradually add fish stock to the rice using a ladle, stirring constantly, adding another ladleful of stock when the rice has absorbed the last batch of liquid. This will take about 15 minutes until all the stock is used up. It is very important that the stock isn't added all at once.When the last ladleful has been absorbed, add the peas and stir them in.Meanwhile, place the haddock into the simmering milk and poach for about 1-2 minutes depending on how thick the fillets are. Once the fish is poached, discard the skin and flake it into the risotto.Meanwhile fry the pancetta until very crispy and keep warm until you are ready to serve.Add the butter, parsley and marscarpone to the risotto and fold everything together.Spoon the risotto onto the centre of a plate, rest the crispy pancetta against the risotto and place a poached egg on top.
