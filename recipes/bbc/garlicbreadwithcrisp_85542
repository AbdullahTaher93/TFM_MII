For the garlic bread, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and lay the parma ham on a baking tray.Place the ham in the oven and roast for eight minutes until crisp.Allow the ham to cool - it will harden slightly.Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan and add the garlic. Add the croissant halves to the pan and fry until a deeper golden-brown on both sides.For the poached eggs, bring a small saucepan of water and the vinegar to a simmer over a medium heat.Carefully crack the eggs into two small ramekins, being careful not to break the yolks.Gently add the eggs to the water. Turn down the heat and place a lid on the pan.Cook the eggs for two minutes until the white is firm.Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and press the base of the spoon against a sheet of kitchen paper to drain.To serve, place the ham and fried croissant on a plate and arrange the egg on top. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
