For the prawn toast, pulse the prawns in a food processor with the hazelnut oil, egg whites, nutmeg, salt and pepper until smooth. Spread the mixture evenly on the bread slices.Heat a frying pan and add the vegetable oil. Once hot, shallow fry the toast until golden-brown on both sides, fry the prawn side first. Drain on kitchen paper.For the pesto, put all the ingredients, except the olive oil, in a blender. Add half the oil and pulse, adding more oil until the pesto has a smooth consistency (you may not need all the oil).To serve, put the chicory leaves in a large bowl. Mix the oil and lemon juice in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the leaves and toss to coat the leaves.Trim and cut the toast into bite-size pieces and serve warm with the pesto and dressed chicory leaves.
