For the mojo verde, put the coriander, parsley, spring onion, garlic, 170ml/5½fl oz olive oil, white wine vinegar, cayenne, cumin, salt and pepper in a food processor and pulse to a coarse paste. Set aside.Bring a large pan of water to boil. Add the octopus, onion and  bay leaf and simmer until tender. (This takes about 20 minutes per kilo. If a tooth pick slides through a tentacle easily, then the octopus is cooked). Once cooked, separate the octopus legs from the body by cutting at the join and then cut each leg into pieces.Heat a dash of oil in a pan set over a medium heat. Add the octopus and fry for 2–3 minutes.Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and add the new potatoes. Boil for 10 minutes or until cooked through. Drain and leave to cool enough to handle. Cut into halves.Heat a frying pan with the remaining 80ml/2¾fl oz olive oil. Add the potato halves and shallots, season and fry until golden brown.Heat a pan until hot. Dry fry the txistorra until the skin looks golden and crispy.Preheat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the sliced artichokes into the fryer and cook for 1–2 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.To serve, spread the mojo verde evenly onto a plate and place a mixture of the octopus, potatoes and txistorra on top. Drizzle with a little olive oil and garnish with the artichokes.
