To make the bisque, heat the oil in a large saucepan and cook the carrot, onion, celery and leek over a low heat for 5–7 minutes. Add the pepper, tomatoes, fennel, bay leaf, peppercorns, thyme and coriander seeds.Crush the crab and langoustine shells and add to the pan with the tomato purée and rice. Add the brandy and flambé. (CAUTION: Keep your face and hair away from the flames. Do not leave unattended.)Pour over the stock and simmer for 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and pass through a fine sieve into a clean pan. Simmer until the volume of the liquid has reduced by two thirds and the bisque is thick.Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 175C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.To make the wontons, mix the crab meat with the chilli, chives and lime juice.Egg wash the edges of each wonton wrapper. Divide the crab mixture between each wonton and seal.Deep-fry the wontons for 5 minutes until golden-brown. Drain the wontons on kitchen paper and serve alongside the bisque in bowls topped with a spoonful of crème fraîche.
