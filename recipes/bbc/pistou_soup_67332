Add the onions and garlic and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent.Add the thyme, bay leaves, tomato pur√©e, carrots and courgettes, then cook for 15-20 minutes or until the vegetables are al dente (tender but still a little crunchy).Add the green beans with the boiling water and bring to a boil, then add the pasta. Cook for 10 minutes or until the pasta is al dente.Add the white beans and peas. Remove the sprig of thyme and the bay leaves, then add the salt, sugar and pepper to taste.Serve immediately in bowls, with a dollop of Vietnamese pistou on top of the soup.
