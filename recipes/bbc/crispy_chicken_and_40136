Soak the noodles in warm water for about 15 minutes, or until soft. Drain in a colander and cut them into thirds. Squeeze out any excess moisture in a clean tea towel.Meanwhile, mix the chicken with some salt and pepper, the olive oil, spring onions, chives, coriander and sun-dried tomatoes in a bowl. Add the noodles and mix well.Make a paste by mixing the flour and water together.When you are ready to make the rolls, fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip a rice paper wrapper in the water and let it soften for 1 minute. Remove and drain on a clean tea towel.Place a large spoonful of the filling in the middle of the wrapper and roll the bottom edge over the filling, fold up both sides of the rice paper, and continue to roll to the end. Seal the end with a little of the flour paste mixture. The roll should be compact and tight, about 7.5cm/3in. Place on a clean plate and continue the process until you have used up all the filling.Heat the oil in a wok or large frying-pan over a high heat to smoking point. Turn the heat down to medium and deep-fry the rolls a few at a time, until they are golden-brown. They have a tendency to stick to each other, so only fry a few at a time. Do not attempt to break them apart if they stick together, you can do this after they have been removed from the oil. Drain each batch on kitchen paper.Serve with iceberg lettuce cups, fresh basil and coriander sprigs.
