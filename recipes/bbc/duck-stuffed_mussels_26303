To make the flatbreads, place the flour, salt and coriander seeds into a large mixing bowl and gradually add water to form a dough.Roll the dough out onto a floured surface and shape into rounds.Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the flatbreads to the pan and cook on each side for 2–3 minutes. Keep warm.Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the mussels and wine, cover and cook for 2–3 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.Once the mussels have opened, strain, reserving the cooking liquor. Discard any mussels that haven’t fully opened.Once the mussels are cool enough to handle, remove them from their shells, reserving half of the shells.Place the fresh coriander into a small food processor with a little of the cooking liquor and blend until smooth.Preheat the grill to high.Lay the mussel shells on a grill tray and spoon a little of the coriander purée into each shell and top with the cooked mussel meat.In a bowl, mix the chopped duck with the breadcrumbs.Sprinkle the breadcrumb mix over the mussels and place under the grill for 3–5 minutes.Brush the flatbreads with the melted butter and serve with the mussels.
