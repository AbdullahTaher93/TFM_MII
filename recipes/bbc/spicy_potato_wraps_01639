For the tortillas, in a mixing bowl combine all the ingredients along with 150g/5fl oz cold water to form a smooth dough. Knead the dough for 1-2 minutes. (Don’t work it for a more than a minute or two as it’s easier to roll out with less kneading at this stage.)Once the dough is smooth, cover the bowl with cling film and leave to rest for five minutes.Place a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat.Break the dough into golf-ball sized pieces and dust with a little extra flour, then roll out into rounds about the thickness of a 5p piece.Place a dough round in the hot, dry pan and wait until it starts to puff up before turning it over and cooking for the same time on the other side.Again, they will puff up. Press them down with a spatula and cook until they are browned in spots and cooked through. Remove from the pan and place on a plate. Repeat the process until you have used all the dough.You can stack the tortillas on top of each other on the plate; they won’t stick together.For the spicy potatoes, in a dry pan, toast your whole spices, heating them gently until they begin to release their aroma.Remove from the heat and lightly crush them in a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder. Once ground down to a coarse mixture, add the smoked paprika and a little salt.Heat a frying pan big enough to hold all your potato, add the oil and begin frying the potato pieces.Once they start to brown, add the spice mix, chopped chilli (as much or as little as you like), onion and garlic and cook for a few minutes until the onion softens; you may need to add a little more oil.Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and roughly chop the mint and coriander.Squeeze the lime over the potatoes and remove the pan from the heat.To serve put the potatoes onto the tortillas and top with herbs. Sprinkle with grated cheese, yoghurt and salad leaves.
