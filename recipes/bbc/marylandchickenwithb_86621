Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.For the Maryland chicken, combine the breadcrumbs and chilli flakes in a bowl and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Season the chicken and dip into the beaten egg, then the breadcrumb mixture, to coat all over.Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken for about 12 minutes over a medium heat, turning frequently, until crisp and golden-brown.Dot the chicken breasts with butter, place onto a baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake for ten minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through.For the cornbread, place the flour, polenta, sugar and baking powder into a bowl and mix well. Place a deep, ovenproof dish into the oven.Make a well in the centre of the dry mixture and add the beaten egg and the milk. Mix well, then add the melted butter.Pour the mixture into the hot ovenproof dish, transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until golden-brown.For the banana fritters, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Place the flour and sugar into a bowl and add enough water to make a smooth batter. Dip the banana pieces into the batter to coat.Carefully place the bananas into the hot oil and deep fry for 4-5 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.To serve, place the Maryland chicken, cornbread and banana fritters onto a large platter.
