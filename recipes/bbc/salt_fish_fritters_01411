Drain the soaked salt cod and cook in boiling water for 20-25 minutes, or until the fish is flaky and tender.  Drain the salt cod and flake the flesh, removing the skin and pin bones.Tip the flour into a bowl and stir in enough cold water to make a thick paste (about 250ml/9fl oz). Stir in the salt cod, red and green peppers, onions, scotch bonnet pepper and season with freshly ground black pepper.Heat  2.5cm/1in vegetable oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Carefully place spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the fritters are crisp and golden-brown (you may need to do this in batches). Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper to remove any excess oil.
