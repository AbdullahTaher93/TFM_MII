For the bone gravy, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Dry the turbot bones thoroughly and place on a roasting tray. Roast the bones in the oven for 15–20 minutes. Keep the oven on.In a heavy-based saucepan, add the white wine and vermouth and reduce to a glaze. Add the chicken stock, roasted bones and lime leaves and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain the liquid and then stir in the butter. Keep warm.Meanwhile for the cauliflower, heat the oil in a large ovenproof casserole and, once the pan is smoking, add half of the cauliflower pieces with the cut side down. Cook until brown and then turn to brown the other side. Add the butter, vadouvan spice and lime leaves.Put the remaining cauliflower in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil and cook for 10-15 minute, or until the cauliflower is tender. Drain and blitz in a food processor until smooth. Season.As the butter browns, spoon it over the cauliflower. Place the casserole in the oven and roast for 10 minutes, or until just soft. Squeeze the lime juice over the cauliflower and sprinkle with lime zest and the finger lime flesh. Season with salt.For the turbot, heat the fat or oil in a frying pan and, once the pan is lightly smoking, add the fish. Season the fish in the pan with salt and pepper and reduce to a medium heat immediately. Cook for 2 minutes, reduce to a low heat and add the butter without turning the fish. Spoon the butter over the back of the fish for a further 2 minutes. Turn the fish over and allow to rest in the melted butter for 2 more minutes.For the yogurt, place the yogurt in a small bowl and stir in the lime juice. Season with salt.Place a spoonful of the yoghurt and purée onto the plate and top with the roasted cauliflower. Cut the fish in half and lay on the plate topped with the lardo, if using.
