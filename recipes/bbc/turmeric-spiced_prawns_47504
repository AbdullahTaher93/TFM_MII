For the prawns, place all the ingredients except the prawns into a bowl and mix well to combine. Add the prawns, mix gently then place in the fridge to marinate for at least four hours.For the omelette pilau, heat a saucepan until hot, add half the oil, the onion, garlic and spices, and fry for two minutes.Stir in the rice and add the chicken stock. Bring to the boil, cover and reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook for 18-20 minutes until the rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed. Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper and the lemon juice, then stir in the coriander leaves and set aside until cool enough to handle.Heat a large frying pan until smoking hot, add half the remaining oil and half the beaten eggs and swirl around the pan until the eggs are just cooked.Scatter half the pilau rice over the omelette then slide out of the frying pan onto a chopping board. Roll the omelette up into a pinwheel and set aside.Repeat with the remaining oil, eggs and rice.Meanwhile, remove the prawns from the fridge, return to room temperature then thread onto wooden skewers.Heat a griddle pan or indoor barbecue until very hot, add the prawns and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side or until just cooked through.Remove the skewers from the pan and rest for a couple of minutes.To serve, lay the skewers of prawns onto serving plates. Cut the omelette pinwheel into thick slices and lay alongside the prawns. Garnish with a sprig of coriander and serve immediately.
