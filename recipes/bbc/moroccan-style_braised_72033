Add the pork and its marinade, stock, bay leaf and apricots and braise very gently over a low heat for 2–3 hours, or until very tender.For the couscous, place the couscous in a large bowl with the cinnamon stick. Cover with boiling  water, place a plate over the bowl and leave for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the vinegar, sugar and oil together in a small bowl. Fork the vinegar mixture though the cooked couscous. Stir in the chopped herbs, orange and lemon zests, raisins, almonds and pistachios and season with salt and pepper.Cut the pork slices into four portions and place on warmed plates.
