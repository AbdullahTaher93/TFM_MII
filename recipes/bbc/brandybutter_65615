Put the butter in a bowl. Beat well with a wooden spoon till soft or for speed use an electric hand whisk (and if you use a food processor then there is no need to sieve the icing sugar).Beat in both the sugars till smooth, then add the brandy. If you are over generous with the brandy it will curdle so just beat in more sieved icing sugar and it will come smooth again.Serve with the Christmas pudding or even as a cheeky addition to a mince pie.
