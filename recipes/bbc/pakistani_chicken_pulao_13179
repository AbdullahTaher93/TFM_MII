To make the chicken stock, put all the ingredients in a large saucepan with 2 pints of water, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes, skimming off any foam. Turn off the heat, remove the chicken and set aside. Strain the stock and discard all the remaining solids.Heat the oil in a saucepan and add the cumin. When they begin to pop and turn brown, add the onions, ginger, garlic and chilli. Cook until the onions are brown, but be careful not to burn them. Turn down the heat, then add a ladleful of chicken stock and cover the pan (be careful as it will splutter). Cook for 3–4 minutes. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown.Stir in the yoghurt and cook for 4–5 minutes, or until all the water has evaporated, stirring all the time.Add the rice and another 250ml/9fl oz stock (or just enough to cover the rice). If you run out of stock, use water. Any leftover stock can be frozen.Adjust the seasoning, cover and turn the heat to its lowest setting. Cook for 10–15 minutes, but keep checking. It’s done when all the liquid has be absorbed and the rice stands on end but is not soggy. Take the lid off and fluff up the rice with a fork. Turn off the heat and serve immediately with raita and salad.
