Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.In a saucepan, melt the butter with the caster sugar and golden syrup.Remove from the heat and gently fold in the flour and ginger with the lime juice and zest.Leave to cool down completely.Drop large tablespoons of the mixture onto a heavy-based baking sheet. Make sure that you keep the mixture well spaced as it will spread out when cooking.Cook for about five minutes until the brandy snaps are golden and lacy. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for a couple of minutes on the tray, then carefully remove using a palette knife. Lift each one gently on to a wooden spoon, then roll round the handle to form a tube.Allow to cool on a wire rack.Meanwhile, whip the cream in a bowl until you have achieved soft peaks, then fold in the chilli powder, passion fruit pulp and icing sugar.Scoop into a piping bag and leave in the fridge until you are ready to serve.To serve, pipe each snap with the chilli and passion fruit cream and then place three onto each serving plate.Serve immediately.
