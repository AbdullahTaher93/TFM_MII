For the carrots, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Place the carrots in a roasting tin and drizzle with the olive oil. Add the thyme, rosemary and garlic to the tin and toss to combine. Sprinkle over the salt and cover everything with the coffee beans.Cover the tin with kitchen foil and roast in the oven for 15 minutes. The carrots need to be cooked until they are completely tender. Check with a knife to see how tender the carrots are and give them another 10–15 minutes if needed.Meanwhile, put the beetroot into another ovenproof dish, toss with the honey, garlic, salt and herbs then cover with foil and roast for 15 minutes.Pour the carrot juice into a saucepan and cook until reduced by half. Add a drop of honey if it needs more sweetness.Remove the carrots from the roasting tin and cut into pieces. Heat the butter in a frying pan and cook the carrots for 3–5 minutes, or until starting to colour.Serve the carrots with the burrata, honeyed beetroot and flowers and drizzle with the carrot juice to finish.
