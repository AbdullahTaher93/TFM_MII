Tip the basmati rice into a large bowl and cover with cold water. Set aside.Heat the oil in a large lidded sautè pan, add the chicken thighs and fry on each side for 1–2 minutes, or until just golden brown. Push the chicken to one side, add the onion and cook for 3–4 minutes, or until just softened but not coloured.Stir the chicken back into the onions, then add the garlic, ginger, chilli and smoked paprika and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato purèe and mix well.Drain the rice and stir it into the chicken mixture. Add the tomato passata and half the stock. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and cook gently over a medium-low heat for 15 minutes, or until the liquid has nearly been absorbed.Stir the rice well, then add the remaining stock and stir once more. Scatter the peppers over the top of the rice, return the lid to the pan and cook for another 5 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice and peppers are tender. (If the rice is not quite done, cook for a further 5 minutes.) Season with pepper, stir through in the coriander and serve.
