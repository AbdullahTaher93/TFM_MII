Remove from the blender and leave to one side.Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a pan and seal the chicken breasts for a few minutes on each side to colour the flesh.Place the chicken breasts on an oven tray and top each with a thick coating of the polenta mixture.Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes to cook the chicken through and allow the topping to go crunchy.Place the chicken breasts on a plate and serve with a dollop of the rocket pesto on the side.
