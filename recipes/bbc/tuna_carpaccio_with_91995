For the tuna carpaccio, place the tuna slices on a work surface between two sheets of cling film. Flatten the tuna as much as possible by hitting with a rolling pin. Drizzle the tuna slices with the lemon juice and olive oil and season with salt. Set the tuna slices aside in the fridge.For the raw artichoke salad, trim away the tough outer leaves of the artichokes until you get to the pale green centre. Cut in half and remove the inedible centre (known as the choke) and any purple leaves around this. Thinly slice the remaining leaves using a mandolin or sharp knife. Place the sliced artichoke in a salad bowl with the celery, mint, rocket, oil and lemon juice and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.For the deep-fried artichokes, preheat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Cut the top off the artichoke, trim away the tough outer leaves and remove the choke from the centre. Gently spread the remaining pale green leaves out in a flower shape. Roll the artichoke in the two flours then carefully lower the artichokes into the deep-fat fryer and cook until crisp and golden-brown. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain and season with salt and pepper.Divide the tuna slices between two plates and scatter the raw artichoke salad over the top. Garnish with the deep-fried artichoke leaves and finish with the Parmesan. Drizzle over the lemon juice and olive oil and serve.
