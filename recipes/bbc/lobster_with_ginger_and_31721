Freeze the lobsters for 2 hours prior to cooking. Working quickly, take the first lobster, cut off the head using a sharp knife, then immediately cut the tail down the centre. Remove the flesh from the shell. Repeat with the second lobster. Cut each one into 6–8 pieces. Reserve and clean the shell for serving.Heat a wok or sauté pan over a high heat. Add half the sesame oil. Once hot, fry the lobster for 1 minute, then transfer it to a warm plate.Add the rest of the sesame oil to the pan. Fry the ginger, half the spring onions and the pak choi until softened. Return the lobster to the pan and stir in the remaining ingredients. Cover with a lid and simmer for 1 minute.Fill the shells with the meat. Divide between serving plates and garnish with the reserved spring onions.
