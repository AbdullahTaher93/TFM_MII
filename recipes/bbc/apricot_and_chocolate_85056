Line a 20cm/8in square cake tin with cling film, leaving plenty overhanging the sides.Put the nuts in a food processor and blitz until finely chopped, but not ground to a powder – you want them to add a lovely crunch. Tip them into a bowl.Put the apricots and dates in the food processor and blend to a thick paste, but don’t let it get too smooth.Return the nuts to the food processor and add the coconut oil, cocoa powder and seeds. Blend until the mixture comes together. You may need to remove the lid and push the mixture down a couple of times with a spatula.Spread the paste over the base of the tin and smooth the surface. Bring the excess cling film up and over the mixture to cover completely. Put in the freezer for 30–60 minutes, or until solid.Take the tray out of the freezer, unwrap and place on a board. Cut into 16 squares, and transfer to a lidded container. Interleave with sheets of baking paper so the bars don’t stick together and keep in the fridge.
