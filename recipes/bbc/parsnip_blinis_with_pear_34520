Measure the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and break the eggs into the middle. Whisk, adding the milk to make a smooth batter. Add the parsnips and mix again.Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add a small teaspoon of the mixture to the pan to make small round blinis. Fry for a few minutes, once bubbles appear turn over and cook on the other side until lightly golden and the blinis are cooked through. Cool a rack while you continue with the remaining mixture.When ready to serve, Spoon a little cranberry sauce on top of the blinis. Top with pear and walnut pieces and a little cheese.
