Season the chicken generously with pepper.Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil a large, non-stick frying pan. Fry the chicken over a medium–high heat for 4–5 minutes, turning occasionally. Set aside.Place the remaining oil, butter and onions in a large, non-stick saucepan and cook over a medium heat for 8–10 minutes, or until the onions are well softened and lightly browned. Stir in the garlic, ginger, curry powder and turmeric and cook for a few seconds more, stirring constantly.Add the mango chutney, lentils and stock to the spiced onions and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring regularly, for 15–20 minutes, or until the lentils are very soft. For an extra smooth sauce, blend using a stick blender.Add the chicken and 2 tablespoons of cream to the lentil mixture and simmer gently for 5–6 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Add an extra splash of water if the sauce is too thick.Meanwhile, place the rice in a saucepan of boiling water and cook for 10–12 minutes, or according to the packet instructions. Drain and set aside. Serve the curry immediately, garnished with the remaining cream, with the freshly cooked rice.
