Soak two wooden skewers in cold water for 10-15 minutes, then drain and set aside.For the skewers, mix the chilli powder, ground turmeric and curry powder together in a bowl with the cream until well combined.Thread the chicken strips onto the skewers, alternating the chicken with the green pepper, then rub with the creamy spice mixture.Heat a chargrill pan until smoking and griddle the skewers for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and the chicken is cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.)For the salsa, combine all of the salsa ingredients together in a small bowl.Serve the chicken skewers alongside a bowl of the salsa for dipping.
