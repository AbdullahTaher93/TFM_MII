Season the lamb liberally with sea salt. Heat a large frying pan and brown the meat all over (the lamb fat and the salt make a wonderful salty crust).Preheat the oven to 170C/330F/Gas 3.Break up the wet garlic into individual cloves (leave the skin on). Gently fry the garlic in olive oil, then add the tomatoes, cumin and stock. Season with salt and pepper (remember there will be plenty of salt on the lamb already).Tip into a roasting tin and add the rosemary, cumin and paprika. Place the lamb on top.Cover with baking parchment and roast for 2-3 hours, or until the meat falls away from the bone.
