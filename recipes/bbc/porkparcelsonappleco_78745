Repeat this process to create two prepared filo bases.Place one slice of pork at one end of each filo base and top with the chilli flakes and tarragon.Sprinkle both with brown sugar and dried apricot pieces.Brush around the sides with the beaten egg and fold in the sides, then loosely roll up and seal with more of the beaten egg.Lay the parcels onto an oiled baking sheet. Brush all over with the beaten egg, sprinkle with sesame seeds and place in the oven for 10-12 minutes or until cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside.For the compote, place the apple and sugar in a pan with a splash of water. Heat to a simmer and gently cook for seven minutes, or until soft. Remove from the heat and mash with a potato masher. Return to a gentle heat and drizzle with honey.To serve, place the compote into a warm dish and top with the pork parcels, garnished with chives and a drizzle of sesame oil.
