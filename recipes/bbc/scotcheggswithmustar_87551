For the scotch eggs, bring a saucepan of water to the boil. Add the four small eggs and boil for five minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs from the saucepan and place into a bowl of iced water.Place the quails' eggs into the pan and boil for three minutes, then place into the bowl of iced water. Peel the shells off all the eggs.Place the sausagemeat into a bowl and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Take a piece of sausagemeat in your hand and wrap it around one of the eggs, to a thickness of about 0.5cm/Â¼in. Repeat with the remaining sausagemeat and eggs.Dredge the sausagemeat-wrapped eggs in flour, then dip into the beaten eggs. Spread the breadcrumbs out on a plate and roll the wrapped eggs in the breadcrumbs. Repeat the process, dipping each wrapped egg again into the beaten egg and breadcrumbs until thoroughly coated.Preheat a deep fat fryer to 220C/425F, or place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Carefully place the eggs into the hot oil a few at a time and deep fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp on the outside. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.For the mustard, place all the mustard ingredients into a bowl and whisk to combine.To serve, pile the scotch eggs onto a plate with a bowl of the mustard alongside.
