Beat together the egg, milk and a generous amount of salt and pepper in a shallow bowl.Heat enough oil to just cover the bottom of a large frying pan over a medium heat. When the oil starts to shimmer, dip the bread into the egg mixture and add it to the pan. Cook for 5 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown.Serve with tomato ketchup or brown sauce.
