In a bowl, combine the lamb with the spices, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, pine nuts, parsley (reserve a tablespoon for serving), sugar, garlic, salt and pepper.Carefully cut the top off each pepper and scoop out the seeds. You might have to slice off the bottom horizontally so it can stand upright.Fill the peppers with the lamb mixture and put the top of the pepper back on. Pack the stuffed peppers into a flameproof casserole and pour over the vinegar and olive oil.Cover with a tight-fitting lid or foil and cook over medium to low heat for about 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Bake the peppers, uncovered, for 15â€“20 minutes or until caramelised and golden-brown.Serve with the pan juices spooned over and scatter with the reserved parsley and a pinch of cayenne-pepper.
