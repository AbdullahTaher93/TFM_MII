Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.In a large pan, melt 25g/1oz of the butter. Add the sugar and apples, then put the lid on and cook over a gentle heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.Remove the lid and cook for a further 5-10 minutes until the apples are broken down, but still with a few chunks for texture. Add the apricot jam and allow to cool.Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in a saucepan. Cut the slices of bread in half, and then in half again into strips, saving one piece for the base of the pudding basin and one for the lid. Dip each piece of bread into the melted butter and line a large pudding basin.Once the pudding basin is fully lined, spoon in the apple pur√©e and top with another round of bread that has been dipped in melted butter. Place in the oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown on top.Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Carefully turn out and serve immediately with custard.
