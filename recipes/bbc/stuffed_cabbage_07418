When the cabbage is cool, cut six of the leaves into large circles. Cut out six slightly smaller circles and another six smaller again.Mix the fried onions with all the remaining ingredients to make the stuffing. Season with salt and pepper.To stuff the cabbage, lay one of the largest cabbage circles on a board and spread with some of the stuffing mixture. Place the next size on top and repeat with the stuffing. Finally add a small circle and more stuffing. Gather the leaves into a ball and wrap in muslin securing the ball with string. Repeat with the remaining circles of cabbage.Add all the stock ingredients to a stock pot and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and add the cabbage.
