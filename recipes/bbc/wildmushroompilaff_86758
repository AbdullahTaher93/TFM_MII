Heat the oil in a large wide saucepan. Add the whole spices, cook for 20 seconds then add the onion and cashew nuts. Be careful as they may splater a bit. Fry for about 4-5 minutes, until the onions are soft and browning at the edges.Add the mushrooms, garlic and salt and sauté over a high heat for 4-5 minutes. Drain the rice that's been soaking and add to the pan along with the 390ml/13¾fl oz water, bring to the boil then cover and lower the heat to very low and cook for ten minutes.After ten minutes, check a grain of rice to see if it is tender. If not, leave for another minute. Take off the heat, remove the lid and allow any excess moisture to evaporate. Gently stir in the lemon juice, taste and adjust seasoning if necessary and stir gently with a fork.
