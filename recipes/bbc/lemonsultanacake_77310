Heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a 15cm/6in, loose-bottomed cake tin with greaseproof paper.Soften the coconut oil or margarine in a microwave and beat it with the mashed banana.Beat in the lemon rind and juice, then the oats.If you're using the eggs, stir them in with the potato or corn flour.If you're not using eggs, sieve the baking powder with the potato or cornflour and stir well into the mixture.Finally, stir in the sultanas and mix well.Spoon the mixture into the cake tin and bake for 30-35 minutes.Test with a skewer to make sure it's cooked (the skewer will come out clean when inserted into the middle) then allow to cool in the tin before removing.
