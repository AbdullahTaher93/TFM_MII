Bring the water to the boil over a high heat.Put the fish on a heatproof plate and scatter the ginger evenly over the top. Put the plate of fish into the steamer or on to the rack. Cover the pan tightly and gently steam the fish until it is just cooked. (Flat fish will take about five minutes to cook. Thicker fish or fillets will take 12-14 minutes.)Remove the plate of cooked fish and sprinkle on the spring onions and light and dark soy sauces.Heat the groundnut and sesame oils together in a small saucepan.When they are hot, add the garlic slices and brown them.Pour the garlic-oil mixture over the top of the fish and serve at once.For the stir-fried rice noodles with vegetables, soak the rice noodles in a bowl of warm water for 25 minutes. Then drain them in a colander or sieve.Trim the bean sprouts at both ends. Finely shred the chillies and the water chestnuts.Heat a wok or large frying pan until it is very hot. Add the oil and when it is very hot and slightly smoking, add the garlic, ginger and spring onions and stir-fry for 15 seconds.Then add the bean sprouts, shredded chillies and shredded water chestnuts and stir-fry for about one minute.Add the rest of the ingredients and the drained noodles and stir fry for about three minutes until it is well mixed and heated through.Serve at once.
