Add the oil, onion and garlic and pulse to a paste.Put the paste in a large bowl and mix with the mashed potato, herbs, pepper and egg. The mixture should be quite stiff. Shape the mixture into rugby-ball shapes and set aside, you can do this with your hands or using two dessertspoons to quenelle the mixture.Heat the sunflower oil in a large, heavy pan to 165C, using a temperature probe or sugar thermometer to check (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not over-fill the pan or leave unattended).Fry the fritters in small batches for 2–3 minutes, until rich golden-brown. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.
