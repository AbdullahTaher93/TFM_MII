Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Put the lamb mince in a large bowl. Add the onion and chilli.Pound the garlic and ginger in a pestle and mortar until you have a paste. Once smooth, add to the lamb and mix together to combine.Add the remaining ingredients and mix together to combine, using your hands, to ensure all the spices are mixed in well. Leave the mixture to rest for 30 minutes.

Place them on a baking tray lined with kitchen foil.Cook in the preheated oven for 15â€“20 minutes, turning the kebabs halfway during cooking.Meanwhile, for the mint sauce, place the chillies, mint, salt and pomegranate powder in a large pestle and mortar and grind together to make a rough paste.
