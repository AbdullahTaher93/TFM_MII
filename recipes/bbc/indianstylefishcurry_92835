In a lidded frying pan, heat the sunflower oil and fry the onion over a medium heat for 10 minutes until it is translucent and slightly browning at the edges. Add the garlic, ginger and chillies and fry for another few minutes until everything is softened.Add the halved cherry tomatoes, a splash of water, and put the lid on so that the tomatoes begin to soften and break down. Stir occasionally to prevent it sticking.Remove the lid, add the yellow pepper, salt and all the spices. Add another splash of water if itâ€™s looking very dry. Push the frozen mackerel fillet down into the sauce, cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Turn the fillet over and continue cooking, covered, for a further 5 minutes or until the mackerel fillet is cooked through and piping hot.Scatter with fresh coriander and serve with basmati rice.
