Place a large, lidded frying pan over a high heat. Add the oil, and as soon as it is warm, add the garlic. Reduce the heat and add the spring onions.Add the salt, tomato pur√©e and tomatoes and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened, adding 2 tablespoons of water if they start catching on the bottom of the pan.Add the cumin seeds and smoked paprika and cook for a few minutes.Add the spinach, a handful at a time, and mix as best as you can. Put the lid on the pan and allow the spinach to wilt. This will only take a few minutes.Take off the lid and cook for another few minutes on a medium heat until all the moisture has dried up.Make four cavities in the tomato mixture. Crack an egg into each cavity, then put the lid on and leave on the heat until the whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny. This should take about 4 minutes. Take off the lid and sprinkle over the chilli flakes.Spoon an egg and some of the smoky spinach onto each serving plate, and serve with yoghurt and toasted sourdough.
