Mix the venison with the ginger and garlic paste, turmeric, ground coriander, ground cumin, chilli powder, garam masala and a tablespoon of lemon juice in a large bowl. Cover and marinate in the fridge for 5–6 hours or more, if possible.Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a casserole dish over a medium heat. Add the venison when the oil is almost smoking then cook until browned on all sides.Remove from the heat, add the chopped chilli and coriander and check the seasoning. When cool enough to handle thread 4 pieces of venison onto each skewer until all the venison is used up.Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Place the flour in a bowl and beat the eggs with a pinch of salt in another. Roll each kebab in the flour, dip it in the egg and deep-fry until golden-brown. Drain on kitchen paper.To make the thoran, heat the oil in a frying pan and add the mustard and cumin seeds. Cook until they begin to pop, then add the curry leaves, ginger, chilli and asafoetida. Stir for a few seconds and add the onions and coconut, stirring, until the coconut gives off a nutty aroma.Add the Brussels sprouts, cover with a tight lid and cook for 1–2 minutes. Take off the lid and cook, for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry. Stir through the fresh coriander.Serve the kebabs with the Brussels sprout thoran.
