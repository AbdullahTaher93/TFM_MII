For the butternut squash, preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Place the butternut squash slices, shallots and rosemary on a lined baking tray. Drizzle with oil, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and roast for about 30–35 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through.In the meantime, to make the relish, put the red onion in a saucepan with a little oil and fry for 3–4 minutes before adding the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, dates, cranberries, 2 tablespoons of water, the sugar and lemon zest and juice (to taste). Simmer for about 6–8 minutes.When the butternut and shallots are cooked, arrange them on a serving platter and spoon over some of the relish. Crumble the feta cheese on top and garnish with chopped parsley.
