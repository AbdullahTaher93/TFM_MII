To make the pulled chicken, put the chicken legs and stock cube in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook on the lowest heat for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked  and the juices run clear. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside to cool.Meanwhile, to make the tomato sauce, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and fry the onion, garlic, oregano and chillies over a low heat for 5 minutes. Add the sugar and vinegar and cook for 1 minute, then add the passata and cook until the volume has reduced by half. Season to taste with salt. Blitz the sauce in a blender then pass through a sieve and keep warm.To make the salsa, mix together the tomatoes, chilli, shallot, garlic, lime juice, coriander and tequila and season with salt.Peel the skin off the cooled chicken legs and shred the meat discarding the bones. Mix the meat with the salsa and set aside.Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in one minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended. Deep-fry the tortillas for 30 seconds, or until golden and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.To serve, place two tortillas on each plate and top with some tomato sauce, some Little Gem and the chicken and salsa mixture. Spoon over some soured cream and a sprinkling of smoked paprika and serve.
