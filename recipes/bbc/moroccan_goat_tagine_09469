To make the tagine, mix together all the spices in a small bowl.Put the goat pieces in a large bowl, add half the spice mix and toss until the goat pieces are thoroughly coated.Cover and place in the fridge for 1â€“2 hours to allow the spices to permeate the meat.Meanwhile, to make the salad, soak the couscous in the chicken stock until plumped up and tender.Place the chickpeas in a bowl and roughly mash with a fork. Fold in the couscous with the red onion, pomegranate seeds, celery, mint and parsley.Whisk together the lemon juice and olive oil in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper.Fold the dressing into the salad, and leave at room temperature to allow the flavours to develop.Once the goat meat has marinated, place the apricots and sultanas in a bowl and cover with boiling water.Heat the oil in a large, high-sided frying pan over a high heat, add the goat pieces and fry until browned all over. Remove from the pan and set aside.Add the onions and garlic to the pan and fry for one minute over a low heat, then add the remaining spice mixture and fry until onions are soft. Add the apricots and sultanas and the soaking liquid, along with the honey, tomatoes and bouillon powder.Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes until the sauce has thickened and reduced.Add the goat pieces and toss until coated in the sauce, then half cover with a lid.Cook very gently for one and a half hours if using kid meat, and two hours and 45 minutes, if using goat, until the meat is cooked through and tender but still holding its shape.Leave to stand for 10 minutes, then scatter over the coriander and serve on plates with the couscous salad.
