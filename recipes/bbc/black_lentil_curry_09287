Thoroughly rinse the lentils in cold water and drain. Place in a pressure cooker and cover with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cover with the lid and turn on the pressure. Cook for 20 minutes, or until the lentils are very soft. Alternatively, place the rinsed lentils in a large, heavy-based saucepan and cover with cold water so that the level of the water is 5cm/2in above the top of the lentils. Bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer, cover loosely with a lid and cook for 1½–2 hours, topping up with water and stirring regularly. When the lentils are very soft and nearly all the water has been absorbed, remove from the heat and drain thoroughly.Put the onions in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan and add the onions. Fry for 8–10 minutes, or until softened and very lightly browned. Stir in the tomato purée and asafoetida. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring frequently, for 2–3 minutes, or until soft and pulpy.Blitz the grated ginger, garlic and chillies in a food processor until they form a paste.
