Using a vegetable peeler lightly peel the bottom inch to produce a white stalk and a green top. About 10 minutes before serving, bring a large pan of salted water to a rolling boil, drop in the asparagus and cook for 4–5 minutes. Drain immediately. Brush the melted butter over the asparagus and season with sea salt.For the trout, preheat a water bath to 50C.

Using a fork, mash in plenty of butter, season with salt and pepper and set aside until ready to use.To serve, remove the trout fillets from the water bath and cut open the vac pac bag.

Shape some potato into quenelles and place to the side. Top the trout with asparagus, drizzle with basil vinaigrette and serve immediately.
