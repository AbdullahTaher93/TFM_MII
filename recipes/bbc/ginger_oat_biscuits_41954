Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Line 3â€“4 baking trays with baking paper or silicone baking mats, or line 2 trays and cook in batches.Measure the butter, golden syrup and sugar into a large saucepan. Heat gently until the sugar is dissolved and everything is well combined.Remove from the heat and add the flour, semolina, oats and ginger. Stir until well incorporated, then tip onto a baking tray, flatten out and leave to cool for 10 minutes.Scoop up teaspoonfuls of the mixture (which will be quite crumbly and buttery) and roll into 36 little balls. Place on the prepared baking trays, well-spaced apart and push down slightly to flatten. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly golden-brown.Leave to cool on the baking trays, then store in an airtight container when completely cold.
