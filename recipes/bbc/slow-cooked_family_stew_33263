Season, to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Meanwhile for the polenta, cook the salt and polenta in 3 litres/5¼ pints boiling water, stirring continuously for 5-6 minutes (take care as the mixture may bubble and spit).Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cheeses and butter. Keep warm.To serve, spread the polenta on to a large, clean board, making a well in the middle, then pour the stew into the middle.
