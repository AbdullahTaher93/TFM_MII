Mix all the steak ingredients except the meat and oil together in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved.Place the steak in a sealable bag, add the marinade and gently massage it into the meat.

Add the sugar and stir until dissolved, then stir in the coriander, tamarind paste and red chilli.Half an hour before cooking, remove the steak from the bag and pat it dry with kitchen paper.Place a griddle pan over a high heat and carefully rub it with groundnut oil using kitchen paper. Cook the steak for 2 minutes on each side, then turn it and cook for another minute, or until browned. Remove it from the pan and leave it to rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a saucepan of boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain and set aside. Heat the sesame and groundnut oils in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the chilli and shrimps and cook for 3–4 minutes. Add the noodles, coriander and spring onions and stir in the soy sauce. Season with salt and ginger.To serve, place a twist of noodles on the plate. Slice the steak thinly and place it next to the noodles. Spoon some of the dressing over the noodles and serve.
