To make the marinade, mix together the lemongrass purée, lime juice and oil in a shallow dish. Add the seitan and toss well. Leave for 15 minutes.Preheat a lightly oiled griddle or large frying pan. Thread the marinated seitan pieces onto bamboo skewers and place on the griddle. (If cooking on a barbecue or under the grill, use metal skewers instead.) Cook for 4–5 minutes, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and hot through.To make the sauce, put the peanut butter, soy sauce, ginger and sriracha in a small saucepan. Add 5 tablespoons of water and cook over a low heat for about a minute, or until the peanut butter softens and the sauce thickens and becomes thick and glossy. Add a little extra sriracha if you like. (If making the satay with Quorn pieces, add an extra 2 teaspoons of soy sauce.)Serve with the cucumber, mint and sliced red chilli salad and lime wedges for squeezing over.
