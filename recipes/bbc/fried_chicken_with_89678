To make the fried chicken, put the chicken wings in a glass bowl and pour over the buttermilk. Coat well, cover with cling film and place in the fridge overnight.When you are ready to cook, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with the oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in 1 minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.Mix together the Sichuan pepper, salt, flour, paprika, chilli and five-spice in a bowl. Remove the chicken wings from the buttermilk and dip into the seasoned flour, coating each wing well. Carefully lower the wings into the fryer and deep-fry for 8–10 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm.To make the pancakes, put the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl, break in the eggs and whisk. Gradually whisk in the milk.Heat the oil in a medium frying pan and spoon the mixture into the pan to make pancakes about 10cm/4in in diameter. Cook for 2–3 minutes, until bubbles start to appear, then flip and cook for a further minute or until golden-brown. Cook in batches and keep warm.To serve, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the bacon until crisp. Pile a few pancakes onto each plate and serve with the chicken and bacon on the side, a generous drizzle of maple syrup and a sprinkling of chilli.
