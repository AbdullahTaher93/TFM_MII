Lay each slice flat of pork on a chopping board and gently bash with a meat hammer or rolling pin until approximately 5mm/¼ in thick.Top each slice with a sage leaf, season with salt and pepper and wrap in a slice of prosciutto.Place the flour in a wide dish and coat each slice well, patting off any excess.Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the oil. Cook the slices for 2–4 minutes on each side, or until the pork has cooked through and prosciutto becomes crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.Add the garlic to the pan for a minute before adding the cherry tomatoes, green beans and white wine. Cook for 4–5 minutes, or until the beans are tender (you may need a splash of water to bring it together).Serve the saltimbocca with the vegetables.
