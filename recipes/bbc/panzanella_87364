Preheat the oven to 110C/225F/Gas Â¼ or its lowest setting.Rip the bread into bite-sized pieces, place on a baking tray and bake for about 20 minutes. Make sure it doesn't burn - what you're looking for is bread that comes out feeling a little stale.Meanwhile, put the anchovies, two tablespoons of the capers, the oil and vinegar in a pestle and mortar and smash it into a dressing.Grab yourself a big mixing bowl and put in the tomatoes and bread and pour on the dressing, then get stuck in with your hands. Give it all a gentle squeeze to make sure the spongy bread soaks up all the juices.Finally tip your salad leaves onto a serving plate and drop the contents of the bowl over the top, finishing off with the remaining capers and some salt and pepper.
