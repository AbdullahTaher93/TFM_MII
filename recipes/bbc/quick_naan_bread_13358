For the naan bread, preheat the oven to 225C/200C fan/Gas 8 and place a thick baking tray into the oven to heat.Whisk together the sugar, egg and milk in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and knead lightly to make a soft dough - take care not to work the dough too much or it will become too stretchy.When all the ingredients are mixed thoroughly, cover with a damp cloth and leave to rest, in a warm place, for 15 minutes.Once rested, knead the dough with the oil until smooth.Divide the dough into 8 equal-sized balls and roll out into a circle of approximately 10cm/4in diameter.Spread the circles on the hot tray in the oven. Bake for 4-5 minutes - you might need to turn the bread to ensure it is all cooked. You will also most likely need to cook the bread in batches. Brush with melted ghee.
