Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Tip the chicken into a large roasting tray and sprinkle over the spices. Lightly crush the garlic, leaving the skins on, and add to the tray with the chicken. Drizzle with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 30 minutes, turning halfway through cooking, until the chicken is lightly charred on the outside and perfectly cooked inside.While the chicken is cooking, make the salad. Tip the sweetcorn into a bowl then finely chop the pepper (removing the seeds) and add to the bowl. Finely slice the spring onions then add to the bowl along with a squeeze of lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper.Shred the chicken from the bone and then wrap in tortilla wraps with the salad.
