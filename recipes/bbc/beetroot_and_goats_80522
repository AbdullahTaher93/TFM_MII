Place half the beetroot with the stock into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Grate or finely chop the remaining beetroot and leave to drain in a colander.Heat the olive oil and half the butter in a large casserole dish or saucepan. Add the onion and fry gently until very soft. Add the garlic and cook for 2–3 minutes. Stir in the risotto rice and thyme until coated in the oil and butter.Turn the heat to high and pour in the wine. Cook for 1–2 minutes until reduced. Turn the heat down to medium and add a ladleful of the beetroot stock. Season with salt and pepper. Stir continuously until the liquid has been absorbed. Repeat until all the stock has been added. At this point the rice will have a creamy texture but still be al dente.Beat in the remaining butter and grated beetroot. Stir through the herbs, if using, and check the seasoning, you might want to add a squeeze of lemon juice. Remove the thyme sprig.For the garnish, half fill a heavy-based saucepan or deep fat fryer with vegetable oil (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended). When it has reached 170C, add the kale leaves a few at a time. Cook for 1 minute or until crisp and glossy. Drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with salt.Divide the risotto between 4 warmed plates and crumble over the goats’ cheese and a sprinkle of parmesan at the table. Garnish with the kale.
