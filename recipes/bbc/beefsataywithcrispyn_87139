For the beef satay, place the beef into a small bowl with the soy sauce, honey, chilli flakes, sesame oil, lime juice and zest and leave to marinate for ten minutes.Thread the beef onto skewers that have been soaked in water. Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the skewers and brown them on all sides for 1-2 minutes.For the noodles, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Carefully drop in the noodles and cook for two minutes, or until puffed up and crisp. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.To serve, pile the noodles onto a serving plate, top with the beef satay kebabs and sprinkle with chopped peanuts.
