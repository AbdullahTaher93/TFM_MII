To make the marinade, crush the garlic and combine it with the paprika, thyme, lemon juice, oil and plenty of salt and pepper. To get more flavour out of the thyme leaves, gently bash them with a rolling pin before adding them to the marinade.Marinade the pork chops (do this in a bowl covered in cling film, not a plastic bag, as any sharp pieces of bone might pierce the bag) for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.To cook the chops on the barbecue, heat the charcoal until the coals are grey and hot, using tongs to pick up any pieces that are not catching and piling them into the middle. When this is done, spread the charcoal out so you can fit the grill over the top. If using a grill, preheat to high.Remove the chops from the marinade. Using a sharp pair of scissors, create several cuts through the rind of each one to make sure they cook evenly.Spray the barbecue grill or grill pan with cooking oil to stop the pork from sticking. Cook the chops for roughly 4 minutes on each side on the hottest, middle part of the grill, turning them when they have become charred on each side. You know theyâ€™re ready when the middle of the chop no longer feels squishy when you press down on it with tongs.
