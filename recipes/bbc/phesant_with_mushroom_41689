Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.For the fig tart, put the caster sugar in a pan and bring to the boil. Cook until the sugar is melted and a deep caramel colour. (CAUTION: boiling sugar is extremely hot. Handle very carefully. Use a deep pan to avoid bubbling over.)Carefully pour the caramel into two holes of a silicone muffin mould and place the figs cut side down in the holes. Roll out the pastry to 1cm/½in thickness. Cut out circles that are slightly bigger than the muffin holes. Place the pastry over the top of the figs and tuck in the sides. Bake for 10-15 minutes until golden-brown.For the fig purée, cut the figs in half and scoop out the flesh. Heat the butter in a pan until foaming and add the fig flesh. Add the port and cook for 10-15 minutes. Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth, then pass through a sieve. Finish with a little more butter and season with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm.Remove the fig tarts from the oven and leave to rest before serving. Keep the oven on for the pheasant.Place the pheasant crowns in a saucepan and add the stock, thyme and garlic. Poach for 6-8 minutes, then drain. Heat a frying pan and add the oil and butter. Add the crowns to the pan and fry until brown all over, then transfer to the oven for 2-3 minutes, or until cooked through.For the mushrooms and kale, bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and blanch the kale for 1-2 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat a large frying pan and add the butter. When foaming, add the mushrooms and fry for 1-2 minutes before adding the kale. Stir well and season with salt and pepper.Place some fig purée on serving plates and top with the pheasant crowns. Put the fig tarts alongside and garnish with the mushrooms and kale. Pour over some gravy and serve.
