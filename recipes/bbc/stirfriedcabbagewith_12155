Remove and discard the outer leaves from the cabbage and cut the leaves into large pieces.Pound the garlic in a mortar and pestle with a large pinch of salt until coarsely ground.Heat a wok until very hot, add a generous amount of olive oil and heat until almost smoking.Add the garlic to the wok, then immediately add the cabbage and stir-fry, moving the wok contents constantly to prevent the garlic from burning.Cook, adding extra oil as necessary, over high heat until the cabbage is warmed through and still crunchy.Transfer to a large serving platter and sprinkle generously with freshly ground black pepper.
