Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and add a squeeze of lemon juice. Cook the artichoke for 20–30 minutes until softened.Heat a little oil in a frying pan and add the shallot. Season the livers with salt and pepper, add to the pan and fry until cooked. To test, remove a piece of liver from the pan and cut it open; it should be moist but no longer bloody (a little tinge of pink is fine). Add the brandy and flambé.Mix together the sugar, remaining lemon juice and the orange segments and their juice and heat in a small pan. Add the stock and reduce to a sauce consistency, then fold in the livers.Heat a little oil in another frying pan and reheat the artichoke. When hot, carefully cut in half, then fill with the duck liver mixture.Melt the butter in a small frying pan and fry the smoked duck until crisp.To serve, place half a stuffed artichoke on each plate and finish with the candied orange peel and smoked duck.
