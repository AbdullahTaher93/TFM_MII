Put the miso paste and just-boiled water in a measuring jug. Lightly snap the lemongrass in a couple of places to release the flavour, without breaking it. Add the lemongrass and soy sauce to the miso stock, then stir well. Add the dried noodles and set aside.Heat 2 tablespoons of the coconut oil in a large wok or wide-based saucepan. Stir-fry the aubergine and cashews for 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the white parts of the pak choi and stir-fry for 2 minutes.Add the remaining coconut oil and stir in the spring onions, ginger and garlic. Cook for 20â€“30 seconds, stirring constantly, then carefully add the miso stock, noodles and lemongrass. Use a spoon or fork to separate the noodle strands. Stir in the green part of the pak choi and the chilli. Bring the broth to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes, or until the noodles are tender, stirring regularly.Divide the broth between warmed bowls, top with the tofu, if using, scatter with coriander and serve.
