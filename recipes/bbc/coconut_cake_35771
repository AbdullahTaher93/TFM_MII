Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Grease two 20cm/8in sandwich tins and line the bases with buttered baking paper.Cream the butter and caster sugar together for 3–4 minutes, or until pale and light – this is easiest using a free-standing mixer but an electric hand-whisk works well too. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula from time to time.Gradually add the eggs, mixing well between each addition. Add the vanilla extract and lime zest and mix again. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into the bowl, add the desiccated coconut and coconut cream and beat again until the mixture is smooth and the ingredients are well combined.Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins and bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the cakes are well-risen, golden-brown and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Leave the cakes to cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then carefully turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely.Reduce the oven temperature to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3½. Tip the coconut chips onto a baking tray and cook for 2–3 minutes, or until very lightly golden at the edges. Leave to cool.To make the coconut icing, beat the butter until really pale and light using a free-standing mixer or hand-held electric whisk. Gradually add the icing sugar, mixing well between each addition. Slowly add the coconut cream and mix again. Finally add the vanilla, lime zest and a pinch of salt and mix until well combined.Place one cake on a serving plate and spread the top with 4 tablespoons of the coconut icing. Top with the second cake. Cover the top and sides of the whole cake with the icing, spreading smoothly and evenly using a palette knife. Scatter the toasted coconut flakes over the top to serve.
