Put all the ingredients into a preserving pan. Slowly bring to the boil until the sugar has dissolved.Simmer for 1Â½-2 hours, stirring from time to time to stop the chutney sticking to the pan.When it is very thick and you can draw a wooden spoon across the base of the pan so that it leaves a channel behind it that does not immediately fill with liquid, the chutney is ready.Turn into sterilised jars, seal and cool.Store in a cool, dark cupboard for two to three months before eating.
