Do not leave unattended.). Fry the tortilla triangles until just golden-brown and crisp, then drain on kitchen paper.Fry the eggs in a little oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, until cooked to your liking.Stir the tortillas into the sauce, folding lightly to coat them but taking care not to break them. Divide the mixture between four warm shallow bowls and top each one with a fried egg. Top with crumbled cheese, the shallot, coriander and soured cream. Serve immediately.
