Preheat the grill to high. Mix the marinade ingredients together in a bowl. Add the lamb and set aside to marinate for 10 minutes, or longer if possible.Meanwhile, sit the peppers, cut side down, on one side of the grill pan. Toss the shallots in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange them on the other side. Slide under the grill to cook for 10–12 minutes, turning the shallots halfway through the cooking time, until the pepper skins are blackened and the shallots golden and slightly charred. Immediately transfer the peppers to a bowl, cover with cling film, and leave to sweat for 10 minutes to loosen the skins.Meanwhile, heat a griddle or heavy-based frying pan over a high heat until hot. Remove the steaks from the marinade and quickly fry on both sides. Reduce the heat and fry for 3–5 minutes on each side until golden brown but still slightly pink in the middle. Transfer to a plate, cover with kitchen foil and leave to rest for 5 minutes.Peel and discard the skins of the grilled peppers and then cut the flesh into large pieces. Add to the pan with the shallots to heat through.Arrange the vegetables on a plate. Cut the lamb into slices and place on top. Mix the balsamic glaze with 4 tablespoons of water and add to the pan with any remaining marinade and resting juices. Deglaze the pan for 30 seconds and pour the sauce over the lamb to serve.
