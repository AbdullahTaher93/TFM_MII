Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.Whisk together two eggs, the milk, flour and a generous amount of salt and pepper to make the pancake batter.Squeeze as much water as possible out of the spinach, then finely chop it and fold it into the pancake batter.Melt the butter in an oven-proof frying pan over a medium–high heat. Swirl the butter up the sides of the pan so it is well coated. Pour the batter into the pan, then transfer to the oven for 10 minutes.Carefully remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle with the ham. Crack the egg into the middle of the pancake, and return the pan to the oven for 5–6 minutes, or until the egg white is set but the yolk is still runny.Remove the pancake from the oven and, using a rubber spatula, gently slide it onto a plate. Top with freshly grated Parmesan and more  black pepper before serving.
