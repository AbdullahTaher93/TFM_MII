For the game terrine, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.Line a terrine mould with cling film or aluminium foil and then lay the slices of bacon in the mould with the bacon overlapping. Keep some bacon aside for covering the top of the terrine.Put all the other terrine ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine.Fill the terrine mould with the game filling and place the remaining bacon over the top.Place the terrine in a deep baking tray and pour in boiling water until it reaches two-thirds of the way up the sides of the mould. This bain marie method of cooking allows the heat of the oven to cook the terrine very gently. Bake for 1-1Â¼ hours.For the salad put the lettuce in a bowl. Mix the oil, vinegar and mustard in a small bowl to make a dressing.To serve, turn the terrine out and cut some slices. Just before serving pour the dressing over the salad and mix. Serve a slice of terrine on a plate with the salad and toast.
