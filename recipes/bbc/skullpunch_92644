For the spiced pumpkin purée, bring a small amount of water to a simmer in a pan. Suspend a steaming basket above the water (do not allow the base of the basket to touch the water). Add the chopped pumpkin and steam for 15-20 minutes, or until tender. Remove from the steaming basket and set aside to cool.When the pumpkin has cooled, transfer it to the bowl of a food processor. Add the orange juice, allspice and honey and blend until smooth and well combined.For the cocktail, mix together the pumpkin purée, pineapple juice, grenadine and crushed ice in a large jug until well combined.Chill in the fridge for at least one hour.To serve, pour the mixture into a large bowl (preferably skull-shaped). The mixture should half-fill the bowl. Top up with the lemonade. Mix well. Ladle into cups and garnish with Halloween jellies.
