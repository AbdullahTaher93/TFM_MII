Sieve the flour into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and crack in the eggs. Beat the eggs with a fork, gradually incorporating the flour from the outside of the well as you mix.Gradually pour in the milk, whilst whisking, until the batter is smooth and there are no lumps. Stir in the melted butter. Cover with a cloth and put in the fridge for 15 minutes.Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter. When the butter has melted, spoon 1–2 ladles of the batter into the pan. Carefully swirl the pan around until the batter has coated the bottom. Cook for 1–2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown. Repeat with the remaining mixture.To serve, transfer the pancake to a plate and sprinkle over a little cheese and ham.  Roll up the pancake while it's still warm so that the cheese melts a little.
