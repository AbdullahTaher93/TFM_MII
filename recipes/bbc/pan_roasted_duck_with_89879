For the chutney, heat two tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan, fry the cumin seeds for 1-2 minutes then add the sesame seeds, ginger and green chilli and season with a little salt.Stir for 2-3 minutes and then cover the mixture with a circle of greaseproof paper and let it cook slowly for 40-45 minutes until the ginger is almost cooked.Let the mixture cool then transfer to a food processor with the tamarind paste, palm sugar and 50ml/2fl oz water and blend to a fine paste.Heat the remaining oil in a separate pan, add the asafoetida, red chilli and mustard seeds. As the mustard seeds pop, add the curry leaves, stir for 30 seconds then pour into the ginger chutney mixture and mix well. Set aside.For the duck, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Heat a frying pan until very hot, add the duck breasts, fat side down and cook until golden brown.Turn the duck breasts over, to seal the other side, then transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10-12 minutes.Remove the duck from the oven and rest for 5-6 minutes.Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the asparagus and broccoli and boil for 2-3 minutes until just tender.Drain the asparagus and broccoli and mix with the olive oil.Heat a griddle pan until hot, add the asparagus and broccoli and sear on each side until charred.Remove and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, lay the asparagus and broccoli onto the plate. Carve the duck into slices and lay on top then place a spoonful of chutney alongside. Finish with a scattering of coriander cress.
