Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. In a roasting tray, toss together the squash, fresh chillies, cumin, chilli flakes, salt and pepper and all but one tablespoon of the oil. Roast for 30 minutes, turning halfway through, until the squash has caramelised. Leave to cool slightly.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and lightly wilt the pak choi for a minute or so, then put it in a serving dish to cool slightly.To make the dressing, whisk the vinegar and oil together in a bowl, then add the spring onions and season with salt and pepper.Scatter the squash, baby spinach and olives over the pak choi, mix, then scatter over the goatsâ€™ cheese (if using) and drizzle the dressing on top.
