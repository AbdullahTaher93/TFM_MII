Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3. Grease a 32x22cm/13x8½in Swiss roll tin with the butter and line with baking paper.Place the butter, milk, sugar and treacle in a small saucepan over a low–medium heat and stir until melted.Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda and ground ginger into a large bowl. Add the eggs and the treacle mixture and mix well using an electric hand-held mixer or a wooden spoon.Spoon the mixture evenly into the prepared Swiss roll tin. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. After baking, punch small holes all over the pudding with a toothpick or a skewer and spread a whole jar of sauce evenly over the pudding. Return the pudding to the oven for further 5 minutes. Leave to cool in its tin for 10 minutes then cut into 16 equal squares.Place two squares of pudding on top of each other on each plate. Drizzle the remaining sauce over the top of each pudding and serve immediately while they are still slightly warm, with ice cream, custard or double cream alongside.
