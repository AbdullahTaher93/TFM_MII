To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat, then add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened.Squeeze the courgette in your hands to remove all excess liquid, then add to the pan with the carrot, garlic and fennel seeds. Cook for a further 5 minutes, stirring often. Tip into a large bowl and leave to cool.When the veg mixture is cooled, add the sausagemeat, lentils, chopped sage and some salt and pepper. Mix well, then divide in half.For the sausage rolls, roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a large rectangle, about 40cm x 25cm/16in x 10in. Cut in half, so that each piece measures 25cm x 20cm/16in x 8in. Have the shorter side of each piece facing you.Shape one half of the sausage filling into a log down the right-hand side of one piece of pastry, leaving a 1cm/½in clear margin along the surrounding three edges. Brush the right edge and the top and bottom edges with a little egg wash. Fold the pastry from the left-hand side over the filling to enclose it and press the edges together to seal, using a fork.Repeat with the other piece of pastry and the rest of the filling. Place both filled pastry rolls in the fridge for an hour to rest and firm up.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment.Take the pastry rolls out of the fridge, cut each one into four even lengths, and place on the lined tray. Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until golden-brown.Leave the sausage rolls on the baking tray for a few minutes to cool slightly, then serve with a mixed leaf salad on the side.
