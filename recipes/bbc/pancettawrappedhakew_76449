To make the fish, heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Wrap the hake in the pancetta slices and then pan fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the pancetta is golden brown.For the potatoes, gently melt the butter in a pan and saut√© the garlic and spring onion for two minutes, to soften. Stir in the wine, chives and salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Over a gentle heat whisk in a little more butter to make a sauce.Add the new potatoes to the pan to warm through.To serve, transfer the buttery potatoes to a serving plate and serve the wrapped fish alongside.
