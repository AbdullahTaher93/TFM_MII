Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Line a 20cm x 30cm/8in x 12in baking tin, at least 5cm/2in deep, with baking paper. Line a baking tray with paper too.Scatter the porridge oats on the lined baking tray and lightly toast in the oven for 10–15 minutes, tossing halfway through. Remove and set aside to cool.Heat the agave nectar and coconut oil in a small saucepan over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until melted and smoothly combined. Take off the heat and stir in the orange zest and juice, and the cinnamon.Put the toasted oats into a large bowl and add the flour, dates, sesame seeds, dried apricots, pistachios and desiccated coconut and mix well. Tip into the melted mixture and stir well to combine, making sure all the dry ingredients are well coated.Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin, pressing it down firmly. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until golden-brown on top.Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes, then score into pieces with a sharp knife. Leave the flapjack to cool completely before lifting out of the tin.For the topping, if using, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water (check the base of the bowl isn’t touching the water). Remove and let cool, then drizzle over the top of the flapjack.Cut the flapjack into bars along the score lines. These flapjacks will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
