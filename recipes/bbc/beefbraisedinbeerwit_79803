Work to a paste with cold beef stock, adding just enough to bind all the ingredients.  Season to taste.Heat the remaining beef stock in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Shape the paste into 2cm/Â¾in dumplings and drop them into boiling beef stock. Cook until light and puffed up. This should take about 30 minutes.Remove from the stock and add to your beef casserole.For the mashed potato, simmer the potatoes in salted water for 12-15 minutes.

Check seasoning.Serve the beef and dumplings with a dollop of mashed potato.
