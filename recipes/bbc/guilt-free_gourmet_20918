Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and flour the moulds, then line the bases with a disc of oiled parchment paper.To make the pudding, soak the dates in the boiling water for five minutes, then blend in a food processor until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and blend again until well combined.Spoon the mixture into the prepared moulds (but not right to the top, as they rise quite a bit) and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until they are risen and firm. (You can check they are cooked by inserting a skewer into the middle - if it comes out clean, the pudding is ready.)Ten minutes before the puddings are ready, make the toffee sauce. Melt the butter, coconut palm sugar, blackstrap molasses and maple syrup in a saucepan over low heat, then simmer for a few minutes. Gradually stir in the soy cream, vanilla extract and salt and bring to the boil for 1â€“2 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Keep warm until ready to serve.Leave the puddings to cool in their moulds for a few minutes, then turn out onto serving plates. Spoon the toffee sauce over and around with a little extra soy cream to top it off.
