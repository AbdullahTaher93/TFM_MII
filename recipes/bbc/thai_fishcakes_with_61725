Mix together the cod, spring onions, parsley and Thai green curry paste. Add the egg and a pinch  of salt and pepper and mix thoroughly.Heat the sesame oil in a small frying pan, over a medium–low heat and add the fish cake mixture in 2 spoonfuls. Try to shape into 2 circles–it’s almost like cooking thick pancakes. Cook for 5 minutes, then flip and cook for another 5 minutes, or until they are golden-brown on both sides.Just before you flip the fish cakes, to make the noodles, heat the sesame oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Add the sliced green beans and cook for 2 minutes, then add the beansprouts and cook for another minute.Add the noodles to the wok and spread them out using tongs or chopsticks  –  you want them to get a lot of heat. Mix gently and cook for 2 minutes.Add the Sriracha, soy sauce, and a tablespoon of cold water, and toss carefully. Cook for 1 minute, or until the noodles are semi-soft.Divide the noodles between two bowls or plates, top with the fish cakes and enjoy!
