Set the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Cut the aubergines in half and score the cut sides with a lattice pattern, careful not to go down far enough to pierce the skin.Place the aubergines cut-side up in a roasting tin along with the garlic cloves still in their skins.Brush the aubergines generously with olive oil, season with a little salt and bake for 1 hour until soft. Remove from the oven, and scoop the flesh into a bowl without tearing the skin.Pop the garlic cloves from their skins with your finger and thumb, then crush to a paste with the back of a fork.Break the pomegranate and remove the seeds. Toss most of the seeds with the aubergine flesh, the crushed roasted garlic, a little salt and pepper, the pomegranate molasses and the mint leaves.Spoon the filling into the empty shells, then crumble the feta cheese over the top, together with a few pomegranate seeds and a little more mint. Serve.
