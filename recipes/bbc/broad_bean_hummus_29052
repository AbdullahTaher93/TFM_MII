Cook the podded broad beans in a pan of boiling, salted water for a minute or two, or until tender. Drain and cool in iced water.Once cold, the beans are ready to drain and re-pod (double podding stage): remove the skin from the bright green beans.Place the broad beans (saving a few for garnish), chickpeas, crushed garlic, tahini paste, lemon juice, salt, cumin, white pepper and caster sugar, if using, in a food processor and blend until smooth, loosening with the reserved chickpea liquor.As the mix continues to pur√©e, slowly pour in the olive oil until completely combined.Serve the homemade broad bean hummus spooned or piped into a bowl, topped with the saved broad beans, toasted sesame seeds and a little drizzle of olive oil with the melba toast.
