Preheat the oven to 245C/225C Fan/Gas 9.For the curry paste, put all the ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth. If the paste is very thick, add a little water and blend again.For the tofu, heat the peanut oil in a wok or a large frying pan over a high heat, add the tofu and stir-fry for 10 minutes, turning, or until browned. Add the peppers and continue to stir-fry. Add the curry paste and cook for 2-3 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk, fish sauce and lime juice. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated, then set aside.For the Yorkshire puddings, add a teaspoon of vegetable oil to each hole of a muffin tin. (You have enough batter for 18 small Yorkshire puddings.) Preheat in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the oil is smoking hot.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix the flour, sea salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, chilli powder and cumin powder together until well combined.In a separate bowl lightly whisk the milk and eggs. Add to the flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Set aside to rest in the fridge for at least a few minutes or ideally half an hour.Carefully remove the hot tins from the oven and using a measuring jug pour the batter evenly into each hole. Bake for 12 minutes, or until golden-brown and risen. Remove from oven and cool in the tins for few minutes, then remove and place onto a wire rack to cool further.To assemble, put the Yorkshire puddings on a serving platter. If necessary, gently push down in the middle of the Yorkshire to create a dip. Spoon a generous amount of the tofu mixture into them. Top each one with a Thai basil or coriander leaf. Arrange the lime wedges around the serving platter and serve.
