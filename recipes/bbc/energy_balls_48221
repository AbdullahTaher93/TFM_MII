Put the dates, cashew nuts, vanilla extract, ground oats, peanut butter, agave nectar, coconut oil and ground almonds into a high-powered blender. Pulse the mixture until combined. You might find it sticks to the sides, so give the blender a shake. The mixture needs to be dry enough to hold together, but moist enough to roll into balls. If it's too wet, add more ground almonds.Spread out your chosen coating in a shallow dish. Line a tray with baking paper.Divide the mixture into 12 portions. Roll into balls in the palms of your hands, then roll each ball in your coating of choice and set it on the prepared tray. Transfer to the fridge and leave to set for about 2 hours.
