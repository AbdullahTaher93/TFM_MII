Place the chicken wings into a large bowl or dish. Pour over the soy sauce and cola, and add the garlic. Mix well to ensure that all parts of every chicken wing are coated.  Cover and leave in the fridge overnight to marinade.Once ready to cook, heat the oil in a large frying pan. Remove the chicken wings from the marinade, reserving the marinade for later. Fry the chicken wings in a single layer (you may need to do this in batches) in the hot pan for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until lightly coloured.Pour over the reserved marinade (adding all of the wings to the pan if you coloured them in batches) and 100ml/3Â½fl oz of water. Cook over a medium heat, turning the wings now and again for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken wings are cooked through and the sauce is reduced and sticky. Serve hot.
