Place the pile of spinach in the centre of the baking parchment, followed by the trout fillet, the lemon slices, dill and white wine. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Bring the sides of the foil together over the fish and secure. Scrunch the two open ends together to make a 'tent' for the fish.
