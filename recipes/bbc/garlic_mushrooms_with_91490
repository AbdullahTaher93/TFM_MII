Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the garlic and fry, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.Add the mushrooms and continue to fry on a high heat until the mushrooms are just browned – if cooked on a high enough heat they should not give out any liquid – if they do, continue to cook until the pan is dry.Season with salt and pepper, then pour in two tablespoons of the sherry vinegar – the pan should sizzle. Continue to cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.Serve with another drizzle of olive oil, a light sprinkling of paprika and plenty of parsley or coriander.
