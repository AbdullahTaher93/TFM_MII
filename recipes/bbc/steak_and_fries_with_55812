Marinade the steaks in the oil, black and pink peppercorns and the fennel seeds for up to half an hour. Preheat a griddle pan. Rub the steaks with oil and season with salt and pepper.When the griddle is very hot, cook the steaks on both sides for 2-3 minutes, then set aside and keep warm. Let them rest for the same amount of time as they were cooked.For the b√©arnaise sauce, place the vinegar, shallot, black peppercorns and stalks of the tarragon in a small saucepan with 2 tablespoons water and cook until it has reduced in volume by half. Strain and transfer to a food processor.Add the egg yolks and start to blend. With the motor running, gradually add the melted butter until you have a smooth sauce. Finish with the chopped tarragon leaves, salt and pepper.To make the chips, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan half full with vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 180C (use a probe thermometer to check the temperature if you're not using a deep-fat fryer). (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Don't leave unattended.)Pat the cut potato dry using a tea towel or kitchen paper. Carefully add the chips to the oil and deep-fry until cooked through (about 3 minutes). Set aside to drain on kitchen paper.To serve, cut the steaks into slices and serve with the fries and sauce.
