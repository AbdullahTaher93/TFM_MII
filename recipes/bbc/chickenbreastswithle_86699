Add the remaining 30ml/1fl oz of olive oil to the pan and heat.Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry. Add the chicken breasts to the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes on both sides, until golden-brown all over.Remove from the heat and add the vegetables, then, using a sieve, strain the marinade over the chicken. Discard the solid marinade ingredients.Transfer to the oven and cook for one hour, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced by half.About 15 minutes before the end of cooking time, pour in the saffron and its soaking liquid.To serve, remove the chicken from the oven and place onto plates.
