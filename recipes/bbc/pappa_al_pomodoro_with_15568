Add the onion and cook for a few minutes, until softened. Add the bottled and fresh tomatoes, sourdough, basil leaves, sugar and a pinch of salt. Cover and cook for a few minutes.For the salmoriglio, put all the ingredients apart from the chilli in a pestle and mortar and grind until amalgamated. Stir in the chilli and a pinch of salt, then set aside.Cut each octopus tentacle into bite-sized pieces. Score the squid across the body. Pat everything dry. Toss the octopus pieces and squid, with its tentacles, in the oil.Heat a frying pan over a medium-high heat. Put the octopus in the pan cut-side down. Add the squid and prawns and season with salt and pepper. Squeeze over the lemon juice and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the prawns and squid are cooked through. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the anchovy and half the salmoriglio.To serve, spoon the pappa al pomodoro into two deep serving plates, place the seafood on top and drizzle with the remaining salmoriglio. Sprinkle over the basil and serve with the toasted flatbread.
