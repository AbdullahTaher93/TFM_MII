Heat the oil in a casserole dish over a medium heat. Add the chicken and bacon and cook, stirring all the time, while they brown. Add the venison and cook until sealed all over.Add the green pepper, onion, garlic and celery to the pan and cook for 8â€“10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft.Add the smoked paprika, half a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon of sea salt flakes and the cayenne pepper, if using. Mix well then pour in the chicken and beef stock. Cover and bring to the boil, then simmer for 2 hours.Add the potatoes, sweetcorn and butterbeans to the pan and simmer with the lid off so the stew reduces and begins to thicken. Cook until the potatoes are tender. (For a thicker stew, crush a few of the potatoes in the pan so they release more starch.)Scatter over the chopped parsley, drizzle with the Worcestershire sauce and serve with rice or cornbread.
