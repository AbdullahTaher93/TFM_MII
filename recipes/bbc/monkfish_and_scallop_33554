To make the grilled vegetables, heat a griddle pan until smoking hot, rub the oil onto the aubergine, pepper and courgettes and griddle in batches, until soft and tender. Be careful not to crowd the pan. Set aside to cool slightly.Mix the vegetables with the vinegar, olive oil and basil. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.To make the monkfish and scallop spiedini, preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.Strip the needles off the rosemary sprigs so there is just a clump of needles on the top of each sprig. Push the rosemary through the middle of the monkfish then do the same with the scallop. Repeat this so you have 2 scallops and 2 pieces of monkfish on each sprig.Heat a non-stick pan and rub the skewers with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.Put the skewers into the hot pan and cook for 1–2 minutes, so the fish and scallops have a little colour.Add the tomatoes, capers, garlic and parsley to the pan and put in the oven for 3–5 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.Remove from the oven and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. To serve, put the skewers onto a warmed plate and cover with the tomato mixture and the grilled vegetables alongside.
