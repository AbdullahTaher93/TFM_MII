Add the peppers followed by the vinegar and chicken stock. Cook for 5 minutes then blitz in a blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.For the chickpeas, heat the oil in a deep fat fryer or a deep-sided, heavy bottomed pan to 180C, or until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not over-fill the pan or leave unattended). Deep-fry the chickpeas for 2 minutes. Mix the spices and salt together, drain the chickpeas and season with the spiced salt.Lightly oil the pork on both sides and place on a hot griddle.
