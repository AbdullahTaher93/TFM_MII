Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease the sides and line the base of a 20cm/8in springform cake tin with baking paper.To make the cake, combine the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a large bowl.Whisk the oil, sugar and coconut milk together in a jug, followed by the lemon zest and 3 tablespoons of juice and the vanilla extract.Pour the jug of liquid ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients, whisking to combine, then pour into the prepared tin and bake for 30–35 minutes, by which time the top will be golden brown, the sides shrinking away from the tin and a cake tester should come out clean. Transfer to a wire rack and leave the cake to cool completely in its tin. It may sink slightly as it cools.To make the compôte, put the blueberries, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, caster sugar and 50ml/2fl oz of cold water into a saucepan and bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and simmer, stirring gently every now and again, for a couple of minutes until the blueberries have softened. Remove the pan from the heat.Mix 1½ teaspoons of cold water with the cornflour in a small cup and stir the paste into the compôte. Put the pan back over the heat and stir gently for about 30 seconds until bubbling and thickened. If you feel it has become too jammy and thick, simply add a little more water and stir it in over the heat. Pour the compôte into a small heatproof bowl or jug to cool and set.Just before serving, remove the cold cake from its tin and place on a cake stand or plate.Mix the coconut-milk yoghurt and vanilla together, spoon the icing sugar into a tea-strainer, then sieve it over the yoghurt and stir it in before spreading and swirling this soft mixture over the top of the cake. Loosen the blueberry compôte a little with a fork and gently spoon on top, leaving a gleaming white frame. Serve immediately.
