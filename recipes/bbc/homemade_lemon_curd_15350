Break the eggs into a saucepan and whisk to combine. Stir in the remaining ingredients and place over a medium heat.Whisk continuously over the heat until the mixture coats the back of a spoon and is slightly thickened – this could take 7–10 minutes. Do not allow the mixture to boil or it may split.Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Spoon into a sterilised jar (or two small jars) seal, and leave to thicken.Keep in the fridge for up to a month, but use within a week of opening the jar.
