To make the dough by hand, put the flour, salt and yeast into a large bowl. Mix well, then pour in the water and combine to make a sticky dough.Flour the work surface generously, then turn out the dough and knead lightly. Knead in some of the flour from the work surface, adding a little more if the dough remains sticky. It should come away from the surface cleanly.Keep kneading until the dough no longer sticks to the surface. Continue kneading in no particular fashion for a full 5 minutes, then put the dough into a floured bowl and set aside, covered with cling film or a clean tea towel, until it has risen to double its size. This takes anything up to an hour, depending on the warmth of your room.Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. The dough makes enough for six pides, and the following instructions will be for one.Divide the dough into six balls of equal size and weight. On a floured board roll each piece into an oblong measuring roughly 35cm/14in x 15cm/6in. Transfer to a baking tray.Mix the cheese with the chilli flakes and cover the base of the dough with the mixture, leaving a 2cm/¾in gap around the edges.Lay the tomatoes evenly across the cheese, making two rows down the middle. Top with a row of sausage slices.Fold the sides of the dough over to create a wall that will hold the filling in. Secure by twisting the ends. Finish with a final trickle of olive oil and bake for 15–20 minutes.
