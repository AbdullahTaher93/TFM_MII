Barbecue the rounds of courgette for 3 minutes on each side. Lightly brush the Little Gem quarters with olive oil and barbecue for 2 minutes on each side.To make the crispy kale, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan two-thirds full with the vegetable oil. Heat to 180C (a cube of bread should turn brown in 1 minute when dropped in.) CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended. Deep-fry the kale until crisp, then drain on kitchen paper. Mix the salt and sugar with a pinch of smoked paprika and sprinkle over the kale.To make the scallops and prawns, place the pre-soaked plank on one side of the barbecue.
