For the pâté, remove the flesh from the fish, discarding all the skin and bones, and place into a blender. Add the lemon juice and blend quickly with the cream to a slightly coarse pâté. Transfer the pâté from the blender to a bowl, add the chives and season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the pâté into a pot, smooth over the surface and place in the fridge.To make the dressing, place both the vinegars in a bowl. Whisk in 225ml/8fl oz of the olive oil then check the flavour for balance of oil and acidity, adding more oil if needed.Shape the pâté into quenelles. Dress the salad leaves with a little of the vinaigrette and cut the eggs in half. Place the beetroot in overlapping circles on a plate, place the salad leaves on top of the beetroot, top with the pâté and the egg and garnish with a few chervil leaves. Serve with slices of warm Melba toast.
