For the sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook over a medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, until softened.Add the bacon to the pan and fry gently until lightly golden-brown, about ten minutes.Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well.Reduce the heat and simmer until the tomatoes begin to break down, about five minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper, but take care with the salt as the bacon is salty.For the pasta, place the salt into a saucepan of boiling water and add the penne.Boil for 8-10 minutes, or according to packet instructions, until al dente (the pasta should give some resistance when bitten into). Drain, then add to the pan with the sauce and mix well.Meanwhile, for the bruschetta, preheat the grill to medium. Toast the ciabatta halves on both sides.Lightly rub the cut sides of the garlic clove over the ciabatta halves.Drizzle generously with olive oil.Place the tomatoes on top of the ciabatta. Tear the mozzarella into pieces and place on top of the tomatoes.Season, to taste, with salt and drizzle over a little more olive oil. Tear the basil leaves into pieces and scatter over the top.To serve, divide the pasta between two bowls and sprinkle over the parmesan. Serve with the bruschetta with mozzarella.
