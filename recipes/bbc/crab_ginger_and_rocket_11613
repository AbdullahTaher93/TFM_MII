For the sushi rolls, preheat a deep fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Whisk together the egg whites and iced water in a shallow bowl and place the seasoned flour in another shallow bowl. Dip each crab into the egg white mixture and then into the seasoned flour. Carefully add the crab to the deep fat fryer and fry for 2–3 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain and cool.Lay the nori sheet on the bamboo mat. Scatter over the sesame seeds. Season the sushi rice with the sushi vinegar and spread the rice over the top of the sesame seeds. Add a thin layer of the rocket down the middle and place the avocado batons on either side. Add two of the crabs and the ginger on top and roll tightly. Reserve the remaining crab. Chill the sushi roll for 1 hour to firm up before slicing into 6–8 pieces.To make the miso mayonnaise, place the egg yolks into a bowl and whisk gently with an electric handheld whisk. Gradually add the oil a little at a time whisking until it thickens and then pour in the rest of the oil in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Add the miso paste and salt at the end and whisk until just mixed.To make the dipping sauce, mix the soy sauce and the mirin together and transfer to a small serving bowl. Serve the dipping sauce with the sushi rolls, miso mayonnaise and the remaining soft shell crab cut in half.
