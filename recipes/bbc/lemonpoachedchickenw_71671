Place the thyme, sage, the last clove of garlic and a few basil leaves into a blender with the juice of a lemon and equal amounts of olive oil.

Drain the poaching liquor and place the semi-sliced chicken back into the dry pan.Pour the lemon and herb marinade over the chicken and make sure it coats the chicken evenly.  Heat through.To serve, spoon the tomato sauce on the bottom of a dish, finish slicing the chicken and place on top.  Drizzle over the remaining marinade and sprinkle on some chopped basil.
