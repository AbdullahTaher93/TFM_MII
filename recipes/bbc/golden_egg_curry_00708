Blend the 2 green chillies and 1 roughly chopped green finger chilli, shallots, garlic, ginger and turmeric to a paste using a stick blender or mini food processor.Heat the oil in a heavy-based wok or a similar-sized pan with a lid, add the paste and the lemongrass and fry gently, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, until the paste is cooked and softened.Add the coconut milk, salt and tamarind with 100ml/3Â½fl oz freshly boiled water. Make a couple of little incisions in each of the 3 whole finger chillies with the point of a small sharp knife and add to the pan. Turn the heat up to bring to a near boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for about 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce has cooked and reduced to a thick golden soup.Crack the eggs into the sauce, cover with a lid and leave to simmer very gently for about 4 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks still runny, or cook for longer if you want well-cooked yolks.Divide between two bowls, trying to spoon out most of the sauce from the pan first. Serve with rice, flatbreads or both.
