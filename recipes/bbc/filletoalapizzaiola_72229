In a hot griddle pan, sear the steak on both sides (approximately two minutes per side for medium rare).In a separate frying pan (30cm/12in diameter) fry the garlic in the olive oil until golden.  Add in the tomatoes, season with salt, pepper and oregano.Add the cooked steak to the sauce and continue to cook for approximately three minutes until some of the water from the tomatoes has evaporated.On the same griddle pan that you cooked the steak on, grill the ciabatta.Place three slices of ciabatta in a triangle on a plate.  Then place three medallions in the middle.Cover with a few slices of the mozzarella and then pour on some of the pizza sauce.  Serve immediately.
