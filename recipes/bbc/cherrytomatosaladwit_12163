Slice the cherry tomatoes in half, cut the potatoes into large chunks and roughly slice the mint.Simply mix the tomatoes, peas, potatoes and mint together.Add 1 part balsamic vinegar to 2 parts olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. (Be careful not to over season the salad as the anchovies cooked with the peas are quite salty themselves.)
