Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Place the butter and the caster sugar into a bowl and beat together until light and creamy. Add the sunflower oil and brown sugar and fold through to combine. Add the egg and vanilla essence and mix well.In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt and baking powder.Add the flour to the butter and sugar mixture and mix well to form a dough. Fold in the drained cherries, brandy, almonds, hazelnuts and the white and dark chocolate pieces. .On a floured work surface, carefully roll out the dough to 1cm/½in thick. Using the cookie cutter of your choice, cut out 8–16 cookies (depending on the size of the cutter).Place the cookies onto a greased baking tray (not too close together as they will spread). Place into the oven to bake for 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through.Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the trays for 8–10 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
