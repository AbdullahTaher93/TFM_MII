Line a 20cm/8in square tin with cling film, leaving an overhang so the mixture can be removed easily once set.Pour the orange juice and cranberry juice into the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle over the gelatine. Set aside to allow the gelatine to soften and absorb the liquid.Meanwhile, put the sugar, golden syrup and 150ml/¼ pint water in a saucepan. Cook over a low heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has dissolved, then immediately bring the mixture to the boil. Using a sugar thermometer, boil until the syrup reaches 130C, then remove from the heat. Leave to cool for a minute, until it is no longer bubbling.Whisk the gelatine mixture in a food mixer on a medium speed. Add the sugar syrup, slowly pouring it down the side of the mixer bowl. Try to avoid pouring directly onto the whisk or you will get grainy lumps of sugar in the marshmallow. The marshmallow mixture should become pale and grow in volume like a very stiff meringue.Once all the syrup has been added, continue to whisk for 5-10 minutes, or until the marshmallow is really thick and cools a bit more. It is ready when the outside of the bowl is only slightly warm and the marshmallow starts to get really sticky.Use an oiled spatula, scrape the marshmallow into the prepared tin, keeping the spatula clean using boiling water when it gets too sticky. Leave to set at room temperature for 1-2 hours, or until firm.Sieve the icing sugar and cornflour together into a small bowl and stir in the orange zest. Use some of this mixture to coat the top of the marshmallow. Using the overhang to lift the marshmallow up, remove it from the tin. Cut it into 4cm/1½in cubes then dust each cube in the remaining icing sugar mixture and cranberry powder. Serve on a plate or board.
