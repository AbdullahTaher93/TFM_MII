Add the bacon in batches and dry-fry until crisp. Allow to cool, then chop into pieces and set aside.Beat the eggs and the yoghurt together until smooth and aerated, then stir in the remaining ingredients until well combined.Divide the muffin batter equally among 4 of the holes of the prepared muffin tin, or until the mixture reaches three-quarters of the way up the sides.Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the tops of the muffins are golden-brown and a skewer inserted into the centre of the muffins comes out clean.
