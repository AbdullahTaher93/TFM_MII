Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and line one large baking tray with baking paper and lightly oil another one.For the baked potato wedges, place the potato wedges on the lined baking tray, drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook on the middle shelf of the oven for 30 minutes or until brown and crispy, turning the potatoes halfway through cooking.Meanwhile, for the gremolata crumb, put the sourdough, parsley and lemon zest into a small food processor and pulse to fine crumbs. Tip into a bowl and set aside.To make the tartare sauce, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and season with a little salt and pepper to taste.For the fish, turn the oven to the grill setting. Lay the fish fillets on the oiled baking tray. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with the olive oil, then top each fillet with an even layer of gremolata crumb. Grill on the top shelf of the oven for eight minutes or until the gremolata crumb is crispy and the fish is cooked. Keep a close eye on it, to make sure the topping doesnâ€™t burn!Serve the fish fillets with the tartare sauce, baked potato wedges, steamed green beans and lemon wedges for squeezing over.
