Put the fennel, asparagus and radishes into a bowl of cold water with a handful of ice added and leave to crisp up for 10 minutes or so.Season each salmon fillet with salt and pepper and dust both sides with flour. Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Place the salmon skin-side down in the pan and hold down with a spatula for 30 seconds or so. Cook, without moving, for 7–8 minutes.Meanwhile, put the broccoli and beans into a sauté pan with 200ml/7fl oz of cold water and extra virgin oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and cook over a medium heat, moving the veg around so it cooks evenly. When the liquid has almost all evaporated, add the frozen peas. Once the peas are cooked, remove from the heat and drain off any excess water.When you can see that the skin on the fish is crisp, flip the salmon fillets over and cook for 2 minutes on the other side. Remove from the heat and leave to rest while you make the dressing.Whisk the dressing ingredients together in a bowl and pour over the warm veg in the pan. Drain the fennel, asparagus and radishes and add to them the pan.
