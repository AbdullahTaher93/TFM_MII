Lay onto a tray and set to one side.Gut and fillet the mackerel. Run the tip of a sharp filleting knife down either side of the pin bones and bloodline in the centre of each fillet and gently remove this area by pulling it away with a pair of fish tweezers. Spread the citrus cure on to a tray and place the fish fillets on it, flesh-side down.Cover with cling film and refrigerate for two hours.Rinse the fillets under cold running water to remove the cure then pat dry with kitchen paper.Heat a griddle pan until very hot.Lightly rub the mackerel skin with olive oil, place skin side down on to the griddle for two minutes, remove and continue to plate the dish.For the garnish juice a third of the cucumber and reserve the juice.Peel the remaining cucumber and then cut the 4 sides off the cucumber to leave you with a rectangle heart of the cucumber.Cut the cucumber sides into 5mm/Â¼in pieces and set aside.Heat a griddle pan until very hot.Season the cucumber hearts and drizzle with olive oil, place on the griddle and cook for two minutes per side until lightly coloured and soft.In a hot pan, pour a thin layer of olive oil and add the cut cucumber pieces.

Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, pour the vegetables into the centre of a large plate, lay the grilled fillets of mackerel on top.
