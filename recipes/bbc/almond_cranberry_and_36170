Preheat the oven to 180C/160F Fan/Gas 4 and line two baking trays with baking parchment.For the biscotti, sift the flour, salt and baking powder into a large mixing bowl. Add the rest of the biscotti ingredients and mix well.Divide the mixture into four and roll into logs around 20cm/8in long. Place two logs on each of the prepared baking trays, allowing plenty of room for them to spread. Bake for 25 minutes – they should be very pale.Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 140C/120C Fan/Gas 1.Cut the logs into slices about 5mm/¼in thick and place back on the baking trays cut-side down. Bake for 15 minutes and then carefully turn over and bake for a further 15 minutes. Place on wire rack to cool.For the decoration, melt the chocolates in two separate bowls and put the almonds and pistachios on separate plates.Dip the ends of the biscotti in either the plain or white chocolate and then coat with chopped nuts or leave with just a chocolate covering. You can also add a little edible glitter for a real Christmas sparkle.Pack into pretty jars or cellophane bags and add a ribbon and a label if desired.
