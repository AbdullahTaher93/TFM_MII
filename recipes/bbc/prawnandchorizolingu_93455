Add the chorizo and prawns and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown all over. Stir in the chopped tomato and red wine vinegar and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened and the prawns are cooked through (they should be pink and opaque).Remove the pan from the heat and add the pasta, mixing well to coat in the sauce.
