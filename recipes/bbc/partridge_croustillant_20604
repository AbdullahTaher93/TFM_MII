Bring to the boil and then simmer until the carrots are soft. Transfer to a blender and pulse until smooth. Push through a sieve, season with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve.For the partridge, preheat a deep-fat fryer to 160C. Or until a small piece of bread turns crisp and golden-brown within a minute. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Lay out 6 spinach leaves on a work surface. Put a partridge breast in the middle of each leaf and season with salt and pepper. Wrap up into a parcel, then layout 2 circles of the brick pastry and cut each circle into quarters. Wrap each spinach parcel in a quarter of pastry, brushing the edges with beaten egg to help them stay in place.Wrap the parcels completely in potato strings. Lower each parcel into the fryer and cook for 3 minutes. Remove using a slotted spoon and set aside to rest and drain on kitchen paper.Heat the butter in a large frying pan, then fry the shallot until soft. Add the mushrooms and when cooked, finish with the tarragon.When ready to serve, if necessary, fry the parcels again briefly to ensure they are hot.

Drain the blackberries and arrange them around the plates. Spoon over partridge jus and finish with a neat spoonful of carrot purée.
