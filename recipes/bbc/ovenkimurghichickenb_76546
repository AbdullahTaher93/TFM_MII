When hot, add the mustard seeds. As soon as they pop - this will be just a few seconds - add the garlic and stir.As soon as the garlic starts to brown, pour in the sauce.As soon as the sauce heats up and starts bubbling, pour it over and around the chicken without displacing the onion mixture.Place the ovenproof dish, uncovered, in the oven and bake for 25 minutes.Serve immediately with basmati rice.
