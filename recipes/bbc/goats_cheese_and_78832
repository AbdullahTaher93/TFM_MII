Preheat the grill to high.Heat a griddle pan until searing hot. Rub the courgette slices with the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Place the courgettes onto the griddle and cook for a minute on each side until marked with griddle lines.Remove the courgettes from the griddle and top with a slice of the goatsâ€™ cheese.Place the courgette and goats' cheese under the grill and cook for 1-2 minutes until the cheese has melted and turned light golden-brown.Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the peas, broad beans and asparagus and cook for two minutes until just tender. Drain and set aside.Whisk the sherry vinegar, Dijon mustard and extra virgin olive oil together with a pinch of salt, pepper and sugar.To serve, place the radishes, shallot rings, rocket, spinach and watercress leaves in a bowl and toss to combine.Gently open the pea pods, leaving them half open then add along with the broad beans and asparagus, then toss lightly once more.Lay the salad onto the plate, then carefully place a couple of pieces of courgette on top and serve immediately.
