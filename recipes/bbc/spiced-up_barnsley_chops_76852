Set aside to cool.Transfer the toasted spices to a pestle and mortar and crush until fine. Pass the crushed seeds through a sieve to remove any husks, then sprinkle the sieved spices onto a plate.Press one side of each Barnsley chop into the spice mixture until well coated. Season all over with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. First fry the fatty edges and skin side of the Barnsley chops until golden-brown, using a pair of tongs to hold the chops in place.When the fat has melted, pour any excess into a small bowl and set aside. Continue frying the chops, seasoned-side down, for 8-10 minutes, or until well browned.Turn the chops over and place a knob of butter on top of each. Fry for a further 2-3 minutes, until the lamb is medium-rare (or cooked to your liking).  Drizzle over the lemon juice and baste the chops in the pan juices.Serve the Barnsley chops drizzled with the pan juices. Sprinkle over the orange zest.
