Add the pineapple and a little extra rum. Allow to heat briefly, then slowly tilt the pan towards the flame, or light with a match. Let the flames flare up then die down (CAUTION: be careful of flames and keep your face away from the pan).  Add the butter and cook for 2 minutes.For the topping, whip the cream, icing sugar and vanilla together until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.Place the soaked brioche in a hot frying pan and cook for 2 minutes on each side until golden-brown.Put the brioche in serving dishes, cover with the caramelised pineapple, add a spoonful of the whipped cream and cover with candy floss.
