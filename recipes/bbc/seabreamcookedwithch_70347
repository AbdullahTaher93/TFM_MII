Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over a fairly high heat.Add the bream, followed by the garlic, tomatoes, basil and some salt.Pour in the water, turn the heat down slightly and cook the fish for 7 minutes on each side. When you flip the fish over you will know that it is done if the eye has turned white.Remove the fish from the pan and place on a large serving dish. Raise the heat, cook the sauce for 30 seconds to concentrate the flavours slightly and then pour it over the fish. Serve immediately, with lots of good bread to mop up the delicious sauce.
