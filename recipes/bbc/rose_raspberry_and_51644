Add the yoghurt and rose water to taste (be careful as rose water varies considerably in strength) and whisk again gently. Pour in the cooled raspberry mixture and ripple through using the back of a knife.Spoon the mixture into six 150ml/5fl oz pots and leave to chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour.Top with extra raspberries, toasted coconut flakes and crystallized rose petals and serve.
