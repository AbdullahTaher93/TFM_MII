Stir in the butter and paprika.To cook the turkey crown, preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3. Season the crown with salt and pepper, rub with oil, transfer to a roasting dish and roast for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and brush with the glaze. Continue to brush with glaze periodically for the rest of the cooking time, reserving some of the glaze for the confit legs.

Remove from the oven, cover, and leave to rest.While the crown is resting, carefully remove the confit legs from the fat. Put them on a baking tray and roast for 20 minutes to crisp. Glaze and baste the confit legs for another 20 minutes, or until golden.Serve the turkey crown and confit legs in slices with all the trimmings.
