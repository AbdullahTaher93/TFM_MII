Set aside.Put the onion, garlic, ginger and lemongrass into a food processor and blitz until finely ground.Bash open the cardamom pods, discard the skins and put the seeds into a dry pan, together with the cumin and coriander seeds. Place over a medium heat and cook for 2–3 minutes until aromatic. Transfer to a mortar or spice grinder and grind to a powder. Tip the powder into a bowl and combine with the onion and garlic mixture, turmeric, nutmeg, sugar and peanut or cashew butter.Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok or large deep pan over a medium heat. Add the curry paste mixture and fry, stirring now and again, for 3–5 minutes until cooked through and fragrant. Add the coconut milk and stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, add the aubergines and most of the chilli and cook for 15–20 minutes until slightly reduced and the aubergine is soft. Stir in the spinach until wilted down.Add the fish sauce and lemon juice, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Scatter over the Thai basil leaves and remaining chilli and serve with rice.
