Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and line a roasting tin with kitchen foil.Heat the oil in a large frying pan and stir-fry the mushrooms over a high heat for 4 minutes. Add the hazelnuts and cook for another 5 minutes until lightly toasted. Season and remove from the heat.Stir in the tomatoes, garlic, breadcrumbs, parsley and chilli flakes until thoroughly combined. Gently fold in the feta.Place the peppers, cut side up, in the tin and fill each half with the mushroom and feta stuffing. Cover the surface of the stuffing with a small piece of kitchen foil to prevent burning.Bake for 35 minutes, or until the peppers are tender, removing the foil for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time.Meanwhile line a large baking tray with baking paper.In a large glass bowl, mix together the onion, mushrooms, potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, nuts and oil.Spread half of the vegetables onto the tray. Place the fish on top and use the remaining vegetables to stuff the fish cavity and tip over the top. Add the lemon halves and bake for 20â€“25 minutes or until the fish is cooked through.Serve the whole fish on a large serving platter with the stuffed peppers around the fish. Sprinkle with fresh herbs and a squeeze of the roasted lemon.
