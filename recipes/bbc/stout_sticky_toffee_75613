For the pudding, put the dates, 100ml/3½fl oz water, the stout and bicarbonate of soda in a saucepan over a gentle heat until they soften and break down to a loose paste – it will take about 15 minutes. Leave to cool.Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Line a 15x18cm/6x7in tin with baking parchment. Cream the butter and sugar until pale, light and fluffy then gradually beat in the eggs one at a time.Fold in the flour, apricots, vanilla and the cooled date mixture.Transfer the mixture to the baking tin and bake for about 40 minutes, or until firm to the touch.For the sauce, put the cream into a saucepan with the butter, sugar, orange zest and stout. Heat the sauce over a high heat, stirring all the time and then reduce the temperature and simmer for about 8–10 minutes, stirring from time to time until it thickens a little. Allow to cool a little.To make the orange cream, zest the orange and squeeze out the juice. Whisk together the cream, icing sugar, all the orange zest and half the juice until light and fluffy.When ready to serve, cut the pudding into 6–8 portions, either using a knife or a pastry cutter.Serve each portion of the pudding topped with an orange slice and mint sprig, if using. Generously spoon the sauce alongside and over the puddings. Dollop some orange cream on the side and dust with icing sugar.
