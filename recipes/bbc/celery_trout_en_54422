For the trout, preheat the oven to 180C/200C Fan/Gas mark 6. For each piece of fish prepare a parcel by cutting a 35cm/14in square of kitchen foil. On top of this put a square of baking parchment the same size.Put the fennel, onion, celery, tomato, lemon zest and juice, dill, capers and half the olive oil in a bowl and mix together. Season with salt and pepper.Divide the fennel mixture between the squares of parchment paper and place a trout fillet on top of each pile. Drizzle over the rest of the olive oil, then add a squeeze of lemon juice to each.Fold the foil and parchment paper over the trout fillets and double-fold each edge to make a sealed parcel, leaving a gap at the top. Pour 2 tablespoons of white wine into each parcel, then fully seal. The parcel should not be too tight, as steam will puff it up in the oven.Arrange the parcels on a large baking tray and bake for 20 minutes, or until the fish is just opaque and cooked through.Put a steamer over a pan on the hob and add the potatoes. After 15 minutes add the green beans. Sream for another 5 minutes then drain. Add the butter and season with salt and pepper.Serve the parcels on warmed plates so they can be opened at the table. Have the steamed beans and potatoes in bowls to hand around separately.
