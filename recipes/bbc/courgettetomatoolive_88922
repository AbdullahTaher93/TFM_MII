Preheat the grill to medium.For the tart, place the flour, olive oil, egg yolk, salt and freshly ground black pepper into a food processor and pulse until well combined. Gradually add a little cold water, just enough to bring the mixture together into a dough.Place the dough out onto a floured work surface and lightly knead, then roll out into a 5mm/¼in thick round, big enough to fit inside an ovenproof frying pan.Heat the pan and place the dough into the bottom. Arrange the courgette and tomato slices in a spiral pattern on top, then place under the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes, until the pastry is golden-brown and the courgette and tomato begin to soften. Remove from the grill and arrange the mozzarella and black olives on top. Return to the grill and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until the mozzarella is melted.For the tomato sauce, place the tomato purée and water in a pan and heat through, stirring well.For the parsley purée, place the parsley and oil together in a mini food processor and blend until smooth.Carefully place the tart onto a serving plate and drizzle over the tomato sauce and parsley purée. Serve.
