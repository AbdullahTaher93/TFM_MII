For the kebabs, soak 24 small bamboo skewers in cold water for 20 minutes.  Alternatively you can use metal skewers.Put the pancetta (or bacon) and the chicken cubes into a food processor and blend to a smooth paste.In a small bowl, whisk the egg white with the salt, sugar, cornflour and sesame oil.  Add these to the processor and blend to make a smooth, slightly rubbery mixture.Transfer the mixture to a bowl, and stir in the water chestnuts and spring onions.Take one heaped teaspoon of the mixture at a time and squeeze it around one end of a bamboo or metal skewer, extending the kebab halfway down. Repeat until all the mixture is used up to make about 24 skewers.Sprinkle the sesame seeds on a small flat tray and roll each kebab in the sesame seeds.Heat a frying pan containing 1cm/½in of oil, until just starting to smoke, add the kebabs and cook on each side for about 1½ minutes, or until cooked through and golden-brown.Drain on kitchen paper.For the mango salsa, place all the ingredients into a bowl and mix lightly to combine.To serve, place the skewers onto a plate and serve immediately with separate bowls of soy sauce and sweet chilli sauce for dipping. Pile the salsa alongside.
