Put the popcorn kernels in a lidded, microwaveable pot and cover with the lid. Alternatively, put them in a microwavable bowl and place a microwave-safe plate on top, ensuring a little air can escape while cooking.Microwave on high until the popping sound stops, this should take between 1â€“3 minutes, depending on your microwave. Carefully remove, sprinkle over your toppings, if using, and enjoy.
