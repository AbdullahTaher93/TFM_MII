For the guacamole, place all of the guacamole ingredients into a food processor and blend until smooth.For the tortillas, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Carefully place the tortilla wedges into the hot oil and deep fry until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.To serve, place the fried tortillas onto a serving plate with the guacamole in a small bowl alongside.
