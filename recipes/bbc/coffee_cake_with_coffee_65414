Add the sifted icing sugar and beat together. Dissolve the coffee in the water and add to the buttercream and stir. Set aside.For the glacé icing, place the coffee and boiling water into a bowl to dissolve, then add the icing sugar and beat until smooth. Add a little more boiling water if needed until the mixture comes to a spreadable consistency.For the candied walnuts, place the sugar and 110ml/3½fl oz water into a saucepan and bring to a simmer.
