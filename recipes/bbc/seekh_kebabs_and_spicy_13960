Blend the onion, coriander and chillies in a food processor to form a paste.Put the lamb mince, the onion and coriander paste, ginger, garlic, chilli powder, garam masala and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using your hands, knead all the ingredients until you have a paste-like consistency.Oil your hands and shape the mixture into eight sausages around the skewers. Cover and place the kebabs in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Put the skewers directly onto an oven grill shelf, brush with oil and cook for 15–20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown and cooked through. (You might want to place an oven tray beneath the skewers to catch the fat.)Meanwhile, to make the spicy chilli corn, cut each sweetcorn into three pieces and boil in plenty of water for 8–9 minutes, or until tender.Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat and add the garlic-and-ginger paste, fenugreek, green chilli, chilli powder, turmeric and salt. Fry for 30 seconds (no longer as you don’t want it to colour). Stir in the tomatoes and cook until the sauce warms through but no more than 3 minutes. Stir in the butter.Drain the sweetcorn and return it to the pan. Pour over the sauce and mix well.Serve the kebabs with the spicy sweetcorn and lemon wedges.
