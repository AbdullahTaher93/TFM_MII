Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Generously butter and line the loaf tin with a strip of baking paper.To make the ginger pudding, tip the flour, bicarbonate of soda, and spices into a large bowl. In a separate bowl mix the egg, sugar, treacle, milk and butter together and beat until smooth.Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and beat hard, for about a minute, until smooth. Pour into the loaf tin and level the top.Bake for 30–35 minutes until dark in colour and the cake shrinks away from the sides of the tin and is springy to the touch.To make the toffee sauce, heat all the ingredients together in a saucepan until melted, bring to the boil and cook for 3–5 minutes.To serve, slice thick slices of the ginger pudding and pour over the toffee sauce.
