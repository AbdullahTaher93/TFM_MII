Put all the ingredients for the Jerk Sauce in a food processor and whiz until smooth.Place the chicken in a large shallow dish, pour over the sauce, cover and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight.On a hot griddle cook the chicken for 25-30 minutes, basting now and then with the leftover sauce. As it cooks, the thick sauce will go quite black in places, but don't worry, as it falls off it will leave behind a really well flavoured, crisp skin, with lovely moist tender meat underneath.Brush the pineapple lightly with oil and char grill until golden brown on all sides. Squeeze over the juice of one lime.Serve the jerk chicken with the rice and peas, pineapple and wedges of lime on the side.
