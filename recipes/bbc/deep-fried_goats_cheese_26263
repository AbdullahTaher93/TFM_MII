Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Place the apple, onion, chilli, pine nuts and thyme sprigs in a roasting tin and drizzle over the oil. Toss everything thoroughly in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 15–20 minutes, or until coloured and softened.Meanwhile, to make the deep-fried goats’ cheese, preheat the deep fat fryer to 180C. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Place the flour, egg and breadcrumbs in wide, shallow bowls. Dip the goats’ cheese log in the flour, egg and then the breadcrumbs until completely coated. Chill the log in the freezer for at least 15 minutes, or until firm. Carefully add the goats’ cheese log to the deep fat fryer and fry until golden. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain and cool slightly.To make the herby lentils, mix the lentils together in a large bowl and stir through the parsley and tarragon. Drizzle in 2 tablespoons of the oil and the vinegar and stir in the garlic. Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and shallow fry the buckwheat until crisp. Stir into the lentil mixture and season with salt and pepper.To serve, spread the lentil mixture over a serving dish and top with the roasted apple mixture. Serve with slices of the deep-fried goats’ cheese and watercress sprigs.
