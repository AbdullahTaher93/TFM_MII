Dry and peel off the skin.Cut the peach flesh into 5mm/Â¼in cubes. Put into a bowl and add the brandy and light muscovado sugar. Toss well, then divide among eight small tumblers or pretty water glasses.Meanwhile, add the cream into a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the caster sugar, lemon zest and juice and heat over a medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
