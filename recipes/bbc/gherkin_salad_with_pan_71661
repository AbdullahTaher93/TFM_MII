Set aside to cool to room temperature.Pop the peas from their pods and cook for a minute in a pan of boiling water. Immediately drain the peas and put them into a bowl of cold water, to stop the cooking process.Place the gherkins, radishes, capers, peas together in a bowl and mix together.Drain the cucumber, reserving the pickling liquor. Add the cucumber to the gherkin mixture and mix together.Add a little of the pickling liquour to the salad, just enough to coat the vegetables.Season the brill with salt and black pepper.Heat a frying pan until hot, add the butter and oil then add the brill and fry on each side for two minutes.To serve, using a pastry brush, brush a spoonful of the dressing onto each serving plate, then top with a handful of the salad, finishing with a scattering of coriander cress and pea shoots. Set the brill fillet alongside.
