For the asparagus, bring 400ml/14fl oz salted water to the boil in a saucepan. Add the asparagus and cook for 3–5 minutes, or until just tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and leave to cool slightly. Reserve the water in the pan. Discard the woody stems and chop the remaining stems into small pieces. Place the tips in a small bowl and stir in the lemon juice and oil.For the croquettes, bring the asparagus water back to the boil and add the peas. Cook for 1 minute then add the lovage. Cook for 30 seconds. Reserve 50g/1¾oz of the peas and some of the cooking water. Blitz the rest of the peas and lovage in a food processor.Melt the butter in a frying pan and stir in the peppercorns. Gradually stir in 60g/2¼oz of the flour and cook for a few minutes until the mixture has thickened and is smelling nutty. Add the wine and a splash of the vegetable cooking water and cook for about 3 minutes, or until thickened and a roux is created.Stir the cheeses, lemon zest, asparagus pieces, blitzed pea mixture and the reserved whole peas into the wine roux. Leave to chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.Place the remaining flour, egg and breadcrumbs onto three plates. Using oiled hands, form the roux into croquette shapes and dip in the flour, egg and breadcrumbs to coat completely. Chill in the fridge for 10 minutes.Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the croquettes for 3–5 minutes, or until crisp and golden.
