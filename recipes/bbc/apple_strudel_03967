For the filling, soak the raisins in the orange juice and zest.Cook the apples in a pan with the butter, water and sugar for 8–10 minutes, or until the apples have softened slightly, but still retain their shape.Remove the pan from the heat, add the cinnamon, raisins and juice and the breadcrumbs and stir to combine (the breadcrumbs will bind everything together). Set aside to cool.Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.For the pastry, brush the baking tray with a little of the melted butter, spread out one sheet of filo on the baking tray, and brush with some more of the butter. Repeat the process with all four sheets, placing them on top of each other, brushing with melted butter each time.Spoon the apple mixture along the middle of the pastry and roll up, longest side first, into a parcel, seam-side down. (If you like, you can scrunch up some extra filo pastry to make a decoration for the top.)Brush all over with the remaining butter and bake in the oven for 15–20 minutes, or until the top is crisp and golden-brown. (Check the strudel after 10 minutes; if it is browning too quickly, reduce the heat a little. )Dust with icing sugar and serve with double cream.
