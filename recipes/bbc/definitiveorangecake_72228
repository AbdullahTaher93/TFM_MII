Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Lightly butter two loose-bottomed 20cm/8in sandwich tins and line the bases with baking paper.Put the butter, sugar, eggs, flour, baking powder and orange zest in a large mixing bowl and beat for 2 minutes, or until just blended. (An electric mixer is best for this, but you can beat by hand using a wooden spoon).Divide the mixture evenly between the tins. Level the surface using a spatula or the back of a spoon.Bake for 25 minutes, or until well risen and golden. The tops of the cakes should spring back when pressed lightly with a finger. Leave the cakes to cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then run a small palette knife or rounded butter knife around the edge of the tins and carefully turn the cakes out onto a wire rack. Peel off the paper and leave to cool completely.Choose the cake with the best top, then put the other cake top-down onto a serving plate.Beat together the filling ingredients and spread on one side of the cake, put the other cake on top (top upwards) and spread the rest of the orange cream on top. Decorate with spiralled orange zests.
