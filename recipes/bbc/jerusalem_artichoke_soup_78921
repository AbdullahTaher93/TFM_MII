For the Jerusalem artichoke soup, heat the vegetable oil in a large pan and gently fry the onion and a pinch of salt for 5-6 minutes, or until soft.Meanwhile, cut the artichokes into roughly 2cm/1in cubes. Add them to the onions and fry for a further 3-4 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock and cream and cook over a medium heat until the vegetables are soft. Add the lemon juice and cook for five more minutes.Transfer the cooked vegetables to food processor and blend to a smooth soup. If it is too thick, add a little more stock or water. Taste to check the seasoning and add salt and pepper as required. Keep warm until ready to serve.For the game burger, heat a dash of the olive oil in a frying pan. Once hot, add the onion and gently fry until soft and translucent. Set aside to cool.Put the livers, pork fat, throat (or belly), game and apricots through a mincer, or very finely chop them (alternatively, ask your butcher to do this for you). Add one egg, the cream and breadcrumbs and mix together. If the mixture doesnâ€™t bind together add the other egg. Season with salt and pepper or, to test the seasoning of the burger, roll a small amount into a mini burger, fry and taste.When satisfied with the seasoning, mould the meat into burgers and fry in a large frying pan with the olive oil for 2-3 minutes on each side.For the Jerusalem crisps, fill a deep-fat fryer with vegetable oil and preheat to 180C/350F. (CAUTION: hot can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Dry the slices of artichokes with a clean tea towel and dust with flour. Fry for two minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.Serve the Jerusalem artichoke soup with the game burger in the centre of each of the bowls, garnished with the artichoke crisps, chives and a swirl of olive oil.
