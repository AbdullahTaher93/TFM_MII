For the tempura vegetables, heat a deep fat fryer to 180C/350F. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous do not leave unattended.)Mix the flour, cornflour and salt in a bowl. Whisk in enough sparkling water to form a smooth batter (you may not need all of the water).Dip the vegetables into the batter and carefully lower into the hot oil. Fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden-brown on both sides. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper.For the yuzu dressing, place the egg yolks, vinegar and mustard into a food processor. Blend to combine then, with the motor still running, gradually add the oil.Continue blending until all the oil has been added and the mayonnaise has thickened. Season with the yuzu juice, chilli dipping sauce, salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.To serve, place the vegetables on a serving plate with the yuzu dressing in a dipping bowl. Garnish the vegetables with spring onions, chilli and coriander cress.
