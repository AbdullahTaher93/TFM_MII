Cook the spelt in boiling water until tender (this should take 20â€“25 minutes, but check the packet instructions).  Drain and run cold water through it.  Shake off the excess water and put into a serving bowl with 2 tbsp olive oil, lemon juice and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.Heat the remaining olive oil and cook the onion until it has just lost its rawness, then add the spices and cook for another 2 minutes.  Add this to the spelt. Toast the walnut pieces in the same pan for a minute or so, until they smell aromatic.  Tip them into the bowl along with all the remaining ingredients and gently toss together.For the dressing, mix all of the ingredients together. Check for seasoning.Drizzle the spelt with some of the buttermilk dressing and serve the rest in a jug alongside.
