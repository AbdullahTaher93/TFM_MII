In a large skillet, brown ham steaks on both sides in clarified butter. Add Cognac, ignite it, and shake the pan until the flames go out. Stir in cream and curry powder  and simmer the sauce over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Transfer ham to a heated serving platter and reduce the sauce until it is slightly thickened. Pour the sauce over the ham and sprinkle it with minced parsley.
