Place beans, onion, carrots, and celery in a large pot and add cold water to cover by several inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer very gently until beans are cooked almost all the way through, about 1 1/2 hours. Season with salt and continue to cook, adding more water if needed to keep beans submerged, until tender (outside skin should still be intact), 45â€“60 minutes. Discard onion, carrots, and celery. Transfer beans and broth to a serving dish or a large bowl; season very generously with salt (start with 2 Tbsp.) and pepper and drizzle with oil. Beans can be cooked and seasoned 2 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat gently before serving.
