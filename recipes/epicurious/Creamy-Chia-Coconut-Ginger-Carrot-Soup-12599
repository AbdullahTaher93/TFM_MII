Heat 1/3 cup of the coconut milk in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and salt and cook while stirring until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ginger, curry paste, and garlic and cook while stirring until well combined and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the carrots, 2 3/4 cups of broth, the lime juice, the 15 large cilantro sprigs, and the remaining coconut milk and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until the carrots are very tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the cilantro sprigs and puree soup in batches in a blender, using the hot fill line as a guide. Transfer the pureed soup to a clean saucepan and place over low heat. Stir in 1/4 cup of the chia seeds and simmer uncovered until chia seeds are fully hydrated and soup reaches desired consistency, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Note: If soup becomes thicker than you desire, stir in additional vegetable broth by the tablespoon to reach ideal consistency.) Taste and adjust seasonings, garnish with the remaining 1 teaspoon of chia seeds and small cilantro sprigs, and serve.
