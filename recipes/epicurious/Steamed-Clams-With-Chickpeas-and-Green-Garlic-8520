Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook garlic, stirring, until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add wine, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in cream and lemon juice. Add clams and chickpeas and increase heat to medium-high. Cover and cook, shaking occasionally, until clams open, about 5 minutes; discard any that don’t open. Add crème fraîche and stir until melted into sauce. Add dill and tarragon; season with salt and pepper. Cook about 20 seconds to soften herbs. Top with lemon zest; serve with bread.
