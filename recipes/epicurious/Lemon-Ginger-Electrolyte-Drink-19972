Finely grate ginger and, using a flexible spatula, press solids into a fine-mesh sieve set over a small bowl; discard pulp. You should have about 1 tsp. ginger juice. Combine ginger juice, lemon juice, lime juice, agave, and salt in a large measuring cup or bowl. Stir in mineral water. Pour over 2 glasses filled with ice. Lemon-ginger mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Stir vigorously before adding mineral water.
