Heat the oil in a large saute pan or non-stick wok. Fry the leeks and garlic on a medium heat for 2â€“3 minutes to soften, then add the salt and preserved lemon, and stir to combine. Tip in the Israeli couscous and continue frying for another 2 minutes or until the little couscous balls start to go golden. Add half the boiling water and the peas. Boil until most of the water has soaked in, then add the rest of the water and cook on a high heat until it has also been sucked up by the couscous. Remove from the heat, add the mint and parsley and stir well. Finally crumble the goats' cheese all over and serve.
