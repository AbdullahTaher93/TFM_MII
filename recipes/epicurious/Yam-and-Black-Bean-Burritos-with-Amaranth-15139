Scrub (but don't peel) the yams, cut them into bite-size pieces, and steam in a saucepan or steamer basket until tender but still holding their shape, about 10 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and then add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the jalape√±o pepper and bell peppers and continue cooking for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, until they begin to soften. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then stir in the yams, tomatoes, salsa, beans, cilantro, and lime juice and cook just to heat through, about 3 to 4 more minutes. Finally, add the amaranth, chili powder, and cumin and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in warm tortillas and top with avocado and, if you like, sour cream.
