In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with a pinch of salt until they are frothy. Beat in the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat the egg yolks until they are thick and light. Beat in the dark rum, the tea, and the scalded milk. Transfer the mixture to a heat-proof punch bowl, rinsed first with boiling water.
