Spread melon pieces on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. Freeze until just hard, about 1 hour. Transfer melon pieces to a food processor and add lime juice, sugar, thyme, 1/2 cup water and tequila, if desired. Pulse until smooth and slushy, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally. Add water if you prefer a thinner consistency. Add lime juice and sugar to taste. Divide among serving glasses and garnish with thyme sprigs. Serve immediately with spoons, or let melt slightly to serve as a drink
