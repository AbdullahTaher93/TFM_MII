Wrap 2 cinnamon sticks, allspice, and cloves in cheesecloth and tie with string. Simmer cranberry juice, cider, sugar, and spice bag in a 5-quart heavy pot, uncovered, skimming froth occasionally, 10 minutes. Halve apple and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Add apple slices and Calvados to cider mixture and simmer 2 minutes (slices will remain crisp). Serve hot and garnish with cinnamon sticks.
