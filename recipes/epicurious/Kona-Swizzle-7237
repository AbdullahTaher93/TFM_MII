Gently muddle (or mix with a swizzle stick) 1/4 cup spiced rum (or try Chairman's Reserve Spiced Rum), 4 1/2 teaspoons orgeat syrup (such as Brooklyn Orgeat Works or Monin), 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, 1 teaspoon simple syrup, and 2 mint sprigs in a cocktail shaker. Cover and shake well. Pour into a Pilsner or Collins glass. Fill glass halfway with crushed ice, pushing mint toward bottom of the glass. Stir with a swizzle stick. Top with more crushed ice, mounding over rim of the glass. Top with 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters and 1 dash Angostura bitters. Garnish with 2 mint sprigs.
