Preheat oven to 250°F. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high until shimmering. Season pork all over with salt and pepper and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 12–15 minutes. Pour off excess fat from pot. Add sage, lemon peel, and milk. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover pot and transfer to oven. Roast pork until very tender, 3 1/2–4 hours. Transfer meat to a serving platter. Discard lemon peel, then gently toss Swiss chard in remaining sauce in pot until wilted. Using tongs, transfer Swiss chard to platter alongside pork. Top both with remaining sauce and serve.
