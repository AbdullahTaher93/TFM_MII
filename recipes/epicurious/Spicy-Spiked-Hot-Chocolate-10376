Combine milk, cream, sugar, chile, and cinnamon stick in a medium saucepan; scrape in seeds from vanilla bean and add pod. Bring to a simmer; remove from heat, cover, and let steep 15 minutes. Remove chile, cinnamon stick, and vanilla pod; discard. Add chocolate and heat over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove hot chocolate from heat and add liqueur. Serve hot. DO AHEAD: Hot chocolate (without liqueur) can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat and add liqueur just before serving.
