In a cocktail shaker, muddle the cucumber until slightly broken up, about 20 seconds. Add the absinthe and let macerate for about 30 seconds. Add the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup, then fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a Collins glass (or any tall glass tumbler), top with tonic, and garnish with a cucumber slice.
