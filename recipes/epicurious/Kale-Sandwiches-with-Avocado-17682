In a small jar, combine 2 tablespoons oil, vinegar, mustard, thyme and 1/4 cup water; season with salt and pepper. Cover and shake until well combined. Stack kale leaves and roll into a cigar shape. Slice into thin strips; turn 90 degrees and slice again crosswise until you have what looks like kale confetti. Toss in a bowl with vinaigrette. In a food processor, blend beans, garlic and salt to taste for less than a minute. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil slowly through the feed tube, blending, until mixture is smooth. Stir in Parmesan. Spread 1 slice whole-grain bread with 1/4 bean spread; top with 1/4 kale, 1/4 avocado and another bread slice. Repeat with remaining bread, spread, kale and avocado.
