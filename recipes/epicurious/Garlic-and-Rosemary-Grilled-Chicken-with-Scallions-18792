Prepare grill for medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place rosemary, garlic, and 1 bunch of scallions in a layer on grill. Place chicken, skin side up, on top of aromatics. Cover grill and cook until chicken is nearly cooked through, 35–40 minutes (aromatics will be thoroughly charred). Brush chicken with 1 tablespoon oil and place skin side down, directly onto grates (you can discard aromatics at this point). Grill until chicken is cooked through and skin is crisp, 10–15 minutes longer. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before cutting into pieces. Meanwhile, toss remaining bunch of scallions with remaining 1 tablespoon oil on a rimmed baking sheet and grill until tender and lightly charred, about 5 minutes. Serve chicken with grilled scallions alongside, topped with onion blossoms, if desired.
