Trim both ends off the lemon, then stand it on a cut side and use a sharp paring knife to cut off the peel, including the white pith; discard the peel. Cut the segments free from the membranes. Feed the lemon segments, apple, celery, kale, and parsley through a juicer. Stir in the turmeric and serve immediately.
