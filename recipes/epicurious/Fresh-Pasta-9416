Combine durum wheat flour and semolina flour in a large bowl. Bring a small saucepan of water to a bare simmer. Add 2/3 cup hot water to flours and mix with a fork until mixture just comes together. Turn out dough onto a surface lightly dusted with durum wheat flour and knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes (alternatively, using a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix on low speed, about 5 minutes). Wrap tightly in plastic wrap; let sit 1 hour at room temperature. DO AHEAD: Pasta dough can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap tightly and chill.
