In a saucepan combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon water, the molasses, and the ginger, and bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring. Add the milk in a stream, whisking, and heat the mixture over moderate heat, stirring until it is hot, but do not let it boil. Stir in the rum, divide the mixture between 2 heated mugs, and sprinkle each drink with some of the nutmeg.
