In a blender, puree tomatoes, stock, onion, cumin, garlic and chile until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. In an 8" nonstick pan over medium-high heat, heat oil. Pour tomato mixture into pan; season with salt and cook until sauce reduces by half, 3 minutes. Add beans and cook, 2 minutes. Break eggs into the tomato mixture so they don't touch sides; reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until egg whites are set and yolks are runny, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve on tortillas and top with cheese, avocado and cilantro, plus lime for garnish.
