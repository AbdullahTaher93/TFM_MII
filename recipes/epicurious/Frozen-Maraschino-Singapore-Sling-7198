In a blender, blend together gin, kirsch, Benedictine, cognac, cherries, cherry juice, lime juice, sugar, club soda and 2 cups cracked ice, scraping down the sides occasionally, until the mixture is smooth but still frozen. Divide the mixture between 2 stemmed glasses, and spoon the Port over the drinks.
