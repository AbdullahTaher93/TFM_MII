Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Crack 2 eggs into skillet; season with salt. Cook until whites set around yolk and are golden around the edges but yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Transfer fried eggs to a plate. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in same skillet. Add rice and cook, stirring, until grains no longer stick together, about 2 minutes. Toss in 1/4 cup dressing; season with salt. Divide rice between bowls and top with roasted broccoli, a fried egg, some nori mayonnaise, avocado, and cilantro. Drizzle with more dressing.
