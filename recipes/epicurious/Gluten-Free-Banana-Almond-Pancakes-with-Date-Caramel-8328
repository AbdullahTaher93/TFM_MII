Soak chopped dates in 1 cup hot water for 15 minutes. Transfer dates and their soaking liquid to a blender or food processor; add vanilla extract and salt. Blend until date mixture reaches a caramel-like consistency, adding a bit more hot water if needed. Transfer date caramel to a small serving bowl or creamer. In a large bowl, mash the bananas and whisk in the milk, eggs, and vanilla. In another large bowl, combine the almond meal, brown rice flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir well to incorporate. Heat a large skillet or griddle to medium and brush it with a bit of butter. Drop batter by the tablespoon into the skillet to form pancakes. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until light brown, about 30 seconds more. Repeat with remaining batter, brushing pan with butter as needed. Drizzle pancakes with date caramel, sprinkle with almonds, and serve.
