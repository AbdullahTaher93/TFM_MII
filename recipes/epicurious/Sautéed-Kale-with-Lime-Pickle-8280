Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring often, until beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Working in batches, add kale, tossing and letting it cook down slightly before adding another handful or two, and adding a splash of water if pan looks dry. Add lime pickle and cook, tossing often, until kale is wilted and tender, 5â€“8 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
