Place onion in a small heatproof bowl. Bring vinegar and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Pour over onion and let cool. Drain onion and place in a medium bowl; add preserved lemon, cilantro, mint, parsley, and dill and toss to combine. Drizzle lightly with oil, season with salt, and toss again to coat.
