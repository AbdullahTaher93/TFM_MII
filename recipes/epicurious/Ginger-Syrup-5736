Wash the ginger well in hot water. Using a Microplane zester, grate the ginger, carefully reserving the juice and pulp. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, bring the water and sugar to a gentle boil. Add the ginger and lemon zest, and remove the pan from the heat. Cover the pan and steep for about 45 minutes. Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer and let cool. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 14 days.
