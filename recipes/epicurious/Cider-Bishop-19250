Stud the orange with cloves and roast in a 350Â°F oven for 30 minutes. Remove, cut into quarters, and place in a heavy saucepan with the honey and cider. Heat for 20 minutes without letting cider come to a boil. Pour an ounce of brandy or applejack into six warmed 6-ounce mugs and fill with the hot cider.
