Cook the quinoa according to the package instructions. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, then stir in the quinoa, Parmesan, herbs, pepper, green onions or garlic
scapes, and mushrooms. Coat a medium, ovenproof skillet with a thick layer of olive oil. Place over medium high heat, add the egg mixture, and sprinkle with the olives. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes without stirring. Preheat the broiler with the rack in the second position from the top. Broil the frittata until the top is lightly browned and the eggs have firmed up in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the frittata from the oven and let it rest for 3 minutes. Loosen the edges with a spatula and cut into 6 wedges. Serve immediately.
