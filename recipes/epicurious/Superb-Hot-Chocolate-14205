Melt chocolate bits in a double boiler over hot water and stir in the cream. Heat just to boiling point, stirring constantly. Add the cinnamon and serve in 8-ounce chocolate cups topped with flavored whipped cream. For mint flavored chocolate, place a mint patty in the bottom of each cup before pouring in the hot chocolate. For a less rich drink, use half milk and half cream, or plain whole milk in place of the heavy cream. To vary the drink and make it slightly alcoholic, use 1 to 2 dashes Grand Marnier instead of cinnamon.
