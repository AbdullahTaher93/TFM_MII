Finely grate bottom third of lemongrass into a blender or food processor; discard remaining lemongrass (or save for making stock). Add chiles, shallot, garlic, ginger, turmeric, kaffir lime leaf (if using), coriander, cumin, salt, and sugar; blend or process until smooth. Curry paste can be made 3 months ahead. Portion into small plastic bags or airtight containers and freeze.
