Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, 8–10 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, place dates in a small bowl and add 1/2 cup hot water to cover; soak 10 minutes to soften. Blend walnuts, dates with their soaking liquid, cinnamon, and salt in a blender until a coarse paste forms. Add ice cream and 3/4 cup cracked ice and blend until smooth. Divide shake between 2 glasses.
