In a bowl, combine the black rice, oranges, orange juice, pumpkin seeds, orange zest, salt, and chipotle. Gently mix in the avocado. Add more salt, if needed. Place a lettuce cup on each plate and spoon the salad into the lettuce cups. Garnish with orange wedges, if you wish. A very high-quality Chinese black rice is distributed by Lotus Foods under the registered trademark name "Forbidden Black Rice." This rice bleeds beetÂ­red when you rinse it and, once cooked, ends up a striking deep burgundy. It holds its shape very well and is pleasantly chewy. With a subtle sweetness and a rich taste, it's a stunning rice that has everything going for it. Put it high on your list of rices to try. Rinse the rice. Combine the rice, water, and salt (if using) in a heavy Dutch oven or saucepan. Over high heat, bring to a boil. Skim off any foam floating on the surface. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer until the rice is tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Quickly drain off any excess water. Return the rice to the hot pot, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes.
