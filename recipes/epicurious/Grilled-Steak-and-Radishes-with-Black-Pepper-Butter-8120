Prepare grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil grill grate. Mix butter, 1 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl; set aside. Season steak with kosher salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, 7-10 minutes for medium-rare. Let rest 5 minutes, then top with pepper butter. Meanwhile, combine radishes and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium bowl; season with kosher salt and pepper and toss to coat. Grill radishes until crisp tender, about 2 minutes per side. Season steak with sea salt, slice, and serve with radishes and lemon wedges.
