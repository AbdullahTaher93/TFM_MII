Kefir sauce: Stir kefir, honey, and salt in a small bowl; cover and chill. Toast seeds in a dry small skillet over medium-high, tossing occasionally, until fragrant and coriander seeds start to pop, about 3 minutes. Let cool; finely grind in spice mill. Pur√©e spice mix, watercress, broth, and salt in a blender until smooth. Cover and chill until ready to use. Toast caraway in a dry large skillet over medium-high, tossing, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Let cool; finely grind in spice mill. Cook scallions in same skillet, turning occasionally, until charred, 5 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop. Reserve skillet. Process caraway, scallions, chile, garlic, bread, ricotta, lentils, broth, onion powder, paprika, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a food processor to a paste (some larger pieces of lentils should still be visible). Form into 12 balls. Pour oil into a large heavy skillet to a depth of 1/2" and heat over medium-high until oil bubbles immediately when a pinch of lentil mixture is added. Working in batches if needed, cook croquettes until deep golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; season with salt. Swirl both sauces in bowls; top with croquettes. Drizzle with pomegranate molasses and finish with watercress. Do ahead: Croquettes can be formed 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before frying.
