Set aside 4 raspberries for garnish. Combine remaining raspberries, milk, malted milk powder, and sugar in blender; blend until smooth. Add ice cream; blend until smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down sides of blender, if necessary. Pour malted shake into fluted soda-fountain style glass. Top with sorbet. Garnish malt with reserved berries.
