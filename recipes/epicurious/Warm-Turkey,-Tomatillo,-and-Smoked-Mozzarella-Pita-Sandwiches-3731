Preheat oven to 350° F. Split pita loaves horizontally to create 4 rounds. Discard husks from tomatillos and rinse under warm water. Chop tomatillos and in a blender purée with jalapeño, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. In a small saucepan cook purée over moderate heat, stirring, until thickened, about 4 minutes. Spread 1/4 tomatillo purée on rough side of each pita round. Arrange 2 pita rounds on a baking sheet and top evenly with turkey, roasted pepper, mozzarella, and coriander. Top with remaining pita rounds, tomatillo sides down. Brush tops of sandwiches with oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake sandwiches in middle of oven 10 minutes, or until cheese is slightly melted and tops of pitas are golden brown. Cut sandwiches into wedges if desired.
