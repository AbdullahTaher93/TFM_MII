Tear 8 ounces burrata into pieces (or use bocconcini) and place on a platter. Toss 2 thinly sliced watermelon radishes with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Arrange radish mixture over burrata and drizzle with any remaining dressing. Top with chopped chives and finely grated lemon zest.
