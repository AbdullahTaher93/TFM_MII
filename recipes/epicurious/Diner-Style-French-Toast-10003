Whisk eggs, milk, granulated sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Heat a large griddle or 2 cast-iron or nonstick skillets over medium. Brush with a thin coating of oil, then a thin coating of butter. Working in batches, dip each slice of bread into egg mixture. Cook, flipping halfway through, until golden brown on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining bread, brushing griddle with remaining oil and butter as needed. Dust French toast with powdered sugar just before serving. Serve with maple syrup alongside.
