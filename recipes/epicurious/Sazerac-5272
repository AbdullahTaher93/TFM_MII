Place 1 sugar cube in a mixing glass. Add 2 dashes Angostura bitters and 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters, then 1 ounce rye whiskey and 1 ounce VSOP Cognac. Muddle until sugar dissolves. Fill glass with ice and stir until very cold, about 30 seconds. Rinse a brandy snifter with 1 teaspoon absinthe; discard. Strain cocktail through a Hawthorne strainer or a slotted spoon into snifter. Garnish with 3 star anise pods.
