Mix the sesame seeds and red pepper flakes on a plate, then press the salmon fillets into the mixture to coat. Heat half the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, add the salmon, and cook for 3–4 minutes on each side, until cooked through. Remove from the skillet and keep warm. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over high heat, add the vegetables, and stir-fry for 3–4 minutes, until just cooked. Drizzle the soy sauce over the vegetables and serve with the salmon and basmati rice.
