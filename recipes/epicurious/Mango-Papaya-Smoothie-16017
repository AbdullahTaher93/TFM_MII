In a blender blend the mango, the papaya, the yogurt, the lime juice, the honey, the almond extract and 1 cup ice cubes in batches until the mixture is smooth and blend in another 1/2 cup ice cubes if desired to thin the smoothie mixture to desired consistency. Divide the mixture among 4 chilled large glasses and garnish each smoothie with a lime slice.
