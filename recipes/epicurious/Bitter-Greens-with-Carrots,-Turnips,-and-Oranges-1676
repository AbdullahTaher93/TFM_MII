Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, 8–10 minutes. Let cool; coarsely chop. Whisk vinegar, lemon juice, shallot, and mustard in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, gradually add oil. Whisk until emulsified; season vinaigrette with kosher salt and pepper. Stir in thyme. Toss watercress, radicchio, carrots, turnips, oranges, kumquats (if using), and toasted walnuts in a large bowl. Drizzle with vinaigrette, season with sea salt and pepper, and toss again to coat.
