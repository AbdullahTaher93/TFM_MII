Preheat oven to 250Â°F. Grate peel from oranges onto baking sheet lined with parchment (reserve oranges to moisten rims of glasses). Bake until peel is dry, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Mix peel, sugar, and cinnamon in bowl; mash to infuse. Cover mixture. Combine vodka and 2 cups grapes in pitcher. Using potato masher, crush grapes to coarse pulp. Add grape juice. Chill until cold, at least 8 hours. Moisten rims of 6 Martini glasses with cut sides of reserved oranges; dip into infused sugar. Thread 3 grapes onto each of 6 long toothpicks; divide among glasses. Strain vodka; add 1/4 cup to each glass. Top off with Champagne.
