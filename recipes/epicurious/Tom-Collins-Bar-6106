Combine gin, lemon juice, and sugar in a pitcher or large measuring glass and stir to dissolve sugar; refrigerate gin mixture if not making drinks right away. Gin mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. When ready to serve, arrange lemon wedges, mango, cucumber, mint sprigs, ginger, raspberries, and strawberries on a platter or in separate bowls and set out alongside gin mixture, club soda, and a bucket of ice. For each cocktail, muddle ingredients of your choice (mix and match!) in a Collins glass. Fill with ice, then add 1/4 cup gin mixture and top off with club soda.
