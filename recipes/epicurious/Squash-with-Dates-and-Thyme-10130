Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Toss squash, thyme, garlic, olive oil, and coconut oil in a large baking dish; season with kosher salt and pepper. Roast, tossing occasionally, until just tender, 40-45 minutes. Add dates; toss to coat. Roast until squash are very tender and dates are soft, 12-15 minutes. Arrange squash, dates, garlic, and thyme on a platter, spoon any oil in dish over squash, and sprinkle with sea salt.
