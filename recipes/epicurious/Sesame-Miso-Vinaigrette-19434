Sprinkle the sesame seeds into a small skillet over medium heat. Cook, shaking the pan frequently, until the sesame seeds have darkened and become fragrant, just a few minutes. Immediately transfer them to a plate to cool; if you leave them to cool in the pan, they can burn. Use a fork to whisk the miso and sesame oil in a small jar fitted with a lid until smooth. Add the vinegar, vegetable oil, sesame seeds, and honey, close the lid tightly, and vigorously shake to emulsify the dressing. Taste and add more honey if desired, plus salt, and shake again. Store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
