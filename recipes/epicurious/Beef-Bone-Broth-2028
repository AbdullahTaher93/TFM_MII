Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. On a baking sheet or two, spread out the knuckle bones, femur bones, short ribs, and oxtail in an even layer and roast in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown. On a separate baking sheet, spread out all the vegetables in an even layer and roast in the oven for 15 minutes. When the bones are roasted, transfer them to a stockpot or slow cooker, cover with the water, and add the vinegar if desired. If using a stockpot, place the pot on the stovetop over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. If using a slow cooker, set the temperature to high: reduce heat to low after broth starts to boil. Skim off the fat and scum that rises to the surface and, if you wish to save the fat for future use as a cooking fat, pass it through a strainer into a storage container. Continue the skimming process for a few hours as the fat and scum rise to the surface. Continue simmering for up to 24 hours, skimming as necessary. Add the vegetables and herbs to the stockpot or slow cooker when you have about 5 hours left on your intended cook time. Gently strain or ladle the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a container. Fill your sink with ice water. Place the container of broth in the ice bath to cool for about 1 hour. Use the broth right away, or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 1 year.
