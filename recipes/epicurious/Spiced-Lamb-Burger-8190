Using a fork, mix lamb, onion, parsley, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup oil in a large bowl. Cover and chill at least 1 hour. Prepare grill for medium heat and oil grate. Working one at a time, open each pita pocket by cutting along seam, halfway around perimeter. Spoon filling into pitas, spreading to edges. Close, pressing on filling to seal. Grill pitas until filling is cooked through and bread is crisp, about 5 minutes per side. Do ahead: Filling can be made 8 hours ahead. Keep chilled. Pita breads can be stuffed 1 hour ahead; cover and chill.
