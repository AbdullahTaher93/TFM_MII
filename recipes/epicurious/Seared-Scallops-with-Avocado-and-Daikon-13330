Toss daikon, vinegar, and yuzu juice in a medium bowl; season with salt. Set aside. Season scallops with salt. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat until almost smoking. Add scallops and cook until seared and golden brown but still raw in the center, about 2 minutes per side; transfer to a plate. Let cool slightly, then slice each scallop crosswise into 3 rounds. Divide avocado among plates; drizzle with lemon juice and season with salt. Set scallops on avocado and dab them with yuzu kosho. Drizzle grapefruit juice and oil over, top with grapefruit zest, and season with salt. Arrange reserved daikon over scallops.
