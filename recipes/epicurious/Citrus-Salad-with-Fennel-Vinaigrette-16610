Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk egg white in a small bowl until slightly foamy; whisk in sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Add sesame seeds and toss to coat. Spoon sesame mixture in clumps on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Let cool. DO AHEAD: Sesame clusters can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add chopped fennel, shallot, ginger, and fennel seeds and cook, stirring often, until tender (do not let brown), 8–10 minutes. Mix in vinegar and honey. Let cool; season with salt and pepper. Finely grate 1 teaspoon zest from 1 orange; set aside. Using a sharp knife, cut all peel and white pith from all oranges; discard. Cut between membranes to release segments into a medium bowl; discard membranes. Toss greens, parsley, fennel fronds, oranges, and dressing in a large bowl. Serve topped with sesame clusters and reserved orange zest. DO AHEAD: Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
