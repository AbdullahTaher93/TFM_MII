Using zester or paring knife, slice peel from lemon in long, thin spiral. Reserve lemon for another use and set peel aside. In cocktail shaker, combine gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup. Add ice and shake vigorously for 20 seconds. Strain into chilled Champagne flute and top with sparkling wine. Curl lemon peel around finger to create twist at least 6 inches long. Garnish drink with twist and serve immediately.
