To make the pomegranate dressing, place the oil, pomegranate molasses, garlic, salt and pepper in a bowl. Whisk to combine and set aside. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the pumpkin, onion, oil, pomegranate molasses, paprika, chile, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and toss to combine. Transfer to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and roast for 30 minutes or until golden and crisp. Place the spelt, mint, parsley and half the pomegranate seeds in a large bowl. Add the dressing and toss to combine. Divide between serving plates and top with the pumpkin and onion. Sprinkle with feta and the remaining pomegranate seeds to serve.
