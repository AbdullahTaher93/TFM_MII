Heat oven to 325°F. Lightly oil two 5x2 1/2" loaf pans (or one 8 1/2x4 1/2" loaf pan). Whisk flour, cornmeal, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, add eggs, milk, molasses, and 1/4 cup oil; whisk in dry ingredients. Divide batter between pans. Sprinkle with maple sugar. Bake breads until golden and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 40–45 minutes for small loaves (50–55 minutes for large loaf). Transfer pans to a wire rack and let breads cool 10 minutes before turning out. DO AHEAD: Breads can be made 1 day ahead. Store wrapped tightly at room temperature.
