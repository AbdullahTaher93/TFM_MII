Bring ginger, 2/3 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce to a simmer; cook until liquid thickens to maple syrup consistency, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool. Strain syrup; discard ginger. Combine Chinese five-spice powder and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar on a shallow plate. Moisten the rim of Champagne flutes with water and dip in sugar. Drop 1 teaspoon crystallized ginger and 1 star anise into each glass. Add 1 tablespoon syrup and about 3 ounces Champagne.
