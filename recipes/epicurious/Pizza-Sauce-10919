In a medium saucepan over low heat, saute the garlic in the oil for 1 to 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the onion, salt and pepper, and pepper flakes, and turn up the heat slightly. Stir until the onions have softened, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and oregano. Stir, bring to a boil, and then simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. (But 20 minutes is fine, too, if the kids are losing it.) If you have basil, definitely add a few shreds during the last 5 minutes that it simmers.
