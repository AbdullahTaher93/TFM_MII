In a small saucepan, cook couscous according to package directions, seasoning it with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Once cooked, drain the couscous and transfer to a medium bowl. While the couscous is cooking, drizzle 1 tablespoon oil over both sides of fish fillets and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Rub each side of each fillet with 1 teaspoon za'atar. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, and add 1 tablespoon oil. Once the oil is hot, add fish to skillet, skin-side down, and sear until skin is golden brown and crispy, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip fish and cook until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer fish to a rimmed baking sheet or plate. Add chard stems and wine to pan; cook for 30 seconds. Stir in chard leaves, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to skillet. Cover and cook until chard leaves are wilted, 2 to 3 minutes more. Add chard mixture to bowl with couscous. Fold in pomegranate seeds, olives, feta, and remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Squeeze lemon half over the mixture and toss to combine; taste and adjust seasoning. Divide couscous mixture among four plates and top with fish fillets, skin-side up.
