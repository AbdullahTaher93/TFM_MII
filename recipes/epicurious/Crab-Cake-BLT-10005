Combine egg yolk, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, scallions, parsley, tarragon, lemon zest, Tabasco, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper. Gently fold in crabmeat, trying not to break up the crab. Pour cornmeal onto a plate. Shape crab mixture into 4 cakes; dredge in cornmeal to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry cakes for about 5 minutes on each side until golden brown. Stir Sriracha into remaining 1/2 cup mayonnaise. Spread on bun; layer bacon, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and crab cake.
