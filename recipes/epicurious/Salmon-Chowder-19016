Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the potatoes, leeks, and mushrooms. Saut√© the vegetables until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to stir for 1 minute. Add the white wine and simmer until most of the liquid has cooked off. Stir in the tomatoes, fish or vegetable stock, half and half, yogurt, parsley, and dill and bring to a low simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the salmon and simmer until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Ladle into bowls and garnish with drops of half and half and parsley or dill, if desired.
