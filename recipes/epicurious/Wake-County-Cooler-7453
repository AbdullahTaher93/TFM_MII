Combine one 750-milliliter bottle vodka and 2/3 cup loose-leaf black tea in a large pitcher. Let sit at room temperature, stirring occasionally, 2 hours. Strain into another large pitcher. Combine 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in a jar, cover, and shake until sugar is dissolved; mix into vodka. For each cooler, fill a Collins glass with ice. Add 2 ounces infused vodka and 1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice. Top with club soda and garnish with a lemon wedge and a mint sprig.
