Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease loaf pan with nonstick spray. Mix bananas, ice cream, flour, and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake bread, rotating pan halfway through, until top is golden brown and center is set, 55–60 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let bread cool completely. Run a butter knife around perimeter of pan to loosen loaf, then tap pan gently on its side until loaf releases. Transfer to a cutting board and slice. Bread can be baked, cooled, then wrapped in plastic and left at room temperature up to 3 days, or frozen up to 3 months.
