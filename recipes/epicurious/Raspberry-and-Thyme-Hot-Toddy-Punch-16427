Bring 10 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Reduce heat and bring to a simmer. Add tea bags, lemon and orange slices, sugar, cloves, and 12 thyme sprigs; simmer, covered, 10 minutes. Remove from heat; discard tea bags. Stir in raspberry liqueur, whiskey, and lemon juice. Divide among mugs and garnish with thyme sprigs, if desired.
