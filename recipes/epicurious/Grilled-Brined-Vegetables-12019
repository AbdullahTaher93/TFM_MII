Bring bay leaves, peppercorns, vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes, 2 Tbsp. salt, and 3 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan. Simmer carrots or beets in brine until crisp-tender, 8–10 minutes for carrots, 25–30 minutes for beets. For radishes, simply add to brine off heat and let cool. Remove vegetables; pat dry. (Save brine to pickle another batch of vegetables.) Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Toss brined vegetables with oil in a large bowl; season lightly with salt. Grill, turning occasionally, until lightly charred in spots, 6–8 minutes. Serve with Green Chile Charmoula, Spiced Seed Sprinkle, or Grilled Halloumi With Watercress, if desired.
