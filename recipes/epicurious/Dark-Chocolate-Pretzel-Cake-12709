Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Lightly grease and line a 9-inch round springform pan with non-stick parchment paper. Place the butter and chocolate in a large bowl over a pot of simmering water and stir until melted and smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and set aside. Place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar and whisk until the mixture is thick and glossy. Add the egg yolks and salt to the chocolate mixture and stir to combine. In 3 batches, gently fold the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture until just combined. Pour into the pan and arrange the pretzels on top. Bake for 25 minutes or until the edges are cooked when tested with a skewer and the center is just set. Refrigerate for 3 hours or until chilled. Slice to serve.
