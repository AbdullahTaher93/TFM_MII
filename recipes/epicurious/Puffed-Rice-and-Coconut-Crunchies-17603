Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Toss puffed rice, coconut flakes, coconut oil, brown rice syrup, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and paprika on a rimmed baking sheet until rice and coconut are evenly coated. Season with salt and roast until coconut is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Let cool. Crunchies can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill.
