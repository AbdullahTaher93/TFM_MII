Preheat oven to 450°F. Place orange slices and sugar in a small bowl. Scrape in vanilla seeds; save pod for another use. Toss to coat orange slices. Mix butter, cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and 2 Tbsp. maple syrup in a medium bowl to combine. Spread cinnamon butter on one side of each piece of brioche. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in oven until brioche is golden brown (the bottoms should be very crisp), 8–10 minutes. Place each toast, buttered side down, on plates. Top with crème fraîche and orange slices. Drizzle remaining 1 cup maple syrup over toasts and finish with a sprinkle of salt.
