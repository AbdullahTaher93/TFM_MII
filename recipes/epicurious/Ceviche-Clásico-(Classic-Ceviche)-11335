Cut the fish into 3/4-inch cubes, place in a bowl, and season with salt and pepper. After 1 minute, add the garlic and limo chile. Mix together well. Pour over the lemon juice and add the chopped cilantro leaves and ice cubes. Stir and let stand for a few seconds. Add the red onion and remove the ice cubes. Mix together and adjust the seasoning to taste. Serve in a large shallow bowl with cooked corn kernels and boiled sweet potato slices.
