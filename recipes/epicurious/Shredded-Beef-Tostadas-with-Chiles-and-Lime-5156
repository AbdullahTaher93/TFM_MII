Fill a large pot with 12 cups water; stir in 6 Tbsp. salt. Add beef, onion, garlic, peppercorns, cumin, and cloves. Bring to a simmer and cook, partially covered, until beef shreds easily with a fork, 1 1/2–2 hours. Drain, then transfer to a large bowl and let cool. Using 2 forks or your fingers, coarsely shred beef. Season with salt. Add onion, lime juice, pineapple juice, and oregano to beef mixture and mix well. Season with salt. Let sit at least 1 hour at room temperature or chill up to 1 day. Stir in radishes, chiles, cilantro, and chives just before using. If frying tortillas, fit a large skillet with candy or deep-fry thermometer; pour in oil to measure 1". Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 375°F. Fry tortillas in batches until crispy, turning every 30 seconds, about 2 minutes total. Drain on paper towel-lined baking sheets and season with salt. Spread 1 Tbsp. Creamy Black Bean Spread on a tostada shell. Top with 1/4 cup beef salad, then lettuce, Quick Pickled Onions, radishes, avocado, crema, queso fresco, and salsa. Repeat with remaining tostada shells. Serve at room temperature. Beef salad can be chilled for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature and stir in radishes, chiles, cilantro, and chives just before using.
