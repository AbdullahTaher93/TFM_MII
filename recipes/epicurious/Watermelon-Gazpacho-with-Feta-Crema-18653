Purée watermelon, tomato, cucumber, jalapeño, oil, and vinegar in a blender until smooth. Transfer gazpacho to a large bowl; season with kosher salt and pepper. Cover and chill at least 1 hour before serving. Do ahead: Gazpacho can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Preheat oven to 350°. Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, about 8–10 minutes. (Alternatively, you can do this step in a dry small skillet over medium heat.) Let almonds cool, then coarsely chop. Mash feta into sour cream in a small bowl until mostly smooth, then whisk in milk. Divide watermelon and cucumber among bowls and pour gazpacho over. Top with crema and almonds, drizzle with oil, and season with sea salt and pepper. Do ahead: Crema can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
