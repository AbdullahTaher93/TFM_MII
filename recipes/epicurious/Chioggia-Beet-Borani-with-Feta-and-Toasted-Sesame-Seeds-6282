Preheat oven to 350°F. Rub beets with 1 teaspoon olive oil and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Roast on a baking sheet until tender, about 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool, then peel. Cut the beets into medium chunks and set aside. Toast the cumin seeds in a dry skillet until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes, then grind into a powder, preferably with a mortal and pestle. In a small sauté pan over medium low heat, heat 2 teaspoons olive oil and sweat garlic and shallot until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. In a blender or a food processor, combine the beets, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cumin, garlic, shallot, yogurt, and lime. Continue pulsing until very smooth. This recipe yields about 2 cups. Spoon borani into a serving bowl. Sprinkle with feta, sesame seeds, and finishing sea salt and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Serve with baguette or crackers.
