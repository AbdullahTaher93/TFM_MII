Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced onion and sauté until very tender and beginning to color, about 10 minutes. Add herbs and sauté 1 minute. Add whipping cream and vodka and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 8 minutes. Add pasta and cheese and toss until sauce coats pasta. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
