Bring wine, brandy, apple cider, star anise, cloves, and 2 cinnamon sticks to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors are infused, about 15 minutes. Divide among mugs, garnish with 6 cinnamon sticks, if using, and serve. Mulled wine can be made 2 hours ahead; cover and store at room temperature, or chill up to 3 days. Rewarm over medium-low heat before serving.
