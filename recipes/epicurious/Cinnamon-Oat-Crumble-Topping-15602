Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Add butter and work into dry mixture with your fingertips until pea-sized lumps form. Add oats and mix with your fingertips until clumps form; it should look like crumb topping. Chill 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to a parchment-lined sheet tray and bake 8 minutes. Using a metal spatula, stir and toss crumble. Rotate tray and continue to bake until crumble is dark golden brown, about 8 minutes more. Let cool.
