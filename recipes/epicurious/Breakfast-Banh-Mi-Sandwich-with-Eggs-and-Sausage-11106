In a large bowl, combine all of the sausage ingredients except for the ground pork until evenly mixed. Add the pork and mix, using your hands, until the mixture is combined. Form into eight patties, using 1/3 cup pork mixture per patty. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Working in two batches, cook the sausage patties until cooked through and lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side, adding 1 tablespoon oil for the second batch. Set sausage patties aside on a plate and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the skillet. Heat the skillet to medium-high and fry the eggs in batches until desired doneness. Spread the baguette halves open like a book, and spread insides with mayonnaise. Spread the top side with sambal, if desired. Place 2 fried eggs on the bottom side of each sandwich, and top with 2 sausage patties. Garnish with avocado, jalape√±o, cilantro, and mint and serve.
