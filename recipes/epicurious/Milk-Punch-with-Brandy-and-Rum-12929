In a heavy saucepan, combine the milk, light cream, brandy, dark rum, and sugar. Heat the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is hot. Pour the mixture into a heat-proof punch bowl, rinsed with boiling water beforehand, and garnish the punch with grated nutmeg.
