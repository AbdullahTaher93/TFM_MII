Process 4 ounces room-temperature cream cheese, 4 ounces room-temperature feta, crumbled, and 2 tablespoons room-temperature unsalted butter in a food processor until smooth. Pulse in 2 tablespoons capers, 2 tablespoons oregano leaves, 2 teaspoons toasted fennel seeds, and 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest; season with salt. Scrape into a small plastic wrap-lined bowl; gather up plastic around cheese, shaping into a ball. Chill until firm, 3-12 hours. Unwrap cheese ball and roll in 3/4 cup chopped toasted pine nuts just before serving. Serve with crackers.
