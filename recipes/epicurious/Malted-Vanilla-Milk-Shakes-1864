Place two 12-ounce (or larger) glasses in freezer to chill 1 hour. Pour milk into blender. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; discard bean. Cover and blend 15 seconds. Add ice cream and malted milk powder and blend until thick and creamy, stopping to push down ice cream as necessary. Divide milk shake between chilled glasses. Top each with crushed malted milk balls and serve.
