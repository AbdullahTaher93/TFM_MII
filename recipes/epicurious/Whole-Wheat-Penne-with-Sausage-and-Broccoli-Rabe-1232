1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. 2. Place the broccoli rabe in a large microwaveable dish with 1 tablespoon of water. Cover tightly and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. 3. Spread the pine nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 5 minutes, or until they are fragrant and golden brown. 4. Set a large pot of water to boil for the pasta. When boiling, add the pasta and cook according to the directions on the box. Drain. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over a medium flame. Add the sausage and cook for 5 or 6 minutes, until brown. Remove the sausage from the skillet and slice into 1/4-inch rounds. 5. Add the remaining oil to the skillet and sauté the garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the broccoli rabe and sliced sausage, and sautéfor about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth, crushed red pepper, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer on a low heat until pasta is ready. 6. Combine the drained pasta with the sausage-broccoli rabe mixture and the pine nuts in a large bowl or pot. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.
