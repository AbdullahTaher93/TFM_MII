Place the amaranth, dukkah and salt on a small tray and toss to combine. Dip each salmon fillet in the egg and press into the dukkah mixture to coat. Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Cook the salmon, turning every 3–4 minutes, for 10–12 minutes or until just cooked through and the crumb is golden. Place the chilli, extra oil, lime juice, garlic, cilantro, salt and pepper in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Add the snow pea tendrils and cucumber and toss to coat. Divide the salmon and salad between serving plates and top with chervil to serve.
