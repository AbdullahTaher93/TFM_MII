Place beef in freezer to make it easier to thinly slice. Set a medium pot of salted water to boil. Meanwhile, heat a large pot over medium-high; add ginger, garlic, star anise, cinnamon, and cloves. Toast the spices tossing them constantly, until lightly browned and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Immediately add broth, cover, and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Use a slotted spoon, spider strainer, or small sieve to remove ginger, garlic, and spices from broth; discard. Add fish sauce to broth and taste; season with a little salt and an additional 1/2 teaspoon fish sauce, if desired. Cover pho broth and keep at a gentle simmer. Add noodles to the medium pot of boiling water; cook according to package directions. Drain noodles and divide among four bowls. Remove beef from freezer and slice as thinly as possible. Add kale and mushrooms to broth and simmer until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sliced beef and simmer until just barely cooked, 20 to 30 seconds (it will continue to cook in soup). Using tongs, divide beef among bowls. Ladle broth, kale, and mushrooms into bowls over noodles. Garnish with your choice of toppings, and serve right away.
