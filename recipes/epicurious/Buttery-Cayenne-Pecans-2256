Preheat oven to 300°F. Whisk butter, Worcestershire sauce, salt, garlic powder, mustard powder, hot sauce, and cayenne in a medium bowl. Add pecans and toss to coat. Spread out in a single layer in a large cast-iron skillet or on a rimmed baking sheet and roast, tossing occasionally, until pecans are well toasted and spices are fragrant, 25–30 minutes. These are pretty great served warm, or let cool. Pecans can be made 2 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
