Bring a 6- to 8-quart pasta pot of water to a rolling boil and season generously with salt. Meanwhile, peel the garlic cloves, leaving them whole, then cut them lengthwise into thin slices. Cook the garlic slices in the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the oil bubbles, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the garlic slowly, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the red pepper and remove the pan from the heat (the garlic will continue to cook in the residual heat). Add the pasta to the boiling salted water and cook it, stirring once or twice in the beginning, according to the package instructions. About 4 to 5 minutes before the pasta is done (depending on how tender your broccoli rabe is), stir in the broccoli rabe and continue to boil the mixture, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente and the broccoli rabe is tender. Drain the pasta mixture in a colander and transfer it to a large serving bowl. Spoon the garlic/oil mixture over the pasta and drizzle it with additional olive oil to taste.
