Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Toss onion, bell peppers, and scallions with oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and black pepper. Grill vegetables until lightly charred and tender, about 2 minutes for scallions and 10 minutes for onion and bell peppers. Transfer to a cutting board as they are done; let cool. Slice onion into 1" wedges; place in a medium bowl and toss with lime juice. Remove skins from bell peppers, then cut into bite-size pieces; place in a small bowl. Place scallions on a platter. Grill sausage, turning halfway through, until lightly charred and warmed through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to platter with scallions. Lightly char tortillas and serve warm with kielbasa, scallions, onion, bell peppers, cilantro, hot sauce, and lime wedges for squeezing over.
