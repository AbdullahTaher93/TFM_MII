Cook the noodles according to the package directions. Drain and set aside in a large bowl to cool (a few minutes in the freezer can help!). Cut the noodles up a bit with kitchen shears or a knife to make them easier to toss. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, lime juice, honey, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic. Add the sauce, cilantro, peanuts, and slaw mix to the bowl with the noodles and toss until well combined. If desired, sprinkle in red pepper flakes to taste. Serve at room temperature or refrigerate for later.
