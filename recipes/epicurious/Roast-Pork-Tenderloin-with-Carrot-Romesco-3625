Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast pine nuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes; let cool. Increase temperature to 450°F. Toss carrots with 1 tablespoon oil on another rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and black pepper. Roast, tossing occasionally, until softened and browned, 15–20 minutes; let cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork with salt and black pepper and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 10–15 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven and roast pork until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion registers 145°F, 8–10 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Pulse pine nuts, garlic, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a food processor to a coarse paste. Add Aleppo pepper, one-fourth of carrots, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1 tablespoon water. Process, adding more water as needed, to a coarse purée; season romesco with salt, black pepper, and more vinegar, if desired. Toss greens with remaining carrots and remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar in a large bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Serve pork with romesco and salad.
