Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 300°F. Whisk agave and oil in a large bowl. Stir in oats, coconut flakes, pecans, rice cereal, sesame seeds, salt, and cinnamon until combined. Whisk egg white and 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl. Add to oat mixture and toss to evenly coat. Divide oat mixture between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake granola, rotating sheets top to bottom and back to front and gently stirring halfway through, until golden brown, 25–30 minutes. Transfer sheets to wire racks. Let granola cool before transferring to airtight containers. Granola can be made 1 week ahead; store tightly covered at room temperature.
