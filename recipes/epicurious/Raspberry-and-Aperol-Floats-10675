Bring thyme, sugar, and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit 15 minutes. Remove thyme sprig and let syrup cool. Stir in 1/4 cup Aperol. Divide syrup and raspberries among 4 tall glasses and muddle gently. Dividing evenly, add ice cream and top off each with club soda and more Aperol, if desired.
