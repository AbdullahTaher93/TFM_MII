Put the softened butter in a bowl. In a small saucepan, cook the chorizo over moderate heat until the fat just starts to render, about 2 minutes. Scrape the chorizo and fat into the butter. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice and parsley and use a fork to mix together well. Season with salt, if desired, and serve. The chorizo-lemon butter can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Bring to room temperature before serving.
