Whisk pineapple juice, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, and oil in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add onion and ginger. Set aside 2 Tbsp. marinade for butter. Transfer remaining marinade to a large resealable plastic bag. Add steaks and seal bag, pressing out excess air. Chill at least 1 day. Remove steaks from marinade, pat dry, and let sit until room temperature, about 1 hour. Whisk butter and oil in a medium bowl to combine. Vigorously whisk in reserved marinade; season with salt. Transfer to the center of a sheet of parchment paper and roll up into a log. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour. Build a two-zone fire in a charcoal grill for direct (medium-high coals) and indirect (medium-low coals) heat. Alternatively, heat a gas grill to high just before cooking, leaving one burner on low. Season steaks very lightly with salt (omit this step if marinating more than 24 hours). Grill over high heat, turning, until steaks are well browned and beginning to char around edges, about 4 minutes. Transfer to cooler part of grill and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of steaks registers 120Â°F for medium-rare. (Alternatively, cook in a grill pan over medium-high heat, turning steaks every couple of minutes.) Transfer steaks to a wire rack. Slice butter into 1/4"-thick rounds and divide between steaks. Let rest at least 10 minutes before slicing. Steaks can be marinated 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.
Butter can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.
