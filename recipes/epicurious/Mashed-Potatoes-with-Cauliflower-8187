1. Scrub the potatoes and cut into 2-inch pieces. Arrange them in a steamer basket and steam for 10 minutes. Add the cauliflower to the basket, and cook until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 15 minutes longer. 2. Heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan. Put the cooked vegetables and warm milk in a large pot or bowl, and mash with a potato masher until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
