Bring stock to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Whisk egg yolk and mustard in a bowl. Whisking constantly, gradually add oil, drop by drop at first, until mixture is very thick. Whisk in lemon juice and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Stir in stock. Preheat oven to 200°F. Prepare grill for medium-high heat (or heat a grill pan over medium-high). Rub steak with cut sides of garlic and 1 tablespoon oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning several times, until lightly charred and mediumrare (an instant-read thermometer should register 130°F), 14–16 minutes. Transfer to a rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Meanwhile, toss scallions on another baking sheet with 1 tablespoon oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning often, until tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to rack with beef and keep warm in oven. Arrange greens on a platter; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with lemon juice and 1 tablespoon oil. Toss beets in a bowl with vinegar and remaining 1 tablespoon oil; season with salt and pepper. Arrange over greens. Slice steak 1/2" thick; top greens with scallions and meat. Pour any juices over; season with salt. Serve with aioli.
