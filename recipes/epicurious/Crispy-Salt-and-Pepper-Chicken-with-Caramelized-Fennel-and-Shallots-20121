1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. 2. Place the chicken pieces and flour in a large resealable plastic bag and toss to coat evenly. Shake off any excess flour. Place the chicken, fennel, shallots, and garlic in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt and black and white peppers. Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is crispy, 40 to 45 minutes. Sprinkle with the parsley before serving.
