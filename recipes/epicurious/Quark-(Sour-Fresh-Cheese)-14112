Preheat the oven to 150°F/65°C. Pour the buttermilk into a baking dish and cover tightly with aluminum foil or a lid. Place the baking dish in the oven and bake for 8 to 12 hours. When the buttermilk is ready to drain, the solids will have separated from the whey, either in soft clumps or in one lightly set uniform mass.
