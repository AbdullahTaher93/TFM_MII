Toss 2 cups strawberries and sugar in medium bowl to blend. Let stand at room temperature until juices form, about 1 hour. Add banana and mango to strawberry mixture; place in freezer until partially frozen, about 45 minutes. Combine fruit mixture, plain nonfat yogurt, ice cubes, and vanilla extract in blender. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour smoothie into glasses. Garnish with whole strawberries, if desired, and serve.
