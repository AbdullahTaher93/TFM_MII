Bring water, mint, and sugar to a boil in a 4-to 5-quart saucepan, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Strain through a sieve into a large pitcher, pressing on and then discarding mint. Fill 8 (8-ounces) glasses halfway with ice. Add 2 tablespoons bourbon to each glass, then top off with mint tea.
