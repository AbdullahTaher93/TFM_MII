In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the black-eyed peas and 4 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes. Off the heat, add the salt and set aside while the peas absorb some salt for 10 minutes. Drain. Meanwhile, put the saffron and water in a small bowl. Mix and set aside for at least 15 minutes and as long as overnight. Place a large saut√© pan over medium-low heat and add the olive oil, onion, carrots, and red bell pepper, stirring until the peppers start to soften and the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the saffron (and its blooming water), Persian Spice Mix, garlic, and black-eyed peas. Season the carrots and peas with salt and pepper to taste and stew until the carrots and peppers are tender and the black-eyed peas are glazed. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Stir in the lemon juice, honey, and parsley. Serve cold or at room temperature.
