Divide potatoes between 2 large sheets of foil, then lift edges of foil around potatoes to form a nest so the oil won't leak. Divide garlic, rosemary, and oil between packages, then sprinkle each with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Bring edges of foil together to enclose each package, covering completely, then crimp to seal packages closed. Prepare a grill for medium, indirect heat, preferably with hardwood or hardwood charcoal. Place foil packages near the coals and cook, moving packages around the coals occasionally for even cooking, until potatoes are tender, 30â€“45 minutes. Packages can cooked and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
