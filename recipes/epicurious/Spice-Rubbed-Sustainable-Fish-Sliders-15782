To make the slaw, put the cabbage, fennel, apple, onion, mint and pepitas in a large bowl. Put the vinegar and oil in a jar and shake together. Pour over the slaw and toss lightly. Set aside. To make the spice rub, toast the coriander seeds and cardamom pods in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Using a mortar and pestle, pound and grind together the coriander, cardamom, peppercorns, paprika, salt, garlic powder, oregano, and chile. Season the fish with the spice rub. Heat a little oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Pan-fry the fish for 5 minutes, flip and cook the other side for 5 minutes, or until cooked through. I believe slider-building is a very personal thing, so gather together your rolls, fish, tartar sauce, slaw, and tomato, and put together the slider of your dreams!
