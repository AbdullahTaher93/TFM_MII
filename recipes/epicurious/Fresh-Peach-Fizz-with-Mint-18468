Combine half the sparkling mineral water and honey in a blender. Pour about 1/4 mixture into a martini shaker; add 8 ice cubes and the rest of the sparkling water. Shake. Using the martini strainer, pour into a martini glass until almost full. Drizzle peach juice over top to fill. Garnish with mint, pushed into the drink, and serve.
