Whisk anchovies and oil in a small bowl. Using the coarse grater disk on a food processor or the largest holes on a box grater, coarsely grate tomatoes (you should have about 1 1/2 cups tomato pulp). Rub halved garlic cloves on one side of hot toasts, then drizzle evenly with anchovy oil. Top with tomato pulp and sprinkle with sea salt. Serve warm.
