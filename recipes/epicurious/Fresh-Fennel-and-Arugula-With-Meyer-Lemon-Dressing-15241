To prepare the dressing: Place the olive oil and lemon juice in a small glass jar with a lid and season with salt and pepper. Secure the lid and shake until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate until ready to use. To prepare the salad: Remove the green, feathery stalks from the fennel bulb, thinly slice the white part of the fennel bulb on a Japanese mandolin or with a knife. The thinner you cut the fennel the better. Place the sliced fennel in a medium mixing bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of the prepared dressing. Let sit for 30 minutes (this will soften the fennel slices a bit). Add the orange segments to the bowl and toss gently. Place the arugula in a medium mixing bowl and toss with remaining dressing. Divide the arugula among 4 plates and top with some of the fennel mixture. Season with a twist of freshly ground black pepper.
