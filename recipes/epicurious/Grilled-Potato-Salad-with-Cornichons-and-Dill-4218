In a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderate heat until just tender when poked with a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly. Light a grill and preheat for at least 10 minutes or preheat a grill pan. Slice the potatoes crosswise 1/2 inch thick and transfer to a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss. Grill the potatoes over moderately high heat until dark brown grill marks form, about 5 minutes. Flip and grill until the potatoes are browned and completely tender, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Return the potatoes to the bowl. In another large bowl, mix the cornichons with the pickled onions, the vinegar, dill and the remaining 1/4 cup of oil. Add the potatoes, season with salt and pepper and toss well. Let stand for at least 10 minutes, then serve warm or at room temperature.
