Whisk cornstarch and 1 cup milk in a medium bowl; set slurry aside. Heat cream, honey, sugar, salt, and remaining 2 cups milk in a medium saucepan over medium, whisking occasionally, until mixture just begins to boil, 8â€“10 minutes. Whisking constantly, gradually add reserved slurry and cook, still whisking, until pudding thickens and comes to a boil, about 1 minute. Scrape into a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against surface. Chill until cold, at least 4 hours. Pudding can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Bring sugar, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Cook, swirling pan occasionally (do not stir), until caramel turns golden amber. Remove from heat, add cinnamon stick, and stir in 1/4 cup water (be careful as caramel will bubble vigorously); stir to combine and loosen. Stir in rose water, then gently toss figs in caramel. Remove cinnamon stick. Whisk chilled pudding until smooth and creamy. Divide among bowls; serve topped with warm caramel and figs.
