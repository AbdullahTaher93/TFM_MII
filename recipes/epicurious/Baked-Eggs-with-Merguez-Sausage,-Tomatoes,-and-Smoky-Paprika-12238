Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove to a bowl and cook the sausage until brown, about 7 minutes. Spoon or pour off excess fat and return onions and garlic to the pan. Add the tomatoes, paprika, and salt. Cook until mixture has warmed through, about 2 minutes. Brush ramekins with olive oil. Divide the sausage mixture among the ramekins. With the back of a spoon, gently press into mixture to create a well. Top each with an egg. Bake until egg whites are cooked and the yolks are still runny, 12 to 15 minutes. Top with a sprinkling of cilantro. Serve immediately with toasted bread.
