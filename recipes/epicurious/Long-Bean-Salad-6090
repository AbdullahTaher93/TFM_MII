Preheat oven to 350Â° Toast coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, cook watercress in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until just wilted, about 10 seconds; using a slotted spoon, transfer to a colander set in a large bowl of ice water. Drain, then gently squeeze out excess water. Return water in saucepan to a boil. Cook beans until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes; transfer to ice water. Drain, then pat dry. Whisk fish sauce, lime juice, and coconut sugar in a large bowl until sugar dissolves. Add watercress, beans, onion, and kaffir lime leaves and toss to coat. Serve topped with coconut and peanuts.
