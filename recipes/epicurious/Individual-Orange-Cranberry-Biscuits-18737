1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. 2. Combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. 3. Place the yogurt, orange juice, brown sugar, orange zest, and vanilla into the Vitamix container in the order listed and secure the lid. Select Variable 1. Turn the machine on and slowly increase the speed to Variable 10, then to High. Blend for 20 seconds. 4. Pour the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture and fold in the cranberries. 5. On a floured surface, pat the dough into a 9-inch (23-cm) round about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. Cut into 12 wedges. 6. Place the wedges on the baking sheet and brush the tops with the milk. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until lightly browned. 7. Remove from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack.
