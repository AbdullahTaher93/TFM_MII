Preheat oven to 350ºF. Toss 1 cup blanched almonds, 1 cup pecans, 1 cup walnuts, 1/4 cup raw pumpkin seeds, 1/3 cup pure maple syrup, 2 Tbsp. olive oil, 2 Tbsp. rosemary leaves, 2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, 1 tsp. hot smoked Spanish paprika, and 1 tsp. kosher salt in a medium bowl. Roast on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until nuts are toasted, 20–25 minutes. Spread out on parchment paper, breaking up clusters. Let cool. Nuts can be candied 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
