Preheat oven to 400°F. Rub pork with oil; season generously with salt and pepper and rub with fennel seeds, anise seeds, and red pepper flakes, pressing to adhere. Place pork roast, fat side up, on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135°F, 60–70 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let pork rest at least 10 minutes before slicing. DO AHEAD: Pork can be seasoned 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
