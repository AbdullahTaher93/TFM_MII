Combine garlic, shrimp, orange juice, oil, chili paste, paprika, and pepper in a medium bowl. Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. Line a serving platter with orange slices; set aside. Cover bottom of grill pan or cast-iron skillet evenly with salt. Place pan over medium-high heat, cover (salt may pop while it's heating), and heat until pan and salt are hot. Place shrimp in pan in a single layer and cook, uncovered, until shrimp are opaque throughout, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to prepared platter, brushing off any excess salt.
