Toss cabbage, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl, cover, and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes to allow cabbage to soften (or cover and chill up to 2 hours). Add onion, lemon juice, oil, and vinegar to cabbage and toss to coat. Let sit, uncovered, at room temperature 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, cilantro, mint, and pomegranate seeds and toss to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed.
