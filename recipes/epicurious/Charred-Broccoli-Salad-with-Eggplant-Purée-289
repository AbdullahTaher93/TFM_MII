Preheat oven to 350°F. Brush eggplant on all sides with oil, season with salt and pepper, and roast, cut side down, on a rimmed baking sheet until lightly browned and softened, 30–40 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, heat a dry medium cast-iron skillet over high. Cook broccoli florets, tossing occasionally, until surfaces are blackened, 10–15 minutes. Transfer to a large plate; let cool. Toss chiles, sugar, and 1 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Let sit until juices release, 12–15 minutes. Add white wine vinegar. Meanwhile, toast coriander seeds in a dry small skillet, tossing often, until fragrant, about 4 minutes; let cool. Finely grind in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl and whisk in rice vinegar, 1/4 cup oil, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 2 Tbsp. water; season vinaigrette with salt and pepper. Scoop eggplant flesh into a food processor; discard skin. Add malt vinegar, agave, tahini, and remaining 2 Tbsp. lemon juice. With motor running, stream in remaining 1/4 cup oil; process until smooth. Season eggplant purée with salt and pepper. Toss charred broccoli, broccoli stems, and vinaigrette in a large bowl. Serve over eggplant purée topped with cashews, cilantro, and drained chiles.
