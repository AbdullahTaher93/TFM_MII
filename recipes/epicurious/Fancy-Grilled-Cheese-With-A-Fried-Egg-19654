Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Heat a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Butter one side of each slice of bread and place 4 slices in skillet, buttered side down. Top bread with cheese, reduce heat to low, and cook until underside is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. Top with remaining bread, buttered side up, turn sandwiches and cook until second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer sandwiches to a rimmed baking sheet and place in oven to keep warm. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Crack eggs into skillet; season with salt and pepper. Cook until whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes. Drizzle sandwiches with honey and top each with a fried egg.
