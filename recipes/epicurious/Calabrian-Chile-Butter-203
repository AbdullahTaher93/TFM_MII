Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-low. Cook chiles, garlic, and shallots, stirring occasionally, until soft but without taking on color, 10â€“12 minutes; let cool completely. Transfer chile mixture to a blender, add butter, and blend to combine. Add scallions, cilantro, parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, oregano, mustard, paprika, and 2 Tbsp. salt. Pulse to combine. Taste and add more salt if needed. Chile butter can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
