Heat the olive oil with the almonds in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring every couple of minutes or so, until the almonds are evenly light brown in color and the oil is highly fragrant. Cool the oil to room temperature. Store it tightly covered in the refrigerator; the oil will congeal, so take it out about 20 minutes before you need it. It will keep for a couple of weeks in the fridge and can also be frozen for months, until the next sale!
