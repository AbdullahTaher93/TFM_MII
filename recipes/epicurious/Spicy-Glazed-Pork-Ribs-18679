Whisk gochujang, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, and oil in a small bowl until smooth; season with salt. Toss ribs and half of marinade in a 13x9" baking dish; set aside remaining marinade. Cover ribs with foil and chill at least 4 hours. Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake ribs, covered, until meat is tender, about 1 hour. Uncover and increase oven temperature to 450°F. Roast, turning occasionally and brushing with reserved marinade during last 5 minutes, until ribs are deeply browned, glazed, and fork-tender, 40–45 minutes longer. DO AHEAD: Ribs can be marinated 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
