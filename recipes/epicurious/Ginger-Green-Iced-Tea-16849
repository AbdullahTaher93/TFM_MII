1. Place 2 cups water and the ginger into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the honey. Remove the pan from heat and add the tea bags. Steep for 3 minutes, and then strain out all the solids. 2. In a large pitcher combine the strained tea with the remaining 3 cups water. Chill in the refrigerator. Serve over ice, garnished with mint sprigs, if using.
