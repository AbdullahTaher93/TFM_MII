Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss oats, hazelnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, coconut, honey, oil, and salt in a large bowl. Spread out on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake, tossing occasionally, until crisp and golden brown, 20–25 minutes. Let cool. Serve with dried fruit and yogurt. DO AHEAD: Granola can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
