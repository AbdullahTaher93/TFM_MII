In a stainless steel or enameled saucepan combine the cranberry juice, the cider, and the cinnamon stick, bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the mixture for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the rum, the honey, and the butter, and stir the mixture until the butter is melted. Ladle the cider into heated mugs.
