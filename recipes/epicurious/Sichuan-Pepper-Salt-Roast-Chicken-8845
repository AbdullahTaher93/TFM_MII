Preheat oven to 425°F with rack in middle. Finely grind peppercorns with salt in grinder. Pat chicken dry, then rub with olive oil and 2 teaspoons pepper-salt (reserve remainder). Transfer to a rack set over a roasting pan. Pour 1 cup water into bottom of pan and roast chicken until skin is golden and crisp and a thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh (do not touch bone) registers 170°F, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer chicken to a platter and let rest 10 minutes. Serve chicken with remaining pepper-salt on the side.
