Pulse jalapeño, turmeric, ginger, garlic, cilantro, oil, lime zest, and lime juice in a food processor until smooth with a few flecks of cilantro. Transfer to a small bowl; season with salt. Prepare a grill for high heat. Grill corn, turning occasionally, until charred and cooked through, 6–8 minutes. Let cool; cut kernels off cobs and place in a large bowl. (Or, cut kernels from cobs and char in a dry cast-iron skillet over medium-high, 8–10 minutes.) Heat broiler. Broil peppers on a rimmed baking sheet, turning occasionally, until blackened in spots and nearly cooked through, 12–18 minutes. Let cool; cut into 1" strips, retaining as much charred skin as possible; add to corn. Broil tomatoes on same baking sheet, tossing once, until blackened in spots and starting to burst, about 5 minutes. Let cool. Add tomatoes, endive, and greens to corn; toss to combine. Drizzle dressing over and toss to coat; season with salt.
