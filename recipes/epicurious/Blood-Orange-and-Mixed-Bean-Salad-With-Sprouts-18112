Combine chile, oil, lime juice, and vinegar in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add beans and toss to coat. Let sit 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Meanwhile, using a small knife, remove peel and white pith from oranges. Cut crosswise into 1/4"-thick rounds. Add oranges, celery, and half of sprouts and cilantro to beans. Season with salt and pepper and toss once to combine. Serve topped with remaining sprouts and cilantro.
