Toss scallions, chile, lime juice, oil, ginger, and brown sugar in a medium bowl to combine; season with salt. Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Oil grates. Combine honey, sambal oelek, vinegar, and Sriracha in a small bowl; set glaze aside. Thread bacon onto 6–8 skewers, folding back and forth in accordion style, and grill over indirect heat, turning every minute or so, until browned and crisp, 10–12 minutes. Baste with reserved glaze, turning every 30 seconds or so, until lacquered and slightly sticky, about 3 minutes (move to an even cooler spot if needed to keep glaze from scorching). Serve bacon with relish and lime wedges. Glaze can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
