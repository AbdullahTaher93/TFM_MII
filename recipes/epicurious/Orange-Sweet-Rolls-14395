Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, sugar, orange zest, salt, and cardamom, if using, in a large bowl until fluffy. Pour 3 Tbsp. warm water (105°F–115°F) into a small bowl. Add yeast and 1 Tbsp. sugar and whisk to combine. Let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Using electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg yolk, orange juice, oil, salt, and remaining 1 Tbsp. sugar in a large bowl. Add 1 2/3 cups flour and yeast mixture. Beat until dough just comes together. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead several times with floured hands until smooth, about 5 minutes (dough will be sticky). Spray a clean large bowl with nonstick spray. Place dough in bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a towel and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Spray muffin tin with nonstick spray. Roll dough on a well floured surface to an 1/8"-thick rectangle about 17x14". Spread filling over dough, leaving a 1/2" border on all sides. Starting on 1 long side, roll dough into a tight cylinder. Cut into 12 equal pieces (if it's difficult to cut, chill 15 minutes). Transfer cut side up to prepared muffin tin. Cover with a towel and let sit in a warm, draft-free place until risen, 30 minutes, or chill overnight. If chilling, let sit at room temperature 2 hours to rise before baking. Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake rolls, rotating pans halfway through, until lightly browned on top, 15–18 minutes. Let cool in pan 5 minutes, then invert onto a platter to serve.
