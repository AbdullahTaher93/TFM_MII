Place the beef in a large saucepan with the beer, oranges, garlic, bay leaf, thyme sprigs, honey, vinegar, spices and peppercorns and cover with water. Put a lid on the pan and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 2 1/2–3 hours, topping up the water during cooking if necessary, until a fork can be easily inserted into the centre of the meat. Carefully remove the beef and put it on a cutting board to rest for about for 10 minutes. Add the 500ml (2 cups) of water to the pan and bring to the boil over a medium heat. Put in the vegetables and bring back up to the boil. Reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook for 15–20 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Discard the orange pieces. Use 2 forks to pull the meat apart. Divide it between bowls and serve with the broth and vegetables.
