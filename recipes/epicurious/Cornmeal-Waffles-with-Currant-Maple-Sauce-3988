Whisk flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. Whisk egg, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla in a small bowl, then whisk into dry ingredients. Let sit 20 minutes (this helps hydrate and soften the cornmeal). Heat a Belgian waffle iron (or use a regular waffle iron and use less batter per batch; you may get more waffles depending on size of your iron) until very hot. Lightly coat with nonstick spray. Working in 2 batches, pour 1/2-cupful batter onto iron and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, bring currants and 1/4 cup maple syrup to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until syrup reduces a little, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. Serve waffles with currant-maple sauce and additional maple syrup, if desired. Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat gently before serving.
