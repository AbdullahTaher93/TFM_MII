Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat a heavy ovenproof pot or Dutch oven on a stovetop over high heat. Score the chicken skin at regular intervals, drizzle with the oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Add to the pot and cook for 6–8 minutes on each side or until well browned. Remove from the pot and set aside. Add the tarragon, lemon zest, garlic and fennel to the pot and cook for 2–3 minutes or until golden. Return the chicken to the pot with the wine and stock and bring to a simmer. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20–25 minutes or until the chicken is just cooked through. Serve with the lemon wedges.
