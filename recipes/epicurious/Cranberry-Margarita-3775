Bring cranberries, sugar, orange juice, and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and jammy, 30â€“40 minutes. Mix in orange zest; let cool. DO AHEAD: Jam can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill. Mix salt, sugar, and five-spice powder on a small plate. Rub rims of Old Fashioned glasses with lime wedge; dip in salt mixture and fill glasses with ice. For each cocktail, combine 1/2 ounce lime juice, 1 ounce orange juice, 1 1/2 ounces tequila, and 2 tablespoons cranberry jam in a cocktail shaker; fill with ice. Cover and shake until outside is frosty, about 30 seconds. Strain into prepared glass.
