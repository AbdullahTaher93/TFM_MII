Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium. Add shallots and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if needed, until shallots are golden brown and tender, 15â€“18 minutes. Let cool slightly. Mix shallots and vinegar into yogurt in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stir 1 Tbsp. chives into yogurt; divide among bowls and top with more chives. Serve with chips for dipping. Yogurt (without chives) can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill.
