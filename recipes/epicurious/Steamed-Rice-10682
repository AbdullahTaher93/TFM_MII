Wash the rice. Put rice and salt into a heavy skillet lightly greased with butter. Pour on enough water or stock to come 1 1/2" above the rice. Cover tightly and bring to a rapid boil very quickly. Lower the heat and let the rice cook very slowly until all the liquid is absorbed. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes. Do not remove cover during cooking time. Fluff up rice with a fork and serve.
