Preheat the oven to 350°F. Peel and core the apples, but do not discard the peels. Slice the peeled apples into 1/4 inch slices and place into a large mixing bowl. Combine 1 cup of the sliced apples, the apple skins, the honey, 1 tablespoon flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in the bowl of a food processor. Process on high speed until the skins are finely chopped, about 3 minutes. (This will seem like a long time.) Stop and scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. Stir the chopped mixture into the bowl of sliced apples, then spoon into a greased 8‑inch square baking pan. Set aside. To make the topping, combine all the topping ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Stir until blended, then spoon over the apples. Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake 50-60 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the apple slices are tender. Cool 10-15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
