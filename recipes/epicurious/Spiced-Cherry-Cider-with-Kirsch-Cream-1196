Bring cherry cider, cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and 1 tablespoon sugar to boil in heavy large saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer until spiced cider is reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 10 minutes. Strain cider. Whisk whipping cream, kirsch, and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl to very soft peaks. Ladle cider into glass mugs and top with kirsch cream. Garnish each serving with some grated chocolate, if desired.
