Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and red bell pepper and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the black beans and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, another 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and then transfer the mixture to a bowl. Whisk the eggs and egg whites together in a medium-size bowl, then add the cheese. Spray the skillet with cooking spray and reheat it over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low, add the eggs, and scramble until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Spread each tortilla with 1 tablespoon each of sour cream and salsa, then layer with 1/4 of the black bean mixture, 1/4 of the scrambled eggs, some diced tomato, and 1/4 of the avocado. Season to taste with the hot pepper sauce. Roll up burrito-style.
