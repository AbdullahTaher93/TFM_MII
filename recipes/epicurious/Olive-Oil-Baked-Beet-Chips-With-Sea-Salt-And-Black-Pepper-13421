Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line several baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a mandoline, thinly slice beets to a thickness of 1/16". In a large bowl, toss beet slices with oil to coat evenly. On prepared baking sheets, in a single layer, arrange as many slices as will fit without crowding. Bake until crisp, 25-30 minutes, rotating pans once halfway through baking. Cool chips and blot with paper towels to remove any excess oil. Repeat, using a cool prepared baking sheet for each batch, until all beet slices are baked. Toss chips with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste.
