Heat oil in a small skillet over medium. Fry rosemary until crisp, about 20 seconds. Transfer to a paper towel to drain; set rosemary oil aside. Mix yogurt and honey in a small bowl; season with kosher salt. Toss watermelon and grapefruit juice in a large bowl; season with flaky sea salt. Spread yogurt on a large platter. Top with watermelon and crumble fried rosemary over. Drizzle 1 Tbsp. reserved rosemary oil over (save remaining oil for another use) and sprinkle with red pepper flakes and poppy seeds.
