Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a food processor, pulse the first 6 ingredients until finely chopped (it's ok if there are few coarsely chopped pieces). Add the honey and sunflower and pulse until starting to combine. Pour the mixture into a 9 x 9 inch pan, greased then line with parchment and press down into the pan until completely even. Bake for 25 minutes. Let the bars completely cool before cutting with a serrated knife into bars. Serve.
