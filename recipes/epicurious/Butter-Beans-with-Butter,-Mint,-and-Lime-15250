In a medium saucepan, bring 6 cups water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil over high heat. Add butter beans and cook until tender, 9-12 minutes, depending on the size of the beans. Drain in a colander; shake colander several times to shed as much water as possible. Put butter in a large serving bowl, and pour warm butter beans on top. Toss beans with butter until all the butter is melted. Add lime juice and toss again to distribute. Fold in mint, season with salt and pepper, and scatter lime zest over the top. Serve immediately.
