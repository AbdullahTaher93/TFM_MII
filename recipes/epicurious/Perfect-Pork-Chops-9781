MAKE IT: Season both sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper to taste and drizzle with the olive oil. Set the chops, covered, on the counter for 1 hour before preparing the dish to bring them to room temperature. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the shallots in butter until translucent. Add the wine, mustard, and molasses, syrup, or honey to the shallots and stir. Cook for 3 minutes, then add the pork chops and cover. Simmer for 25 minutes and remove from heat. To serve, let the pork chops rest for 5 minutes and then slice thinly and spoon the sauce over the top.
