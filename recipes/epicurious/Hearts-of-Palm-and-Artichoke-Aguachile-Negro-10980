Combine onion and 1/4 cup vinegar in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto surface. Chill until onion is uniformly pink, at least 4 hours. Heat a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook tortilla and chile, turning often, until completely charred, 8-10 minutes. Let cool. Blend tortilla, chile, celery, oil, lemon juice, and remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar until very smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve lined with a layer of cheesecloth into a small bowl; discard solids. Add reserved palm liquid to make 1 cup; season aguachile with salt. Combine palm and artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and radishes in a large bowl and toss with 1/2 cup aguachile; season with salt. Let sit at least 30 minutes. Just before serving, drain pickled onion and add to marinated vegetables along with cilantro. Toss to combine and transfer to a platter. Pour remaining marinade over top or serve alongside. Do ahead: Onion can be prepared 1 day ahead; keep chilled. Aguachile can be made 1 day ahead.
