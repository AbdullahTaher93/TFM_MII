In a small saucepan, combine all the ingredients and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir until sugar is dissolved, then remove from heat. Let syrup cool to room temperature, then strain. Fill each glass with 1 teaspoon cardamom syrup, and add a dash of bitters. Top up with prosecco and serve garnished with an orange twist.
