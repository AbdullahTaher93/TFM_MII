Set a coffee filter in a sieve set over a heatproof measuring cup or bowl. Pur√©e chives and oil in a blender until well blended. Transfer to a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture is sizzling, about 3 minutes. Remove chive oil from heat and strain though prepared sieve (do not press on solids or oil will be cloudy); let cool. DO AHEAD: Chive oil can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
