Put the chicken cubes in a bowl with the coconut milk and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the mango salsa. Mix the avocado, mango, cilantro, onion and chili together in a bowl and pour over the coconut aminos. Refrigerate until needed. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Put the flour and spices in a bowl and put the desiccated coconut on a plate. Take a chicken cube, roll it in the spiced flour, then roll it in the desiccated coconut until it is well coated, then put it on a baking tray. Repeat with the remaining chicken cubes. Pour the melted coconut oil over the chicken and bake in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through, golden brown and crispy. To serve, put a spoonful of the mango salsa into each lettuce leaf, add a few chicken nuggets, fold in the sides of the lettuce to enclose it and eat like a sandwich.
