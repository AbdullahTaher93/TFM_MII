Combine tomato, red onion, garlic, lime juice, cilantro, cayenne, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside. Prepare grill for high heat. Wrap each hot dog in 1 bacon slice and grill, turning often, until bacon is cooked through and crisp on all sides, 12–14 minutes. Meanwhile, slice open buns, leaving ends intact. Gently toast in a 350°F oven or on grill until buns are warmed through and lightly crispy. Nestle hot dogs into buns. Spoon 1 Tbsp. beans on one side of each dog, then arrange avocado slices and 1 Tbsp. jalapeños on the other side. Spoon pico de gallo over hot dogs, then drizzle with mayonnaise and top evenly with chips and cilantro.
