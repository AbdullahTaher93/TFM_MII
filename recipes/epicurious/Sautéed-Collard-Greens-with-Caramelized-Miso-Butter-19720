Heat miso in a large skillet over medium, stirring constantly, until it starts to caramelize and brown (it will be very dark), about 3 minutes. Add mirin and vinegar, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to low and, stirring constantly, add butter one piece at a time; stir until emulsified. Transfer miso butter to a small bowl and set aside. Wipe out skillet. Heat oil over medium and cook garlic, smashing with a spoon, until golden brown and broken into bits, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer garlic to a small bowl; season with salt. Working in batches, add collard greens to same skillet, tossing and letting them wilt slightly before adding more; season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until all greens are wilted, bright green, and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add half of reserved miso butter and toss to coat. Transfer collard greens to a large serving bowl and drizzle with remaining miso butter. Top with reserved garlic and squeeze lemon over.
