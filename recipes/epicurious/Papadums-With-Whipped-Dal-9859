Line a plate with paper towels. Pour a shallow layer of canola oil in a large sauté pan or skillet and heat over high heat until it ripples. Fry the papadum sheets one at a time until crispy, about 30 seconds. There’s no need to flip them, as they are so thin. Transfer to the paper towel–lined plate to absorb excess oil, then cool to room temperature. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Heat the sunflower oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until it ripples. Add the onion, garlic, curry, cardamom, ginger, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, add 3 cups water and the lentils, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool fully. Transfer the lentil mixture to a blender with the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth. Serve with papadum pieces or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
