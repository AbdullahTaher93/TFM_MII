Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss apples, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons butter in a 2-quart baking dish. Toss oats, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, salt, remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, and remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a small bowl until evenly mixed and no dry spots remain (it should be very wet and form into clumps when pressed together). Sprinkle oat mixture over apples and bake until topping is golden brown (it will crisp as it cools) and filling is juicy and bubbling, 50–60 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes to let juices set. Serve topped with scoops of ice cream. Crisp can be baked 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Reheat before serving.
