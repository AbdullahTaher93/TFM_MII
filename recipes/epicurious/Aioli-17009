Peel the garlic cloves. Cut each garlic clove in half, and remove the central pale green sprout from the garlic, if there is one. Put the eggs and garlic into a deep bowl tall pitcher. Process with a hand-held blender until smooth. With the blender running, add the oil little by little. Season with salt. The aioli should have a thick, creamy texture like mayonnaise.
