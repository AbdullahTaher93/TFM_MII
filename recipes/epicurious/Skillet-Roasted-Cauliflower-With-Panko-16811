Toast pine nuts in a large skillet over medium-high heat, tossing often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in same skillet and cook panko, tossing often, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add to bowl with pine nuts; wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in same skillet and cook cauliflower, tossing occasionally, until browned but not cooked through, 10–12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add 3/4 cup water. Cook until cauliflower is crisp-tender and water has evaporated, 10–12 minutes. Add garlic, butter, and pickled peppers to cauliflower and cook, tossing, until butter is melted and garlic and pickled peppers are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in pine nuts and panko, Parmesan, and mint; season with salt and pepper.
