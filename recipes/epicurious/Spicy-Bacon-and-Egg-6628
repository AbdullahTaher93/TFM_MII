In a medium pan over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Cook two eggs until edges start to brown, 45 seconds. Break yolks; cook 15 seconds; flip. Season each egg with 2 teaspoons Tabasco and black pepper. Top each egg with 1 slice cheese; cook until cheese melts and egg edges are crispy, 40 seconds. Remove eggs from pan; set aside. Repeat with remaining oil and eggs. Cook bacon in batches, flipping once, until crispy, 2 minutes per side. Place bacon on a paper towel-lined plate. In a bowl, whisk together mayo and adobo; spread on toast slices. Divide bacon, cheesy eggs, tomato and cabbage among 4 toast slices; top with remaining slices.
