Preheat oven to 400°F. Place tomatoes, cut side up, on a large rimmed baking sheet. Season with 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper, then drizzle with 3 Tbsp. oil. Roast tomatoes until tender and caramelized, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a medium pot over medium. Cook onion and 1/2 tsp. salt, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, 8–10 minutes. Add roasted tomatoes and any accumulated juices, cream, and 1 1/4 cups water to pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until flavors have melded, 20–25 minutes. Working in batches, transfer tomato mixture to a blender and purée until smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed. Divide among bowls, then top with a drizzle of oil and freshly ground pepper.
