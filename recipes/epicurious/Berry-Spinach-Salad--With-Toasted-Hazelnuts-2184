Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 350Â°F. Spread out the hazelnuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast in the oven until the skins split and the nuts turn a deep golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. While still hot, rub the hazelnuts in a clean kitchen towel to remove the skins (some bits of skin will remain). Cool for 5 minutes, then chop. Combine the oil, lemon zest and lemon juice, kefir, honey, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Divide the salad greens among four plates. Top with the carrots, radishes, and berries and drizzle with the dressing. Garnish with the chopped hazelnuts and serve immediately.
