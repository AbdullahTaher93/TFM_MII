Preheat oven to 400°. Lay out pastry squares on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake until golden, about 14 minutes. Remove; let settle and cool. Melt butter in a large skillet and sauté mushrooms until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and herbs. Divide mixture among pastry squares, dot with goat cheese, and sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake for 8-10 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Cut tarts into 3" squares. Serve warm or at room temperature.
