In a heavy saucepan, combine the cocoa powder, the sugar, the water, the vanilla, and a pinch of salt and heat the mixture over low heat, whisking, until the cocoa powder is dissolved and the mixture is a smooth paste. Gradually add the half-and-half and the milk, both scalded, and simmer the hot chocolate, whisking, for 2 minutes. Stir in the crème de menthe and the crème de cacao. (For a frothy result, in a blender blend the hot chocolate in batches.) Divide the chocolate among mugs and top it with the whipped cream and the chocolate.
