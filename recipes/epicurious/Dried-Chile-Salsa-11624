Toast chiles in a dry medium skillet over high heat, turning often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let cool slightly, then remove stems and seeds. Place chiles, onion, garlic, salt, and 1 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until very soft, 15–20 minutes. Purée chile mixture in a blender until smooth. Strain into a medium bowl and mix in vinegar. DO AHEAD: Salsa can be made 4 days ahead. Cover and chill.
