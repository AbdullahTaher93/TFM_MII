Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Unfold the puff pastry sheet and cut sheet in 6 equal pieces. Gently stretch each piece into a 5x5 inch square. Place each piece of pastry in a greased muffin cup leaving a 1/2 overhang at the top. Sprinkle one teaspoon of the parmesan in the pastry lined cups, crack an egg into each cup, top with bacon, 1 teaspoon parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt. Whisk together the remaining egg and water and lightly brush pastry edges with egg wash. Bake for 20 minutes, remove from oven and immediately move to a wire rack. Let cool 5 minutes and then serve.
