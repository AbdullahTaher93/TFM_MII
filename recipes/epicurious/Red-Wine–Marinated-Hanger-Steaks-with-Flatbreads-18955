Combine lemon, thyme, chiles, garlic, wine, oil, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add steak, close bag, and turn to coat. Chill at least 4 hours. Steak can be marinated 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Prepare campfire for medium-high heat. Bank coals on one side to create a two-zone fire; oil grate. (If cooking at home with a gas grill, leave one or two burners off.) Cook shallot, garlic, chile, and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until shallots are softened; season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Remove steak from marinade; season with salt. Grill over direct heat, turning occasionally, until cooked to desired doneness, 8â€“10 minutes for mediumrare. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes. Slice against the grain. Meanwhile, working one at a time, gently stretch each piece of dough into an oval (about 12x8") and grill over direct heat, flipping and rotating as needed, until lightly charred and stiff, about 1 minute per side. Move to cooler part of grill to keep warm until ready to serve. Spoon shallot butter over flatbreads and top with parsley. Serve with steak.
