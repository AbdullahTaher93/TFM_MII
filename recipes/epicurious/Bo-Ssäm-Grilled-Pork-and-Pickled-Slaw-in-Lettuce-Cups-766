Combine vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl. Add radishes and carrots and let stand at least 10 minutes. (Reserve half of the pickled veggies for Pork Banh Mi with Quick-Pickled Radishes and Carrots later in the week.) Preheat oven to 250°F. Place pork in a roasting pan with a few tablespoons of water. Cover with foil and rewarm pork until hot, 20–25 minutes. Transfer pork to a platter. Serve with lettuce, scallions, rice, Sriracha, oysters (if using), and remaining pickled radishes and carrots alongside. The quick-pickled radishes and carrots can be made up to 3 days in advance.
