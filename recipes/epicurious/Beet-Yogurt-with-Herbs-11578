Preheat oven to 450Â°. Place beets in a small baking dish and add hot water to come 1/2" up sides of dish; season with salt. Cover beets with a piece of parchment paper, then cover dish tightly with foil. Cook beets until tender, about 1 hour. Remove beets from baking dish, let cool slightly, then rub off skins with a paper towel. Coarsely grate beets. Mix beets, yogurt, chopped mint, tarragon, oil, and 2 teaspoons vinegar in a medium bowl; season with salt and more vinegar, if desired. Cover and chill at least 3 hours to let flavors meld. Top beet yogurt with mint leaves. DO AHEAD: Beet yogurt can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
