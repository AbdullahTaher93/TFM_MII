Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange the carrots in a single layer on the foil. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, salt and pepper to taste, and toss the carrots to fully coat with oil and seasoning. Bake until tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dressing: In a large bowl, add the orange juice, Champagne vinegar, honey, and a pinch of salt and whisk to combine. Add the remaining 1 cup of oil in a slow stream, whisking continuously. When the carrots are finished, throw them in a serving bowl, top with a little dressing, and stir to combine. Eat them hot or cold.
