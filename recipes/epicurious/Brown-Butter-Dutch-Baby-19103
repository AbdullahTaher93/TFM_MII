Preheat oven to 425°F. Melt butter in a medium cast-iron or ovenproof skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until butter foams, then browns (do not burn), about 5 minutes. Swirl butter in skillet to coat sides of pan, then transfer half to a small bowl; set aside. Blend eggs, flour, milk, salt, and 1/4 cup sugar in a blender until pale and foamy, about 1 minute. Pour batter into hot skillet, then transfer to oven and bake until puffed and lightly browned, 15–20 minutes. Drizzle with reserved brown butter and sprinkle with remaining 1 Tbsp. sugar. Cut into wedges and serve.
