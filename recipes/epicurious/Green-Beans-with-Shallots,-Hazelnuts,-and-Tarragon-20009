Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven, tossing halfway through, until skins are splitting and nuts are fragrant, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to steam and cool, then rub the nuts with a kitchen towel to remove their skins. Roughly chop the hazelnuts and set aside. In a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add shallots and cook, tossing, until lightly golden and softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and set aside. Reduce heat to medium, and add 1/2 cup water, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, salt, and pepper to the same pan. Add the haricots verts and toss to coat. Cover pan and cook, tossing occasionally, until bright green and crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Remove cover, raise heat to high and cook until the water evaporates and the beans are glazed, about 3 minutes more. Toss green beans with tarragon, lemon zest, hazelnuts, and sautéed shallots. Serve immediately.
