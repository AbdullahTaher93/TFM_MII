Preheat oven to 375ÂºF. Lightly grease muffin pan with oil. Place 1 slice of prosciutto in each muffin cup, being sure to fully cover bottom and sides and leaving about a 1/4" overhang on all sides. Spoon 1 heaping Tbsp. cheese into each prosciutto cup. Crack 1 egg into each, being careful not to break yolk. Drizzle 1 tsp. cream over each egg, then top with a pinch of thyme, salt, and pepper. Bake until whites have just set, about 15 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool 3 minutes. Run a knife around edges of prosciutto baskets and scoop out of pan. Serve immediately.
