Bring 2 thyme sprigs, 2 cups broth, and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add a pinch of salt, then rice; reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 40–45 minutes. Remove thyme and let cool. Drain, if needed. Meanwhile, cook farro in another medium saucepan, using remaining 2 thyme sprigs, 2 cups broth, and 1 1/2 cups water and cooking 35–40 minutes. Using a sharp knife, cut all peel and white pith from tangerines; discard. Working over a large bowl, cut between membranes to release segments, placing segments in a small bowl. Squeeze juice from membranes into large bowl (you should have about 1/2 cup juice); discard membranes. Whisk oil into tangerine juice in large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add tangerine segments, wild rice, farro, and scallions and toss gently to coat; season with more tangerine juice, if desired.
