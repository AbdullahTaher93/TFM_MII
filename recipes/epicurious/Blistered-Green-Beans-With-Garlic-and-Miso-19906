Mix garlic, lime juice, miso, and coconut nectar in a small bowl to combine. Set garlic mixture aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add green beans and cook, undisturbed, until beginning to blister, about 2 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing often, until tender and blistered in spots, 8â€“12 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, pour in garlic mixture, and toss green beans to coat. Add red pepper flakes; season with sea salt and black pepper. Transfer to a platter and top with cilantro.
