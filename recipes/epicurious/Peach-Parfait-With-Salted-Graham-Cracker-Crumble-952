Preheat oven to 325°F. Pulse graham cracker crumbs, flour, salt, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer to a medium bowl and add melted butter; mix until a few large clumps form. Spread out crumble on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, shaking once, until golden, 12–15 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, toss peaches, brown sugar, and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in a medium bowl. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over medium; cook peaches, tossing often, until sugar is dissolved and peaches are soft, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. Mash raspberries with a spoon in a small bowl, then mix in remaining 1 tsp. granulated sugar and remaining 1 tsp. lemon juice. Let sit 5 minutes for raspberries to soften. Beat cream in a medium bowl to medium-soft peaks. Divide warm peaches among bowls and top with whipped cream, raspberries, and graham cracker crumble.
