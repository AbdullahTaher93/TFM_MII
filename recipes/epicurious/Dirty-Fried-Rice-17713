Heat 1 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken livers with salt and pepper and cook until browned on the outside but still pink inside, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate and let cool. Pulse in a food processor to a coarse paste; set chicken liver paste aside. Heat remaining 1 tablespoons oil in same skillet over medium-high heat and cook onion, celery, chile, garlic, and ginger, scraping up any browned bits, until vegetables are tender, about 2 minutes. Add soy sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, crab paste, reserved chicken liver paste, and 1/4 cup water to skillet. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until a thick dry paste forms. (You should have about 1/2 cup.) Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat. Cook eggs, stirring constantly, until fluffy and just set, about 1 minute. Add rice and cook, stirring often, until rice is evenly coated and beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add shrimp and chicken-liver base and stir to coat. Cook, stirring often, until shrimp is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in jalape√±o. Serve fried rice topped with scallions, Old Bay seasoning, and MSG, if using, and drizzled with chili oil.
