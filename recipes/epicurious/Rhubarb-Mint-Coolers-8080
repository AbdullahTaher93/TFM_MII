Cut rhubarb into 1/4-inch pieces and, in a saucepan, bring to a boil with water, sugar, and mint leaves. Simmer mixture, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes (rhubarb will disintegrate) and cool 15 minutes. Pour mixture through a fine sieve into a pitcher, pressing hard on solids. Chill mixture, covered, until cold, about 3 hours, and up to 2 days. Serve coolers over ice in glasses, garnished with mint sprigs.
