Set a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until crispy and browned and the fat has rendered, about 8 minutes. Add the jalape単os to the pot and stir well. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the jalape単os are charred. Line a plate with a paper towel and use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon and jalape単os to the plate. Set aside. Add the olive oil to the pot and increase the heat to high. Add the popcorn kernels and toss well to coat them in the oil. Spread the kernels evenly on the bottom of the pot, then cover the pot with the lid. When the first kernels start to pop, very slightly uncover the pot. Shake the pot back and forth directly over the heat. Cook until the kernels stop popping, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and pour the popcorn into a large bowl. Add the reserved bacon and jalape単os, the Parmesan, and the salt. Toss well to mix. Serve warm.
