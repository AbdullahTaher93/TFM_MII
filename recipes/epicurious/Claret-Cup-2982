In a small saucepan, combine the sugar with 1/4 cup water, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it for 5 minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved. Let the sugar syrup cool completely. In a large punch bowl stir together the red wine, the Cointreau, the cr√®me de cassis, the port, the lemon juice, and the sugar syrup. Chill the mixture, covered, until it is cold. Just before serving add the club soda and the lemon and orange slices.
