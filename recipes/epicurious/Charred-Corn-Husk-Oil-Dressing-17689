Preheat broiler. Shuck corn, reserving husk; discard silk and set aside corn for another use. Place pieces of husk in a single layer on a broilerproof baking sheet. Broil until charred and blackened in spots, about 4 minutes. Let cool slightly. Purée charred husk and oil in a blender until husk is the size of confetti and oil is darkened in color. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl (you should have about 1 cup infused oil). Purée tofu, lemon juice, vinegar, honey, and 1/4 cup corn husk oil in a blender until smooth; season with salt and pepper (reserve remaining oil for another use). DO AHEAD: Charred corn husk oil can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
