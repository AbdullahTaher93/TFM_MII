Finely grind pumpkin seeds and horseradish in a food processor. Add cilantro and lime juice; pulse until cilantro is finely chopped. With motor running, stream in 1/4 cup oil; process just to combine. Add more oil if pesto is too thick; season with salt. Pesto can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill.
