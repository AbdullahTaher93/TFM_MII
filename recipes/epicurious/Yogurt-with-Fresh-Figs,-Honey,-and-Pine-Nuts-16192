Toast pine nuts in a dry small skillet over medium-low heat, tossing often, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Immediately transfer to a plate. Heat honey and rose water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until very runny, about 1 minute (do not let boil); let cool. Serve yogurt and figs drizzled with warm honey mixture and topped with pine nuts.
