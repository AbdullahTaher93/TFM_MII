Toss peaches, granulated sugar, flour, salt, and kirsch, if using, in a large bowl. Transfer to a 13x9" baking dish; set aside. Preheat oven to 350°. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat butter, almond paste, and granulated sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each. Mix in dry ingredients. Drop dollops of batter over fruit (batter will even out during baking). Sprinkle with almonds. Place baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until topping is golden brown and fruit juices are thick and bubbling, 50–60 minutes. Let cobbler sit at least 20 minutes before serving. Dust with powdered sugar and serve with ice cream.
