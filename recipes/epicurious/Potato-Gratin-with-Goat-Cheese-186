Preheat oven to 425Â°. Toss potatoes with oil and rosemary in a baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing halfway through, until potatoes are golden brown and tender, 25-30 minutes. Pierce with a paring knife, or eat one, to make sure they're ready. Remove potatoes from oven and heat broiler. Crumble cheese over potatoes and broil until cheese is golden brown and bubbling.
