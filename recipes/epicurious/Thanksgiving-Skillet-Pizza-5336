Place a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 500°F. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12" round (if dough springs back, cover with plastic and let rest 5 minutes, then roll again, resting as needed). Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high until very hot. Carefully transfer dough to skillet. Brush top of dough with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Cook, shaking pan occasionally and turning pan to avoid hot spots, until bottom of dough is golden brown and crispy, 3–4 minutes. Meanwhile, toss turkey with 1/4 cup cranberry sauce, if using, in a medium bowl. Remove skillet from heat. Using a large flat spatula, flip dough. Spread potatoes over dough, leaving a 3/4" border on all sides; season with salt and pepper. Top with 1 cup cheese, then turkey mixture, vegetables, and onion. Top with remaining 1 cup cheese and red pepper flakes, if using. Bake pizza until dough is golden brown and cheese is melted, 6–8 minutes. Transfer pizza to a cutting board and cut into wedges. Serve with additional cranberry sauce alongside, if using.
