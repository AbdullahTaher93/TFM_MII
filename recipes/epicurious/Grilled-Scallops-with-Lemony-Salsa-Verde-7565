Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Toss scallops with 2 tablespoons oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Using a fish spatula or your hands, place scallops on grill, flat side down. Grill, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Serve scallops topped with Lemony Salsa Verde .
