Preheat oven to 375°F. Combine apricots, cherries, cornstarch, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; reserve pod for another use. Toss to combine and transfer to a shallow 1 1/2-qt. baking dish. Combine crackers, butter, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Work butter into crackers with your fingers until mixture comes together. Add nuts and remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and work in with your fingers until combined. Scatter over fruit. Bake crumble until topping is golden brown and fruit is bubbling, 35–45 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.
