Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss beets with 2 Tbsp. oil in a 13-by-9–inch baking dish; season with salt. Add thyme and 1/4 cup water. Cover with foil and roast beets until a paring knife slips easily through flesh, 60–75 minutes. Let cool slightly, then rub skins from beets with paper towels; cut into 1" pieces. Toss in a large bowl with vinegar and 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt. Meanwhile, place peppers on one side of a rimmed baking sheet and pecans on the other side and roast, tossing nuts once, until peppers start to blister and pecans are slightly darkened and fragrant, 6–8 minutes. Let cool; coarsely chop. Toss peppers, pecans, and onion with beets; season with salt. Drizzle with chili oil and top with Pecorino. Beets can be roasted 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.
