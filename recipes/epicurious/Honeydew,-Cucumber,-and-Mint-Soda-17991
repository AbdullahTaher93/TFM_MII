Purée honeydew, cucumbers, mint, and salt in a blender until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl (do not press on solids, which would make mixture cloudy). Stir in lime juice and chill 1 hour. Divide honeydew purée among ice-filled glasses. Top off with club soda and garnish with mint sprigs. Honeydew purée can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
