Place the sirloin, barbecue sauce, and salt in a large bowl. Using your fingers, mix well and form the mixture into 4 patties. Fire up the grill or heat a large grill pan over high heat. Grill the burgers for 10 to 15 minutes, until they are browned on the outside but still slightly pink (but not translucent) on the inside. Top each burger with 2 tablespoons of the blue cheese. Transfer the burgers to a plate and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. Add the kale to the grill and grill for 2 to 3 minutes, turning often, until it is soft. Remove kale leaves from grill. Grill the bun halves for 30 seconds, cut side down. Remove from grill. Assemble burgers, placing grilled kale on bottom bun with the burger and top bun on top. Serve immediately.
