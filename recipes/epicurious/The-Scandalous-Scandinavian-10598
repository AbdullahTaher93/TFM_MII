To make hard-boiled eggs, place the eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let sit for 12 minutes. Rinse in cool water. When cool enough to handle, peel the eggs and rinse off any bits of shell. Cut each egg into 8 wedges. Set aside. To make the caper-onion mayonnaise, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, grainy mustard, capers, dill, red onion and black pepper in a bowl. Set aside. To assemble the sandwiches, toast the bread, if desired, and place on a work surface. For each sandwich, spread 2 teaspoons/8 grams caper-onion mayonnaise on each slice bread. Top with 1/2 cup/10 grams greens, 2 slices tomato, 2 ounces/56 grams smoked salmon and 4 wedges of egg. Sprinkle with additional dill.
