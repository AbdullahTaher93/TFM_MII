Combine buttermilk, hot sauce, salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a resealable plastic bag; add chicken. Seal bag, turn to coat, and chill at least 3 hours. DO AHEAD: Chicken can be marinated 8 hours ahead. Keep chilled. Mix butter, honey, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until smooth; set honey butter aside. Pour oil into a large skillet, preferably cast iron, to a depth of 1/2" and heat over medium-high heat until oil bubbles immediately when a little panko is added. Meanwhile, place panko in a shallow bowl. Remove chicken from marinade; season with salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in panko, shaking off excess. Working in 2 batches and maintaining oil temperature, fry chicken until golden brown, crisp, and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a paper towelâ€“lined baking sheet to drain. Split biscuits and spread each side with 1 tablespoon reserved honey butter. Build sandwiches with biscuits, chicken, and hot sauce.
