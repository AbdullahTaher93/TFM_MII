To make the dressing, place the egg yolks, garlic and mustard in a bowl and whisk until thick and creamy. Gradually add half the oil, whisking continuously until combined. Gradually add the vinegar and the remaining oil, whisking to combine. Set aside. To make the crispy kale, preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Place the kale, oil, parmesan, salt and pepper in a bowl and toss to coat. Place in a single layer on baking trays lined with non-stick baking paper. Bake for 15–20 minutes or until crisp, and set aside. Brush the chicken with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat a grill pan or barbecue over high heat. Cook the chicken for 2–3 minutes each side or until cooked through. Slice the chicken and place in a large bowl. Add the Brussels sprouts, lettuce, spinach, and pine nuts and toss to combine. Divide between serving plates and top with crispy kale and the dressing to serve.
