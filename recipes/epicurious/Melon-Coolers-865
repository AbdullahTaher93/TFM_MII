Pur√©e cantaloupe in batches with water in a blender. Transfer to a colander lined with a kitchen towel (not terry cloth) or fine cheesecloth set over a deep bowl and let drain 1 hour. Gather ends of towel and very gently squeeze any remaining juice from melon, then discard solids. Stir in lime juice, sugar, and 1/4 tsp salt and chill 1 hour. Divide among 8 (10-ounces) glasses and top off with club soda.
