Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat egg with a whisk in a medium bowl. Add peanut butter and sugar and whisk until fully incorporated and smooth. Drop mounds of dough by the tablespoonful onto prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2" apart. Lightly press tops of cookies with tines of a fork, making a crosshatch pattern. Sprinkle with salt, if using. Bake cookies, rotating trays halfway through, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool slightly. Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
