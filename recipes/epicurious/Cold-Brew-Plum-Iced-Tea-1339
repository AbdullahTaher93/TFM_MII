Combine tea bags, 3 lemon verbena sprigs, and 8 cups cold water in a large pitcher. Cover and chill at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. Meanwhile, bring sugar and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add plums and reduce heat; simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep 30 minutes. Strain plum syrup into a small bowl; stir in lemon juice. Cover and chill until cold, at least 30 minutes. Remove tea bags and lemon verbena sprigs from tea and stir in 3/4 cup plum syrup and 4 cups ice. Serve in ice-filled glasses garnished with more lemon verbena. Plum syrup can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
