1. Cook the quinoa in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, stirring or shaking the pan occasionally, until it is lightly dried out and toasted, about 15 minutes. It will make slight popping sounds as it approaches being done. To best ascertain doneness, scoop out a teaspoon, cool it slightly, and taste it. Touching it directly in the pan will not be a sure test, as the quinoa will be releasing steam. 2. Remove the skillet from the heat. Season the quinoa to taste and serve as a side or proceed with a recipe.
