Put the coconut in a large bowl. Add the rhum and allow it to soak for 1 hour. Strain off the rhum into another bowl. Place the rhum-soaked coconut in a square of cheesecloth and squeeze it into the rhum bowl. Discard the coconut. Add the sugar, vanilla bean, lemon zest, and nutmeg to the bowl. Stir to mix well. Serve over ice and garnish with slices of coconut (if desired).
