Cook potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender, 20â€“25 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to still-hot pot. Add garlic, cottage cheese, 1 1/2 cups sour cream, and all but 1/4 cup scallions. Season generously with salt and pepper and mash with a potato masher until ingredients are incorporated but mixture is still coarse. Dollop remaining sour cream over potatoes; top with remaining scallions and several generous pinches of paprika.
