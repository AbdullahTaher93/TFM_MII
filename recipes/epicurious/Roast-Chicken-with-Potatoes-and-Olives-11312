Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Pulse bay leaf, fennel seeds, and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes in spice mill until finely ground. Toss potatoes, olives, 2 tablespoons oil, and half of spice mixture in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet and rub with remaining 2 tablespoons oil; season with salt and pepper and rub with remaining spice mixture. Arrange potato mixture around chicken. Roast until potatoes are fork-tender, chicken is cooked through, and skin is crisp, 35-45 minutes. Serve chicken and potato mixture topped with parsley, lemon zest, and more red pepper flakes, if desired; spoon pan juices around.
