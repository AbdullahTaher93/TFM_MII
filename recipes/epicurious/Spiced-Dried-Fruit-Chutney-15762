Stir 1 finely chopped shallot, 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, 1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled ginger, and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped dried apricots, 1 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup coarsely chopped dried figs, 1/4 cup coarsely chopped prunes, 1/4 cup golden raisins, 1/4 cup robust-flavored (dark) molasses, and 1 1/2 cups water; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, adding more water if too thick, until fruit is soft and liquid is almost completely evaporated. Let cool.
