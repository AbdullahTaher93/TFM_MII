Prepare a grill for medium, direct heat, preferably with hardwood or hardwood charcoal. Cook maple syrup, butter, vanilla, and salt in a small skillet over low heat, whisking occasionally, until butter is melted. Grill apricots cut side down, brushing with syrup mixture as they cook, until lightly charred and tender, 8â€“10 minutes. Transfer to a platter cut side up, and brush with additional syrup mixture. Let apricots cool to room temperature, then serve with ice cream.
