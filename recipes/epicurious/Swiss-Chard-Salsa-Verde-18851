Remove ribs and stems from chard leaves and reserve. Finely chop leaves (you should have about 1 3/4 cups); thinly slice ribs and stems crosswise. Combine chard leaves and ribs and stems, shallot, oil, chives, vinegar, and lemon zest in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Add more vinegar or oil, if desired.
