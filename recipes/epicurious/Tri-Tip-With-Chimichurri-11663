Mix sesame seeds, paprika, 2 Tbsp. oil, 2 tsp. salt, and 2 tsp. pepper in a small bowl to combine. Rub all over steak and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Place steak over indirect heat, cover grill, and grill, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 115°F, 20–30 minutes. Move steak to direct heat and grill until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 120°F for medium-rare (temperature will continue to rise off heat). Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain. While steak is resting, combine garlic, parsley, cilantro, vinegar, agave nectar, and remaining 1/2 cup oil; season with salt and pepper. Serve steak with chimichurri.
