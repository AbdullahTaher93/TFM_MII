Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Line 10 cups in a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners, or grease them well with coconut oil. In a large bowl, mix together the brown rice flour, almond flour, arrowroot, Sucanat, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center, then add the maple syrup, orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla. Gradually stir the dry ingredients into the wet ones, mixing just until blended. Stir in the almonds and coconut. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, filling them two- thirds full, and smooth the top of each muffin. Bake for 12 to 16 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Cool the muffins in the pan set on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.
