Place a wok over high heat and add the oil. Toss in the green onions and stir them around to release their fragrance. Before they start to brown, add the bamboo shoot and soybeans. Toss these in the hot oil for about 1 minute to heat them through, then add the salted greens. Toss these together for about 30 seconds and then add the rice cakes. After you stir-fry the rice cakes for a minute or so, pour the rice wine and boiling water around the edge of the wok. Continue to toss the rice cakes until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Serve hot in bowls.
