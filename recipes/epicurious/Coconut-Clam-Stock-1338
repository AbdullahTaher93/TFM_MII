Heat oil in a large pot over medium-low. Add onion, fennel, lemongrass, and bay leaves. Cover and cook, checking and stirring halfway through to ensure no browning occurs, until softened, 8–10 minutes. (The flavor won't be ruined if the vegetables take on color, but the stock will end up grayish.) Add clams and wine and increase heat to medium-high. Cover and cook until clams open, 12–15 minutes. Add coconut milk and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing on solids; discard solids. Season stock with salt. Blend with an immersion blender until smooth and emulsified, if desired.
