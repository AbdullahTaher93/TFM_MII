Cutting along seams where lamb leg naturally separates, portion into 4 large pieces, trimming any excess fat and sinew. Rub lamb with oil and Herb Salt. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour before grilling. Prepare a grill for high heat. Grill lamb, turning often, until lightly charred and an instant-read thermometer registers 130°, 20–30 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes. Thinly slice against the grain and serve with Anchovy Mayonnaise. Do ahead: Lamb can be seasoned 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
