In a blender purée 1 cup of the raspberries with the milk, strain the purée through a coarse sieve into a glass measure, pressing hard on the solids, and return it to the blender, cleaned. Add the ice cream, the peaches and the sugar, blend the mixture until it is smooth but still thick, and serve the milk shakes garnished with the additional raspberries.
