Preheat broiler. Mash egg yolks with mayonnaise, horseradish, vinegar, and mustard in a medium bowl until smooth. Season with salt and spoon back into egg whites. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over. Place eggs on a broiler-proof baking sheet and broil, watching closely to prevent burning, until breadcrumbs are toasted, about 3 minutes. DO AHEAD: Deviled eggs can be filled (not sprinkled with breadcrumbs) up to 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
