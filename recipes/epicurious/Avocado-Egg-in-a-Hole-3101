Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Place the halves face up on a muffin tin so they won't tip over. Pour the beaten egg into each hole (one egg fills two halves). Sprinkle with grated cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Bake at 375Â° F for 15 to 20 minutes or until desired egg hardness.
