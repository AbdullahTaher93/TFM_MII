Combine the juices, garlic, dried oregano, cumin (optional), and black pepper for the marinade in a blender and process until smooth. Set aside until ready to use. Place the pork in a large roasting pan. With the tip of a sharp knife, make numerous
incisions into the meat (do not score the skin). Toss the marinade over the pork, cover
with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to marinate overnight, turning the meat
several times if possible. Preheat the oven to 250째F. Bring the pork to room temperature. Remove the meat from the marinade, pat it dry,
and reserve the marinade. Place the pork skin-side up inside the roasting pan and add the
marinade back into the roasting pan. Cover the pork with aluminum foil and insert into
the oven. Cook for 8 to 9 hours until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 170째F to
190째F near the bone, shreds easily, and the liquid runs clear when the meat is pierced. To get crisp skin, remove the pork from the oven and turn the oven up to 450째F.
Once the oven is preheated, remove the foil from the pork and put it back in the oven.
Check the pork every few minutes so the skin does not burn. Remove the pork when it has
crisped nicely, 15 to 30 minutes total. Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest 15 to 20 minutes before carving.
Discard the braising liquid. Serve in chunks and drizzle with Mojo Criollo sauce.
