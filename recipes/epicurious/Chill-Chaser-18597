In a bowl, beat the egg yolks until they are thick and light. Warm the honey and add it, in a stream, stirring constantly. Beat in the scalded milk and orange-flavored liqueur. Divide the mixture among six 10-ounce, heat-proof mugs, rinsed with boiling water, and garnish each drink with grated orange rind.
