Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium. Cook shallot and ginger, stirring occasionally, until shallot is translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in cinnamon and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in orange, figs, sugar, vinegar, mustard, and 1/2 cup water and bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add cranberries and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until cranberries burst and liquid is reduced to a light syrup, 12â€“18 minutes. Let cool slightly; season with salt and pepper. Chutney can be made 1 week ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
