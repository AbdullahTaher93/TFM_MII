Heat oil in a large skillet with a lid or braising pan over medium. Cook bacon until fat starts to render, about 5 minutes. Add shallots and cook until shallots are soft and fat is rendered from bacon, 8â€“10 minutes. Increase heat to high and add wine, garlic, and rosemary. Cook, stirring, until wine is reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, chicken stock, salt, and red pepper flakes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and nestle chicken pieces, skin side up, in sauce. Top with kale, cover, and cook until kale is wilted, about 6 minutes. Stir kale into sauce and cook, uncovered, until chicken is warmed through, about 5 minutes more. Serve with bread.
