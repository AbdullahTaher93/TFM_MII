Combine shallot, lemon zest, lemon juice, and 1/4 tsp. kosher salt in a medium bowl. Let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toast pistachios, 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and 1 tsp. za'atar in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Season with 1/4 tsp. kosher salt. Transfer to a small bowl; let cool and set aside. Add honey and 1 tsp. za'atar to lemon mixture and whisk to combine, then whisk in 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Place frisée, carrots, parsley, 3/4 cup grapes, and half of the pistachios in a large bowl and drizzle with vinaigrette. Gently toss until frisée is evenly dressed; season with sea salt and pepper. Top with remaining pistachios and 3/4 cup grapes.
