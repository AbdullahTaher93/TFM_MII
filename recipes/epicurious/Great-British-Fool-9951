1 To make the compote, preheat the oven to 350Â°F. 2 Place the fruit in a large saucepan and sprinkle with the sugar. Add enough water to just cover and bring the mixture to a boil, letting, allowing the sugar to dissolve. Let the mixture simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the fruit has completely softened. 3 Add the syrup, if using (elderflower works very well with gooseberries, and ginger is great with rhubarb). Check the compote for sweetness and add more sugar if you desire. Allow the compote to cool, then chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. 4 Whisk the cream and confectioners' sugar together until soft peaks form (it should not be too thick), then fold in the compote. Divide the fool among 6 decorative glasses and serve.
