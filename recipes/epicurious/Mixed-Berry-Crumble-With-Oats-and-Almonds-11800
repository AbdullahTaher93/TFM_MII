Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 375°F/ Gas Mark 5. Put the filling ingredients into a pan over low heat and cook for about 4 minutes or until the fruit just begins to soften. Tip the fruit into an ovenproof dish and set this aside. Put the oats, ground almonds, dates, butter, 2 teaspoons of the ground ginger and the vanilla seeds into a bowl and, using your fingertips, rub this gently together to just combine so everything is evenly mixed in. Tip the crumble topping over the fruit and then sprinkle over the remaining 1 teaspoon of ground ginger. Pop into the oven and cook for about 25 minutes or until the crumble is just going golden brown. Once cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool for a few minutes before serving.
