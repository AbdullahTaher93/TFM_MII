Whisk chiles, tamarind, brown sugar, salt, and 1 tablespoon oil in a shallow baking dish until sugar is dissolved. Add steak and turn to coat. Cover and chill at least 4 hours. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Working in 2 batches and adding remaining 2 teaspoons oil between batches, cook steak until deeply browned, 2â€“4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to a cutting board; let rest at least 5 minutes before slicing. DO AHEAD: Steak can be marinated 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
