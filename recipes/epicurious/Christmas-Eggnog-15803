Beat the egg whites until stiff, gradually adding in 3/4 cup sugar. Set aside. Beat the egg yolks until they are thick and pale and add the other 3/4 cup sugar and stir in rye whiskey. Blend well. Fold the egg white mixture into the yolk mixture and add the brandy and the rum. Beat the mixture well. To serve, fold the lightly whipped heavy cream into the eggnog. (If a thinner mixture is desired, add the heavy cream unwhipped.) Sprinkle the top of the eggnog with the nutmeg to taste.
