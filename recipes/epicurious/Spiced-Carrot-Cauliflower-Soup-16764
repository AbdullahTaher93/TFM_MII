Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook the onions for 3 minutes, or until soft. Dissolve the vegetable bouillon in the water and add to the pot. Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are fork tender. Using an immersion blender or standing blender, puree all of the ingredients until smooth.
