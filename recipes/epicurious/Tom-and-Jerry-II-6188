Beat the egg yolk until it is pale and light and add the maple sugar, allspice, and the golden rum. Beat the mixture until it is smooth and light. Blend in the egg white, stiffly beaten, and the Cognac or bourbon. Pour the mixture into a warmed mug and fill the mug with hot milk or water or a mixture of both. Stir the drink well, sprinkle it with freshly grated nutmeg, and serve it at once.
