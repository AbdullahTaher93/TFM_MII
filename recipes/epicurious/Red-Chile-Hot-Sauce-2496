Pulse Fresno and habanero chiles, garlic, and 2 Tbsp. salt in a food processor until very finely chopped. Transfer to a small bowl; cover and let sit at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours (this will both develop the chile flavor and soften the flesh, resulting in a smooth flavorful sauce when puréed). Purée chile mixture and vinegar in a blender until smooth. Season with salt. Sauce can be made 2 months ahead. Cover and chill.
