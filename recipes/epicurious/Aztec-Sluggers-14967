Heat coffee, bourbon, Kahl√∫a, chocolate, and 2 tablespoons cream in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over low heat, whisking constantly, until chocolate is melted, about 1 to 2 minutes. (Do not let boil.) Whisk remaining 1/4 cup cream with sugar until it holds soft peaks. Divide coffee mixture between 2 large mugs, then top with whipped cream.
