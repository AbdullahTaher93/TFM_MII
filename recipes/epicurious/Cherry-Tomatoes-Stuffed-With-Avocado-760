Cut thin slices from the tops of the cherry tomatoes. With a small melon ball cutter, scoop out and discard the seeds and pulp. Sprinkle the insides of the shells lightly with sugar and salt and invert the shells on paper towels to drain for at least 30 minutes. In a bowl, mash avocados with sour cream, parsley, lime juice, lemon juice, chives, 1/4 tsp. salt, hot pepper sauce, and 1/4 tsp sugar. Using a small knife, fill the tomato shells with avocado mixture. Arrange the tomatoes on a serving dish and serve them chilled.
