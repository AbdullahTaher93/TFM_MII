Pulse garlic, cilantro, parsley, cumin, fenugreek, and 2 teaspoons salt in a food processor until similar in texture to pesto. Add tahini and lemon juice; process 30 seconds (mixture will be very thick and gray). With motor running, gradually drizzle in 3/4 cup water and process, adding more water to thin if needed, until sauce is light green and the consistency of sour cream. Season with salt.
