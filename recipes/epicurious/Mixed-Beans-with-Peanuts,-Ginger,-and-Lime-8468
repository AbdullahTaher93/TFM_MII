Working in batches by type, cook beans in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, 1â€“4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice water; let cool. Drain and pat dry. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet over medium and cook shallot, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3 minutes. Add ginger, lemongrass, garlic, and coriander and cook, stirring, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium-high. Cook peanuts, tossing often, until golden brown and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels; let cool, then coarsely chop. Set aside 1 tablespoon peanuts for serving. Whisk kaffir lime leaves, lime zest, lime juice, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil into shallot mixture. Add beans, remaining peanuts, and 1/3 cup cilantro and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with more cilantro and reserved peanuts.
