Place the peels in a glass pitcher or bowl with the sugar (save the lemons for juicing). Muddle the peels until the sugar looks slightly moistened, then cover and let sit for at least 1 hour, or overnight. Add the lemon, cucumber, grapefruit, and orange wheels, Pimm's, orange juice, and lemon juice. Stir until the sugar has completely dissolved and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. You can make this the night before to cut your workload down on New Year's Eve. When you are ready to serve, transfer the mixture (including the fruit) to a punch bowl and slowly add the Champagne and the ice. Garnish the bowl with the strawberry slices. To serve, ladle into punch glasses. This punch can also be served Sangria-style in a pitcher and poured over ice.
