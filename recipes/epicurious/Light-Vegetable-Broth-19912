Combine all ingredients in large pot. Bring to boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until vegetables are very soft and broth is pale golden, stirring occasionally and adjusting heat if necessary to maintain low simmer, about 45 minutes. Season to taste with more salt, if desired. Strain broth through colander; discard vegetables. Strain broth again through fine-mesh strainer. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cool, cover, and refrigerate.
