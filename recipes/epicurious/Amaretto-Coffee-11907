In each of the four 8-ounce mugs combine 2 tablespoons of the amaretto, 1 tablespoon of the brandy, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar, divide the coffee, heated if necessary, among the mugs, and stir the drinks until the sugar is dissolved. Top each drink with a dollop of the whipped cream and sprinkle the whipped cream with the almonds.
