Combine mirin, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and garlic in a large resealable plastic bag and add chicken. Seal bag, turn to coat, and chill 2–12 hours. Preheat oven to 350°F. Pour oil into a large cast-iron skillet to come 1" up sides. Heat over medium-high until an instant-read thermometer registers 350°F. Remove chicken from marinade, letting excess drip off; season all over with salt and pepper. Combine flour, 2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a shallow bowl or large resealable plastic bag; toss chicken in flour mixture to coat. Working with 5 pieces of chicken at a time, remove chicken from flour, shaking off excess, and fry, turning, until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Lay chicken skin side up on a wire rack placed inside a rimmed baking sheet and bake until cooked through, 10–15 minutes. Season with salt.
