Combine bananas, brown sugar, vanilla, a pinch of salt, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until bananas are jammy and liquid is slightly thickened, 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine berries, lime juice, granulated sugar, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Mash berries lightly to release juices. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until juices are slightly thickened, 15–20 minutes. Stir coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk in a small bowl to combine. Assemble halo-halo in 2 small bowls or pint glasses, alternating layers of bananas, berries, shaved ice, ice cream, and coconut milk mixture. Top as desired.
