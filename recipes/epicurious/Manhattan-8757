In chilled cocktail shaker or pint glass, combine Angostura and orange bitters, vermouth, and rye whiskey. Add ice and stir until well chilled, about 20 seconds. Strain into chilled martini or coupe glass. Squeeze orange peel over drink, making sure oils fall into glass, then discard peel. Thread cherry onto skewer, place in drink, and serve.
