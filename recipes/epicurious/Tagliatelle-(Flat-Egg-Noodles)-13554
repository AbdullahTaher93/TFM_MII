Make pasta all'uovo . When the dough has rested, roll it out with a wooden rolling pin into a thin sheet less than 1/16 inch (1 millimeter) thick. If you use a pasta machine to roll the dough, finish at the smallest setting. If this is too thin for you to handle, stop at the next-to-last setting instead. Nobody will care. Spread the pasta sheet out on the board and roll it loosely like a jellyroll. With a large, sharp knife, cut the roll at less than 1/4-inch (5-millimeter) intervals. You can also use a pasta machine to cut the noodles. In that case, trim the sheet into regular lengths up to 24 inches (60 centimeters). Feed the sheets through the cutting attachment. Fluff the noodles gently with your fingers and set them down in little heaps on floured kitchen towels. Let them dry a bitâ€”just enough so the pieces don't stick together.
