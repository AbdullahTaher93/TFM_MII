Using your hands, gently mix onion, beef, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Gently shape into four 1 1/2"-thick patties (loosely formed patties will be more succulent). Heat oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high heat. Season patties with salt and pepper, place in skillet, and immediately reduce heat to medium. Cook 4â€“6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Serve on buns with desired toppings. DO AHEAD: Patties can be formed 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
