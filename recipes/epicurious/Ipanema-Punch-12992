In a large bowl, combine the Cointreau, rum, cr√®me de banane, grapefruit juice, orange juice, lime juice, and pineapple juice. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight. Pour the mixture into a punch bowl or large pitcher. Add the frozen berries (as "ice cubes"). Top with ginger ale and stir gently to blend. Garnish each glass.
