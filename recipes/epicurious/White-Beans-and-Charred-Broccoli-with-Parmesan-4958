Drain beans and place in a large heavy pot. Remove rind from Parmesan and add rind along with onion and garlic to beans. Pour in water to cover by 2"; season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, adding water as needed to keep beans submerged, until beans are tender, about 2 hours. Let cool. Discard vegetables and Parmesan rind, then drain. Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Toss broccoli with 1/4 cup oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing occasionally, until tender and lightly charred, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool. Finely chop half of broccoli and toss in a large bowl with anchovies, lemon zest, lemon juice, and beans. Shave half of Parmesan over and add remaining broccoli and 1/4 cup oil; toss and season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. Shave remaining Parmesan over.
