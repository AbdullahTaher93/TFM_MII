Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter a shallow 2-quart baking dish. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add breadcrumbs; cook, stirring often, until golden brown, 5—7 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and toss with 1/2 cup Parmesan and 1 tablespoon thyme leaves; season with salt and pepper. Bring cream, broth, thyme sprigs, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat; season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit 10 minutes; discard thyme. Cover and keep warm. Toss vegetables and garlic in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Arrange 1/3 of vegetables in dish and top with 1/2 cup Parmesan. Repeat layers; top with remaining vegetables. Pour cream mixture over; place a piece of parchment paper directly on top of vegetables. Bake until vegetables are crisp-tender and cream is thickened, 50–60 minutes. Uncover, top with breadcrumbs, and bake until gratin is bubbling and breadcrumbs are brown, 15–20 minutes longer. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.
