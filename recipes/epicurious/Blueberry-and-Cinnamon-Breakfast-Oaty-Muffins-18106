Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a muffin tin with 12 paper muffin cases. Put 1 1/4 cups of the oats into a food processor and
blitz them until they form a fine powder. Then add
the almond milk, dates, egg, baking powder, and
cinnamon and blitz together to give a fairly smooth
and sloppy mixture. Tip the mixture into a large bowl and gently stir in
the blueberries until well mixed through. Divide the
mixture evenly among the 12 muffin cases. I like to
use a mechanical ice cream scoop to do this. Sprinkle over the remaining oats and bake in the
oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until the muffins are
cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave to cool a little
before tucking in.
