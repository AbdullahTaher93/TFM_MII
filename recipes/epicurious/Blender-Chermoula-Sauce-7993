Toast coriander and cumin seeds in a dry small skillet, tossing occasionally, until very fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool, then lightly crush with a heavy skillet. Pur√©e toasted seeds, garlic, oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, paprika, salt, and red pepper flakes in a blender until spices are ground and mixture is very smooth. Add cilantro, parsley, and mint; process until well combined but slightly textured. Sauce can be made 3 days ahead; chill in an airtight container.
