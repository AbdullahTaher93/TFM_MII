Gently warm the oil through in a heavy-based pan but do not allow it to boil. Bring to a gentle simmer, then add the chilli, lemon grass, garlic and ginger. Continue to simmer very gently for 20â€“30 minutes, until the flavours are well infused. It's important not to allow it to boil at any stage. Pour into a squeezy bottle, leaving the bits in, as the flavours will continue to infuse. Use as required.
