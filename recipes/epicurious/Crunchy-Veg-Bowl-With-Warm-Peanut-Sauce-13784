Pulse chiles, garlic, peanut butter, coconut milk, brown sugar, lime juice, soy sauce, and fish sauce in a blender until smooth. Transfer peanut sauce to a small saucepan and add 1/4 cup water (if too thick, add a splash or so of water as needed). Heat over medium-low, whisking often, until smooth and hot, about 5 minutes; season with salt. Keep warm over low heat, whisking occasionally. Cook eggs in a large saucepan of boiling water 7 minutes (whites will be set and yolks still slightly soft). Drain; transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water and chill until cold. Drain and peel; set aside. Toss cabbage, scallions, beet, celery, cucumber, sprouts, cilantro, and mint in a large bowl to combine; season with salt. Top with peanuts. Serve salad with brown rice and eggs, drizzled with some peanut sauce, with more sauce on the side. Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Reheat in a small saucepan over medium-low, whisking often, until warm.
