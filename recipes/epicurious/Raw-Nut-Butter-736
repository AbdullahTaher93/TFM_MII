Put the nuts in a food processor and process for 20–30 minutes, stopping and scraping down the side as needed every 5 minutes. This takes more time than you’d expect, so be patient! It’s ready when the oils have released from the nuts and the consistency is like smooth butter. Stir in the raw cacao to make a delicious chocolate spread. Transfer to a glass jar, seal, and store in the fridge.
