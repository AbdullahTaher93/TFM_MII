Put chocolate in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, combine cream, coffee, and cinnamon stick; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Pour hot cream mixture over chocolate. Let stand, undisturbed, for about 2 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick; whisk until chocolate is completely melted and mixture is blended and smooth.
