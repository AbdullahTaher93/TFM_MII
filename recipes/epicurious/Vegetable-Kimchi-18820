In a large bowl, toss together vegetables, salt, and sugar. Let sit at room temperature 1â€“3 hours for juices to release. Add scallions, gochugaru, garlic, fish sauce, and ginger; toss to coat. Divide kimchi between two 1-qt. jars, distributing liquid evenly and leaving 1" headspace. Eat immediately or let sit on countertop 2 days to allow fermentation to begin before refrigerating. Flavors will deepen over time. Kimchi can be made 2 months in advance. Open occasionally to release gases.
