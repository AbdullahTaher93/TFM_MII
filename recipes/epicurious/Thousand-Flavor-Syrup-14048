Bring 1/4 cup sugar and 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat and scrape in seeds from 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, then add pod along with 3 wide strips lemon zest, 3 lightly crushed green cardamom pods, 1 star anise pod, 5 juniper berries, 1/4 cup dried rose petals, 2 tablespoons dried hibiscus flowers or hibiscus tea, 1 teaspoon pink peppercorns, and 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns. Let syrup sit until flavors are infused, 20â€“25 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl; discard solids. Chill until cold, then cover. Syrup can be made 4 days ahead. Keep chilled.
