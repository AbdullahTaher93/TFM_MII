Prepare grill for medium-high heat. Place rosemary and thyme sprigs on a plate and microwave on high until brittle, about 2 minutes. Rub steaks with oil, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with herbs, crushing gently and pressing to adhere. Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix ponzu, carrot, and daikon in a small bowl. Top steaks with rosemary and thyme leaves; serve with dipping sauce.
