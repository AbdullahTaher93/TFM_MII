Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Mix cranberry sauce, mustard, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Spread relish over 1 side of each slice of bread. Melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a medium ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Place 1 slice of bread, plain side down, in skillet and cook until just golden on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Scatter 3/4 cup cheese over and slightly around bread (the cheese in contact with the pan will begin to melt immediately). Transfer skillet to oven and bake until cheese is golden brown around edges, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from oven and top bread with a few slices of ham; let sandwich cool slightly in pan 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, carefully loosen edges of cheese and transfer sandwich to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter, bread, cheese, and ham to make 3 more sandwiches. Wipe out skillet. Heat oil in same skillet over medium. Crack eggs into skillet, cover, and cook until whites are just set but yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Top each sandwich with a fried egg; season with salt and pepper.
