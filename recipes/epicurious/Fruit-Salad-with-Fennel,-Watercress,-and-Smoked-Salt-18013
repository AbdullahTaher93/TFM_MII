Whisk oil, lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl to combine; set aside. Toss melon, pluot, cherries, and vinegar in medium bowl. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until fruit is lightly pickled, 10–15 minutes; drain. Toss fennel, frisée, and watercress with half of vinaigrette in a large bowl. Arrange grapefruits on a serving platter; sprinkle with smoked salt. Top with pickled fruit and scatter dressed fennel salad over. Serve salad drizzled with remaining lemon vinaigrette and sprinkled with smoked salt and pepper.
