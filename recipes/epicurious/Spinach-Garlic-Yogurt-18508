Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add half of spinach and cook, tossing often, until just wilted; transfer to a colander and let cool. Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining spinach. Squeeze spinach well to remove excess water, then coarsely chop. Mix chopped spinach, garlic, yogurt, cilantro, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium bowl; season with salt. Cover and chill at least 1 hour before serving. DO AHEAD: Spinach-garlic yogurt can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled (garlic flavor will intensify as it sits).
