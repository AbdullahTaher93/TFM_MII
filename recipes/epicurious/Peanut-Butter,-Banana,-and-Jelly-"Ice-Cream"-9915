Cut bananas into 1/2" slices. Arrange in a single layer on a large plate or rimmed baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 1 1/2 hours. Purée banana slices in a food processor, scraping down bowl as needed, until mixture becomes creamy, about 3 minutes. Add peanut butter and 3 Tbsp. water; purée until smooth, about 2 minutes more. Drizzle jelly over banana mixture, then pulse a few more times to just incorporate jelly and create a speckled appearance. Divide ice cream among serving bowls and serve immediately. Banana slices can be frozen up to a day in advance.
