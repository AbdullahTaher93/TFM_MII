Bring carrots, 2 Tbsp. sugar, and 1/4 cup water to a simmer in a medium skillet over medium-low heat, stirring to separate carrots. Cook until carrots are soft, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium and cook, stirring, until liquid is reduced to a thick syrup (if syrup starts to color, reduce heat). Add several generous pinches of sugar, tossing constantly, then cook, tossing, until carrots are coated. Spread out on a parchment-lined baking sheet and let cool. Separate carrots with your fingers and toss each piece in more sugar to coat. Carrots can be made 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Toss in sugar before using.
