Place the anchovies in a small shallow bowl and cover them with milk. Let them sit for 15 minutes. Drain, quickly rinse with water and pat dry. Place all the ingredients in a mortar and pestle (or in a food processor) and either mix or process to form a thick puree. With the processor running, add the oil in a thin stream until it is thoroughly incorporated into the mixture. Taste for seasoning, and adjust if necessary. To make Tuna Tapenade, poach 4 ounces fresh tuna in water seasoned with fresh thyme, garlic, shallot, and fresh parsley, until it is opaque, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the tuna from the poaching liquid and let it cool to room temperature before crumbling into the tapenade. For Basil Tapenade, mince 1 cup fresh basil leaves and fold them into the tapenade right before serving. For Fresh Thyme Tapenade, add 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves to the tapenade right before serving.
