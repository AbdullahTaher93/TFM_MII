Mix 2 cups plain whole-milk or 2% Greek yogurt and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl. Line a fine-mesh sieve with 2 layers of cheesecloth and set over a medium bowl. Place yogurt mixture in sieve, cover with plastic wrap, and let drain in refrigerator at least 1 day and up to 2, if you want it slightly thicker. Discard excess liquid.
