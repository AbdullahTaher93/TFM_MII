In the slow cooker, stir together the chicken stock, lemongrass, lime rind, Tom Yum paste, mushrooms, and Thai chiles. Cook on low for 6 hours, or on high for 2 hours. Adjust the heat to high, and add the shrimp, fish sauce, lime juice, and palm sugar, and cook for 10 minutes more, or until the shrimp are uniformly pink. Ladle the soup into a tureen or individual bowls, garnish with the cilantro, and serve.
