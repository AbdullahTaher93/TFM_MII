1. Season the fish with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, whisk together the quinoa flour, toasted quinoa, baking powder, cornstarch, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Whisk in the club soda to make a batter. The consistency will be thick and it should cling to the fish, but it may dry out as it rests, in which case, whisk in a little more club soda. 2. Line a large plate with 2 layers of paper towels. Add enough oil to a large skillet to reach 1 inch/2.5 centimeters up the sides of the skillet and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. 3. Dip each piece of fish, one at a time, in the batter and add to the skillet. Cook until deep golden and crusty on both sides, about 10 minutes total. You can add a few pieces of fish to the skillet, but avoid overcrowding. 4. Transfer the cooked fish to the prepared plate and repeat with the remaining fish. Add more oil if needed, allowing it to heat prior to adding more fish. Serve hot with lemon wedges, lime wedges, or malt vinegar.
