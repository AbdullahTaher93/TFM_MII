Cook oil, red pepper flakes, and fennel seeds in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until oil around spices is sizzling, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook until oil is infused with flavor and rusty-orange in color, 20â€“30 minutes. Let cool. Arrange tomatoes on a large platter and drizzle with vinegar, then chile-fennel oil. Season with more vinegar if desired and sprinkle with salt.
