In a large pot, combine sugar with 8 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the cinnamon, cloves, vanilla, star anise, and lemon, stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the pears to the liquid and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer the pears until tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let the pears cool in their liquid at room temperature. When ready to serve, use a slotted spoon to transfer pears to serving platter. Top with a dollop of crème fraîche, amaretti cookie crumbs, and a light dusting of cinnamon.
