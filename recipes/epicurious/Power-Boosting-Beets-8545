Cut two wafer-thin slices off one of the beet halves and reserve. Feed the beet and carrots, then the celery and cucumber, and finally the apples through a juicer. Stir in the walnuts. Fill a glass halfway with ice (if using), then pour in the juice. Thread the beet slices through a toothpick, lay it on top of the glass, and serve immediately.
