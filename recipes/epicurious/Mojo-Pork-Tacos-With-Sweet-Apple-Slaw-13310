Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a medium bowl, reserving 1 Tbsp. olive oil. Put the pork loin in a large ziplock bag with the marinade, seal and massage the marinade into the pork. Put the bag in the fridge and marinate for at least 5 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Heat reserved​ 1 Tbsp. oil in a large ovenproof frying pan over medium heat. Remove the pork from the bag and allow the excess marinade to drip away. Cook the pork, turning frequently, for 5 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides. Put the pan in the oven and cook for 7 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted into the meat reads 143–149°F. Remove from the oven and rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Put the apple, cabbage, garlic, chile, spring onion, and cilantro in a medium bowl. Pour over the vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Assembling a taco is a very personal thing so I’m not going to tell you how to make yours, but here’s how I do mine: I preheat the oven to 350°F. I wrap my tortillas in foil with the dry herbs and stick them in the oven. I get my warm tortilla, put down a layer of avocado slices, then a layer of pork, and then spoon on the epic slaw. I wrap it up and there’s no holding back. So get in there like a shot of tequila and make a mess!
