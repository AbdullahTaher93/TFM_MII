Toss the strawberries with the salt, lemon juice, and sugar. Pour into a cast-iron skillet 10 inches wide or larger and set the skillet on the hearth grate or nestle the skillet right in the embers as long as the fire is not too hot. You can also put the skillet over the grate in your fire pit. After 3 minutes, toss the berries in the pan, and then return the pan to the grate or embers. The berries are done when they are soft and syrupy, after about 5 minutes.
