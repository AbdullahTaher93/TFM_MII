Pur√©e 4 pounds chopped tomatoes, 1/2 pound chopped Persian or English hothouse cucumbers, 1 chopped celery stalk, and 2 tablespoons prepared white horseradish in a blender until smooth. Strain through a cheesecloth-lined fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Let drain, without stirring, until 3 cups of liquid are collected, about 2 hours; discard solids in strainer. Season to taste with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and sugar. Divide tomato water among 6 ice-filled glasses. Top each glass with 2 tablespoons (or more) vodka. Garnish with lemon slices and cucumber spears.
