Spread both sides of each roll with mustard. Layer the bottom half with ham, pork, and
cheese to cover the bread from end to end. Top with sliced pickles to taste. Brush the outside
of the bread, both top and bottom, with butter. Heat a sandwich press over medium heat. Lightly brush the inside of the press with
additional butter. Press the sandwich until the cheese is melted and the meats are warm,
3 to 5 minutes. Alternately, heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Create a press by
wrapping a brick, heavy skillet, or can of soup in aluminum foil. Place the sandwich in
the skillet and press down on the sandwich, turning once, until it is warmed through and
the outside crust is golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches.
Slice on the diagonal and serve.
