Bring vinegar, brown sugar, cloves, star anise, salt, mustard powder, mustard seeds, peppercorns, and 2 cups water to a boil in a medium pot over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Place squash in a heatproof resealable container or jar (divide among several containers if necessary). Pour hot brining liquid over squash. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and chill at least 2 hours before serving.
