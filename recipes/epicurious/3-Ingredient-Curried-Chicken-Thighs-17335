Season chicken with 1 tsp. salt. Whisk oil, curry powder, and 1/2 cup yogurt in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag and chill at least 3 hours. Position a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Transfer chicken, skin side up, and marinade to a 13x9" baking dish. Roast chicken until skin is browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted near bone registers 165°F, 30–35 minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter, reserving pan juices. Skim off excess fat from juices with a spoon, then transfer 1/4 cup juices to a small bowl. Whisk in remaining 1/2 cup yogurt; season with remaining 1/2 tsp. salt. Serve alongside chicken. Chicken can be marinated 1 day ahead; keep chilled.
