Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over medium-high. Cook carrots, half of the onion, and 3 sliced garlic cloves, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add chicken carcass, if using, and broth; cover and simmer 30 minutes. (If you're not using carcass, simmer 15 minutes.) Meanwhile, toast farro in another large pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it starts to brown and smells nutty, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 tsp. salt and 3 cups water. Cover and simmer until farro is tender and liquid evaporates, about 30 minutes; strain any remaining liquid, if necessary. Set aside 2 cups farro for Dill-Crusted Pork Tenderloin or reserve for another use. Strain chicken broth mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; discard carcass and vegetables. Set aside 2 cups broth for Potato, Leek, and Pea Pot Pie or reserve for another use. Wipe out pot, then heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil over low. Cook remaining onion and 9 sliced garlic cloves, stirring occasionally, until tender and light golden, 8–10 minutes. Add remaining broth left in bowl, increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Add reserved chicken meat, beans, kale, lemon juice, pepper, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. salt and farro left in pot; cook until vegetables are cooked through, 3–5 minutes. Divide soup among bowls. Stir 1 Tbsp. salsa verde into each bowl, if using, and sprinkle with dill. Serve with baguette slices and lemon wedges alongside. Soup can be made 2 days ahead. Chill in a resealable container.
