Light a grill or preheat a grill pan and oil the grates. Lightly brush both sides of the zucchini bread slices with oil, sprinkle with sugar, and grill over moderately high heat, turning once, until dark brown grill marks form on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the zucchini bread to plates and top with a dollop or two of mascarpone. Spoon the berries on top and serve.
