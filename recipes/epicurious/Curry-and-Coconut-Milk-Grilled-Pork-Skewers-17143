Bring coconut milk, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, salt, pepper, curry powder, and turmeric to a boil in a medium saucepan, stirring occasionally; reduce heat and simmer until sauce is bubbling and flavors have melded, 10â€“15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; let cool slightly, then stir in condensed milk. Taste sauce; it should be sweet, salty, and peppery. Season with salt and pepper if needed. Add pork and toss, massaging meat with your hands. Cover and chill 1 hour. Prepare grill for medium-high heat. Thread a piece of fatback onto middle of each skewer, then thread on a piece of pork so one end of pork touches fat and other is at pointy end of skewer. Grill, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and cooked through, about 4 minutes.
