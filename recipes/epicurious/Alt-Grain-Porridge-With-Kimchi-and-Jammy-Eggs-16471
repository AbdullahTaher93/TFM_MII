Pulse spelt in a blender or food processor until coarsely chopped (all of the grains should be broken open but not ground to a powder). Combine spelt and 4 cups water in a large saucepan over medium-high; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, whisking occasionally, until spelt is tender and mixture is thick, 25â€“35 minutes. Whisk in Parmesan and butter. Add water by tablespoonfuls if needed to loosen. Just before porridge is done, cook eggs in a small saucepan of boiling water 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of ice water and let sit just until warm. Carefully peel and slice in half lengthwise. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium. Cook kimchi, tossing, just until slightly darkened and warmed through, about 1 minute. Divide grain porridge among bowls. Divide kimchi and eggs over top.
