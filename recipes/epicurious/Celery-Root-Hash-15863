Cook celery root, sweet potatoes, thyme, bay leaf, chicken broth, oil, and cayenne pepper in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, tossing occasionally, until vegetables are just beginning to soften and liquid is evaporated, 15–20 minutes. Add onion and garlic; season with salt and black pepper and cook, tossing often and scraping up any browned bits, until vegetables are tender, 30–35 minutes. Remove thyme and bay leaf and toss in bacon. Serve topped with chives.
