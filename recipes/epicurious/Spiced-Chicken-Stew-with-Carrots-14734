Season chicken with salt and pepper. In a 5â€“to 6-quart slow cooker with a browning option, brown chicken in oil; transfer to a plate. (If your slow cooker doesn't have a browning option, just remove skin from the chicken.) Add carrots, garlic, cinnamon stick, and cumin to pot. Place chicken on top. Cover and cook on high until chicken is cooked through, 4 hours (or 8 hours on low), adding raisins 15 minutes before done. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chicken and carrots to a serving dish (remove cinnamon stick); top with cilantro and almonds. Season cooking liquid with salt and pepper. Spoon over chicken before serving.
