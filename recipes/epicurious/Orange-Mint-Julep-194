Bring zest, sugar, and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Let cool; cover and chill at least 2 hours. Strain syrup into a small jar or bowl. For each cocktail, muddle 1 piece of orange, a small handful mint sprigs, 1 ounce orange syrup, and a few dashes orange bitters in a double Old Fashioned glass or a julep cup. Add 2 ounces bourbon and stir to combine. Fill glass with crushed ice and garnish with more mint.
