Simmer cranberries, sugar, rosemary, and water in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have burst and are very soft and liquid is slightly syrupy, about 30 minutes. Pour syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, gently stirring cranberries but not pressing on them, then discard berries. Chill syrup, uncovered, until cold, at least 3 1/2 hours. Just before serving, stir together vodka and syrup in a pitcher. Serve over ice in 6- to 8-ounce glasses.
