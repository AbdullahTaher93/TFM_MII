Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions, anchovies, mushroom powder, if using, and 1 tablespoon garlic. Cook, stirring often, until onions are golden brown and softened, 40â€“45 minutes. If onions start to burn or stick, reduce heat and add water a splash at a time, scraping up browned bits. Let cool, then finely chop. Meanwhile, heat a dry medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high heat. Toss scallion whites with remaining 1 teaspoon oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, until charred, about 5 minutes. Let cool; finely chop. Thinly slice greens. Mix onion mixture, scallion whites and greens, mayonnaise, yogurt, sour cream, chives, Worcestershire, and remaining garlic in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Serve with chips.
