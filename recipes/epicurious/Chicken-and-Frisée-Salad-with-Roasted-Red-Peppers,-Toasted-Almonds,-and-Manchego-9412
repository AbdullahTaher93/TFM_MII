Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over low heat. Add almonds and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer almonds to paper towels; sprinkle with Pimentón de La Vera and season with salt. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.) Whisk shallot, vinegar, and oil in small bowl to blend. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Place frisée, red peppers, and chicken meat in large serving bowl. Add dressing; toss to coat. Sprinkle salad with almonds and cheese. **Test-kitchen tip:**A vegetable peeler is the perfect tool for shaving Manchego cheese.
