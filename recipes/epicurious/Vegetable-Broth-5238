In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, leek, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add the thyme, peppercorns, coriander, and 3 quarts water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and gently simmer for about an hour. Pass the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a container, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. The broth will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days; it can be frozen for up to 3 months.
