Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and place a rimmed baking sheet on each rack. In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring water for rice to a boil according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss bok choy with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt and set aside. In another medium bowl, combine red-pepper flakes, honey, soy sauce, remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss shrimp in mixture to coat. Carefully remove the hot baking sheets from the oven; spread the boy choy mixture on one sheet and place on the lower rack; spread the shrimp mixture on the other sheet and place on the upper rack. Roast, tossing halfway through, until shrimp is pink and starting to caramelize (about 8 minutes) and bok choy is softened and lightly browned in spots (13 to 15 minutes). While shrimp and bok choy are roasting, add rice and 1/2 teaspoon salt to boiling water. Cover and cook according to package directions. Once cooked, fluff rice with a fork and stir in kimchi. To serve, divide kimchi rice among four wide bowls. Remove shrimp from the oven and drizzle with 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil; toss to combine. Top rice with shrimp and bok choy. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and scallions, and serve with lime wedges.
