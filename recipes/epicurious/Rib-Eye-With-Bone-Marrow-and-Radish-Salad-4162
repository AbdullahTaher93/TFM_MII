Season steak with kosher salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours, or chill up to 12 hours. Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat vegetable oil in a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high. Cook steak until deep golden brown, 5–8 minutes per side. Add butter and spoon over steak a few times. Transfer skillet to oven and roast steak until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120°F for rare, 5–8 minutes. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest. Increase oven temperature to 425°F. Combine anchovies, capers, and olive oil in a small bowl; season with kosher salt and pepper. Spread half of anchovy mixture onto cut sides of marrow bone. Roast bone on a rimmed baking sheet until top is browned and marrow is tender, 10–12 minutes. Meanwhile, cut half of the radishes into quarters (leave the tops on, if using); trim and thinly slice remaining radishes crosswise. Toss radishes, celery leaves, parsley, lemon juice, and remaining anchovy mixture in a medium bowl. Season radish salad with kosher salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. Cut steak off bone and slice 1/2" thick. Transfer meat to a platter, pour pan juices over, and sprinkle with sea salt. Serve alongside marrow bone, radish salad, and toast.
