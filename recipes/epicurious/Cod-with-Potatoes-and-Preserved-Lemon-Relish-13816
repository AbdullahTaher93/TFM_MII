Bring onion, garlic, lemongrass, thyme, peppercorns, and milk to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer 20 minutes. Strain infused milk into a medium saucepan. Discard solids. Meanwhile, cook potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender, 25â€“30 minutes. Drain, then peel potatoes and coarsely mash in a large bowl with 1/4 cup oil; season with salt. Bring infused milk just to a boil. Add cod, reduce heat, and simmer until flesh begins to flake and is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove cod with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate. Combine preserved lemon, chives, lemon juice, paprika, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a small bowl; season relish with salt. Mix 1/4 cup infused milk into potatoes. Place cod over potatoes; spoon relish over. DO AHEAD: Relish can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
