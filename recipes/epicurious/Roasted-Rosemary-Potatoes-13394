Preheat oven to 400Â°. Bring vinegar, 1/4 cup salt, and 4 quarts water to a boil in a large pot. Add potatoes and cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes; drain. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and toss with garlic, rosemary, wine, and oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast potatoes, tossing occasionally, until completely tender and just beginning to brown, 35-45 minutes.
