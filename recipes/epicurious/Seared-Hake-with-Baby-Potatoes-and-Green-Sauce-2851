Juice each ingredient separately. Combine celery juice, sorrel juice, leek juice, and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and more vinegar, if desired. Place potatoes in a medium saucepan and add water to cover; season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until tender, 10â€“15 minutes; drain and return to saucepan. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil, then season with salt. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season fish with salt and cook, skin side down, until very crisp, about 4 minutes. Turn fish and cook until just cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet and add scallions. Cook, turning occasionally, until scallions are charred in spots and are slightly softened, about 1 minute. Transfer to plate with fish. Divide fish, yogurt, and potatoes among shallow bowls. Spoon green sauce around and drizzle with oil. Top with scallions and chervil.
