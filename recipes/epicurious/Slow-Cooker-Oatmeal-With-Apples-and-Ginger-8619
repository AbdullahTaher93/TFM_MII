Mix apple, ginger, steel-cut oats, rice, old-fashioned oats, raisins (if using), almonds (if using), flaxseeds (if using), cinnamon, and salt in a slow cooker. Cover with 12 cups water and stir to combine. Cook on low until porridge is thick and soft, 7â€“8 hours. Porridge can be made 1 week ahead; transfer to an airtight container and chill. To serve, scoop out desired amount and add a splash of water or milk. Heat in a pot over medium or microwave on high in a heatproof bowl until heated through and desired texture is reached, adding more liquid if needed.
