Heat oil in a large skillet over high. Cook chicken, squid, and garlic, stirring, until chicken is almost cooked through and garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add noodles and sugar. Cook, stirring, until noodles start to brown and chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Stir in seasoning sauce and cabbage and radish, if using. Push noodles to the edge of skillet and crack eggs into the center. Let eggs sizzle slightly, then break up yolks and whites with spatula. Cook until whites start to set. Toss noodles into eggs to coat and to form smaller pieces of egg. Cook, undisturbed, until underside is brown. Turn and add scallions and fish sauce. Season with pepper and toss. Arrange lettuce on a platter; top with noodle mixture. Serve with chili paste.
