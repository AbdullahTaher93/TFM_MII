In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat and then add pears, cranberries, sugar, cinnamon, orange zest, and juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit has softened and the liquid has reduced slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl to cool before serving, at least 15 minutes. To serve, scoop ice cream into bowls, top with cranberry-pear compote, and sprinkle with gingersnaps.
