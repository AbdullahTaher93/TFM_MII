Preheat oven to 350Â°. Spread out almonds on a small rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 8-10 minutes. Let cool. Whisk vinegar, mustard, poppy seeds, and sugar in a large bowl. Whisk in oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook peas in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until bright green and tender, about 5 minutes for fresh peas, or 2 minutes for frozen. Drain; transfer to a colander set in a bowl of ice water. Drain. Add arugula, strawberries, pea tendrils, peas, and almonds to vinaigrette; toss to coat. Top with Parmesan.
