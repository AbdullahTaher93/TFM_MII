Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly coat pan with nonstick spray. Bring molasses and stout to a simmer in a small saucepan, whisking to incorporate. Remove from heat and stir in baking soda; let cool. Sift rye flour, all-purpose flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pepper through a coarse-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Stir in baking powder and salt. Whisk eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, fresh ginger, and vanilla extract in a large bowl to combine. Whisk in coconut oil, vegetable oil, and cooled molasses mixture. Add dry ingredients and fold just until blended. Scrape batter into prepared pan. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 10 minutes. Run a knife around sides of cake and unmold. Let cool completely. Break cake into large pieces and arrange on a platter. Swirl honey into yogurt in a small bowl and serve alongside cake. Cake can be made 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
