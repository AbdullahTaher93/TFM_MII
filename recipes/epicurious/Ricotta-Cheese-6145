Have ready a colander lined with cheesecloth placed over a large bowl. Place the milk and salt in a large heavy-bottomed pot. Slowly bring the milk to 185Â°F. The milk will sizzle at the perimeter of the pot. Take the milk off the heat and stir in the vinegar. The curds will precipitate promptly. Allow them to form, a couple of minutes. Pour the milk and curds through the cheesecloth. Allow the curds to drain for an hour or so, then squeeze the curds in the cheesecloth and pack in a bowl. The ricotta holds for about 2 days in the refrigerator.
