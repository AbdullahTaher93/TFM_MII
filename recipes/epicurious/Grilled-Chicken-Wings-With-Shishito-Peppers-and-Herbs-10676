Season chicken wings with salt and black pepper, place in a large resealable plastic bag, and add 1 cup vinaigrette. Seal bag and turn to coat; chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Prepare a grill for medium heat. Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until wings are evenly charred and cooked through, 8–10 minutes if separated, 12–15 minutes if left whole. Transfer to a platter. Meanwhile, toss shishito peppers and oil in a medium bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until charred in spots and blistered, about 3 minutes. Transfer to platter with wings. Scatter jalapeño and herbs over wings and shishito peppers. Drizzle with remaining 1/4 cup vinaigrette.
