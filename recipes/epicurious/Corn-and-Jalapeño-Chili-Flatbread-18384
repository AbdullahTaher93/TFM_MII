Preheat a grill pan or grill over high heat. Place the creamed corn, haloumi, mozzarella, jalapeños, lime zest, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon the mixture into the pita halves and press to fill to the edges. Brush the pitas with the oil and grill for 2–3 minutes on each side or until lightly charred and the cheese has melted. Cut into wedges to serve.
