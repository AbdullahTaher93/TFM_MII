1. Arrange the cucumber, potato and pepper slices, and the pitted olives on a serving plate or in a dish. 2. Season with salt, if you like. (Olives tend to be very salty so you may not wish to add any extra salt.) 3. Sprinkle the garlic, onions, olive oil, vinegar, and lemon juice over the salad. Chill for at least 1 hour. Before serving, sprinkle with the chopped mint leaves and cilantro leaves.
