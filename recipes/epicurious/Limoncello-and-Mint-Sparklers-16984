Combine mint and limoncello in a bowl, then gently bruise mint with a pestle or wooden spoon (to release flavor). Chill, covered, 1 hour. Pour limoncello through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher, pressing firmly on mint and then discarding it. Just before serving, stir in lemon juice, sparkling water, and enough ice to fill pitcher.
