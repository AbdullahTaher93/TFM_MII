Preheat oven to 375°F. Unroll pie crust onto a piece of parchment, then roll out to a 13"-diameter circle. Transfer dough on parchment to a rimmed baking sheet. Toss pears, salt, and 1/2 cup caramel sauce in a medium bowl until pears are coated. Arrange pears over crust, leaving a 1 1/2" border, piling them up as you go. Pour any caramel sauce left in bowl over pears. Fold crust up and over edges, overlapping as needed. Bake galette until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 55–60 minutes. Whisk remaining 1 Tbsp. caramel and 1 Tbsp. hot water in a small bowl and brush over pears with a pastry brush. Let cool at least 15 minutes before cutting.
