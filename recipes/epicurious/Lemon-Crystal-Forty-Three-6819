In a bowl, stir together lemon juice, sugar, rind and 1 1/4 cups water until the sugar is dissolved.Pour the mixture into an ice tray and freeze into solid cubes. The lemon mixture may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance. In a blender, blend frozen lemon mixture, Cuarenta Y Tres, and vodka, scraping down the sides occasionally, until the mixture is smooth but still frozen. Divide the mixture between 2 stemmed glasses.
