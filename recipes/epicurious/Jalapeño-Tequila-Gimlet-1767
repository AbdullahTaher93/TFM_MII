Grill, broil, or roast jalape√±os over a gas flame, turning frequently, until soft and charred. Stem and chop chiles. Transfer chiles and seeds, if using, to a jar. Add tequila and let sit for 1 hour. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium pitcher; discard solids in sieve. Stir in lime juice, agave syrup, and 2 cups ice (to chill and dilute). Let stand, stirring occasionally, until ice is melted. Divide gimlet among chilled glasses.
