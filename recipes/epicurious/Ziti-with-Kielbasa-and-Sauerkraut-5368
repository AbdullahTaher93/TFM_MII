Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and red bell pepper and sauté until almost tender, about 7 minutes. Add sausage and sauté until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Mix in sauerkraut, mustard, caraway seeds and cayenne pepper. Sauté until heated through, about 4 minutes. Stir in wine and parsley. Cook mixture 2 minutes longer. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta and return to pot. Add sausage mixture to pasta and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
