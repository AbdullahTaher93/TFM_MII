In a large skillet melt the butter with the saffron over moderate heat, stirring, add the stock, and bring the liquid to a boil. Stir in the couscous, cover the skillet, and remove it from the heat. Let the mixture stand for 4 minutes and transfer it to a ceramic or glass bowl, breaking up any lumps with a fork. Add the celery, the currants, the scallions, the pine nuts, and the parsley and toss the mixture to combine it. In a small bowl whisk together the lemon juice and the cinnamon, add the oil in a slow stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Drizzle the dressing over the salad, toss the salad, and season it with salt and pepper. The salad may be made a day ahead and kept covered and chilled. Transfer the salad to a portable container.
