Combine garlic, rosemary, and 1/4 cup oil in a large bowl. Working one at a time, pound lamb chops between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to about 1/4" thick; trim any excess fat. Season with salt and pepper and add to marinade; turn to coat. Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Remove lamb chops from marinade and wipe off marinade. Grill lamb chops, turning often and moving around on grill as needed, until charred on both sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a platter. Drizzle tomatoes with oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill in a grill basket or large cast-iron skillet until lightly charred and blistered, about 4 minutes. Serve tomatoes alongside lamb.
