Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to boil over high heat. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Add the rabe to the boiling water and cook until bright green, about 2 minutes. Drain and submerge in bowl of ice water until cool, about 2 minutes. Drain and set aside. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, and anchovies, stirring and breaking up the anchovies with a wooden spoon. Cook until garlic is fragrant and light golden in color, 1 minute. Add the rabe to the pan with any residual water. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the mixture starts to wilt, about 2 minutes. Add the salt and pepper and cook until rabe is crisp tender, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasoning. Spoon onto plates or a platter and top with parmesan and pine nuts.
