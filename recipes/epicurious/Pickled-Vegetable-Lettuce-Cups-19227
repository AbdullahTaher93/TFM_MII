Combine apple cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, 1 Tbsp. kosher salt, and 1/2 cup water in a large bowl. Add fennel, shallot, beet, and radishes and let sit 10 minutes, then drain. Whisk buttermilk, yogurt, and lemon juice in a small bowl; season dressing with salt and pepper. Spoon some dressing onto lettuce leaves and top each with some drained pickled vegetables, cilantro, and mint. Serve with any remaining dressing alongside. Dressing can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
