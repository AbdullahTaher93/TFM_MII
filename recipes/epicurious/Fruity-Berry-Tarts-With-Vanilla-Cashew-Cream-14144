Grease four (5-inch) individual, loose-bottomed,
fluted or straight-sided tart tins and set aside on
a tray. Place the dates and pecans for the crust in a food
processor or mini blender and blitz until they start to
clump together. Divide this mixture equally among
the tins. Press the mixture onto the base and up the
sides of each one, making sure it is of even thickness.
Place in the fridge to set for 30 minutes while you get
on with the rest of the recipe. Place the soaked and drained cashews, the dates
and vanilla seeds in a food processor or mini blender
along with 1/2 cup of cold water. Blend until as
smooth as possible to give a creamy mixture. Once the tart bases have set and are feeling firm,
remove them from the fridge and divide the cashew
cream among them. Spread it out evenly with the
back of the spoon. Top with the berries and then
scatter over the mint or basil to serve.
