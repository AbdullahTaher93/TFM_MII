Arrange tofu slices in a single layer on a paper towel–lined plate and cover with a few more paper towels. Press down firmly on tofu with your hands to expel excess liquid. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron. Cook tofu, turning once, until browned, 7–10 minutes total. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Meanwhile, whisk chile, soy sauce, mirin, Sriracha, vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger in a medium bowl to combine. Crumble tofu into small pieces and add to bowl; toss to combine. Crumbles can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill.
