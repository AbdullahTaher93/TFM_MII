Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 450Â°F. Toss potatoes with oil, thyme, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a large bowl until coated. Arrange in an even layer, cut side down, on two rimmed baking sheets. Roast potatoes, rotating sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until crisp and golden brown on the bottom, about 25 minutes. Serve with Horseradish-Yogurt Sauce, if desired.
