Preheat oven to 425°:. Mix oregano, olive oil, 3 tablespoons pomegranate molasses, and 2 tablespoons fennel seeds in a small bowl; season oregano mixture with salt and pepper. Toss fennel, onion, remaining 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, and remaining 2 teaspoons pomegranate molasses in a large baking dish or roasting pan; season with salt and pepper. Distribute evenly across bottom of pan. Season lamb with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Cook 1 rack of lamb, fat side down, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Turn and cook until other side is just browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to dish with fennel mixture, placing fat side up, and rub with half of oregano mixture. Wipe out skillet and repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, second rack of lamb, and remaining oregano mixture. Roast lamb and vegetables until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of lamb registers 125°: for medium-rare, 25–30 minutes. Transfer lamb to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes before carving. Serve lamb over vegetables topped with pomegranate seeds.
