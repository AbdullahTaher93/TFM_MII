Process lemongrass, garlic, kaffir lime leaves, ginger, and 2 chiles in a food processor until a fine paste forms. Season beef with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook beef, turning occasionally, until browned, 10–15 minutes; transfer to a plate. Cook lemongrass paste in same pot, stirring often, until lemongrass is beginning to soften, 5–8 minutes. Add star anise, cinnamon, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, beef with any juices, and 10 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, skimming occasionallly, until beef is tender and liquid is slightly thickened, 2 1/2–3 hours. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F. Toast coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden around the edges, about 4 minutes; set aside. Add shallots and carrots to stew and cook, partially covered, until vegetables are soft and beef is falling apart, 35–45 minutes. Mix in scallions (they should wilt slightly). Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions. Divide noodles among bowls and ladle stew over; top with toasted coconut and more scallions. Serve with lime wedges. DO AHEAD: Stew (without noodles) can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
