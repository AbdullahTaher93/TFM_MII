Place the tomatoes, red wine vinegar, oil, salt and pepper in a large bowl and, using a fork, gently crush the tomatoes. Set aside to marinate for 10 minutes. While the tomato is marinating, cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water for 8â€“10 minutes or until al dente. Drain the pasta and place in a large bowl, add the pesto and toss to coat. Top with the tomato mixture, kale, caper berries, ricotta, salt and pepper to serve.
