Mix ancho chile powder, ground coffee, brown sugar, paprika, dried oregano, pepper, coriander, mustard, chile de árbol powder, ginger, and 1 Tbsp. salt in a small bowl. Season steaks with salt, then coat with 5 tsp. spice rub per steak (save any extra rub for your next steak). Place on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and chill uncovered 3–6 hours. Let steaks sit 1 hour to come to room temperature, which will help them cook quickly and more evenly. Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook steaks 2 minutes or so on each side to create a nice crust. Transfer skillet to oven; cook steaks until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 5 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes. Slice 1/2-inch thick.
