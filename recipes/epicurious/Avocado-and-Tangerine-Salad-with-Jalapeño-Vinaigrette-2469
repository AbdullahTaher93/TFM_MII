Simmer tangerine juice in a small saucepan until syrupy and reduced to about 2 tablespoons, 5-8 minutes. Let cool. Heat a small heavy skillet over mediumhigh heat. Cook jalape単o, turning occasionally, until blistered and charred all over, about 8 minutes. (Alternatively, roast jalape単o directly over gas flame, turning occasionally.) Let cool; remove stem, skin, and seeds, then finely chop. Whisk shallot, vinegar, reduced tangerine juice, and half of jalape単:o in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Whisk in vegetable oil, then olive oil. Add remaining jalape単o, if desired. Set vinaigrette aside. Toss avocados, tangerines, purslane, mint, and vinaigrette in a large bowl; top with feta. DO AHEAD: Vinaigrette can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill.
