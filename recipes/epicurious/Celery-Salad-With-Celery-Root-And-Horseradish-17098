Peel and halve celery root. Using a mandoline, thinly slice one half. Cut other half into matchstick-size pieces. Combine celery root, celery stalks, shallot, lemon zest, and horseradish in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and toss thoroughly to combine. Let vegetables sit for 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Whisk oil and lemon juice in a small bowl; season vinaigrette with salt and pepper. Drizzle vinaigrette over vegetables. Add celery leaves and parsley and toss salad to combine.
