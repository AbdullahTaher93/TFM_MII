Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, whip cream to stiff peaks in a large bowl. Arrange 10 cookies in a circle (8 around the edge and 2 in the middle) on a cake stand or large plate, breaking 1 center cookie to fit. Top with one-quarter of whipped cream, spreading gently almost to edge of cookies (youâ€™ll want to see them peeking out). Dollop one-quarter of marmalade over. Repeat with 30 cookies and remaining cream and marmalade to make 4 layers, ending with marmalade. Place remaining 2 cookies in a resealable plastic bag. Using the back of a spoon, rolling pin, or meat mallet, crush to fine crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs over top layer, then chill at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.
