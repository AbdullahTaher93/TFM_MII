Preheat oven to 450°. Toss potatoes with 1/4 cup oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing once, until golden brown and tender, 30-35 minutes. Let cool slightly, then lightly flatten. Meanwhile, whisk vinegar and mustard in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in remaining 1/4 cup oil until emulsified; season with salt and pepper. Add potatoes, jalapeño, and parsley and toss; season with salt and pepper.
