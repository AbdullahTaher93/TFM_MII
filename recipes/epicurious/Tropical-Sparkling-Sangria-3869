Reserve some of the lime and carambola slices for garnish. In a large pitcher stir together the white wine, the mango nectar, the mango, and the remaining lime and carambola slices. The sangría may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Just before serving, stir in the ginger ale, the champagne, and ice cubes and serve the sangría garnished with the reserved lime and carambola slices.
