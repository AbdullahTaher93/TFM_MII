Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat; generously oil grates. Lightly brush corn with oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss onion with oil in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Grill both, turning often, until tender and charred in spots, 10–15 minutes for corn and 4–5 minutes for onions. Let corn cool slightly. Cut kernels from cobs and transfer to a medium bowl. Brush cheese with oil, season with salt and pepper, and grill, turning once, until charred and warmed through, about 2 minutes per side. Warm tortillas in a microwave or on cooler area of grill until soft and pliable. Divide cheese among tortillas, then top with corn, onion, avocado, salsa, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges alongside.
