1. In a large bowl, combine the Canary and Charentais melons and watermelon. Sprinkle with the salt and toss to combine. 2. Add the fennel to the bowl. Drizzle the oil and vinegar over the melons and fennel and gently mix with your hands. Let the melon and fennel marinate in the dressing at room temperature for 10 minutes. 3. Add the arugula and marjoram to the bowl and toss until just combined. Season with salt. Transfer the salad to a large rimmed serving platter or shallow salad bowl. Pour any juice from the bowl over the top of the salad and dig in.
