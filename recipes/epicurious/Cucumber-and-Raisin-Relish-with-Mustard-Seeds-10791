Bring vinegar, brown sugar, salt, mustard powder, and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a medium pot over high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar and salt dissolve, about 5 minutes. Place cucumber, onion, raisins, and mustard seeds in a heatproof resealable container. Pour hot brining liquid over cucumber mixture; stir to combine. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and chill at least 2 hours before serving. Serve cool or at room temperature.
