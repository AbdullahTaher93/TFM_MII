Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly coat an 8-or 9-inch square baking dish with coconut oil spray and set aside (the smaller dish will yield slightly thicker brownies). In a small bowl, combine the flaxseed meal and hot water; set aside to coagulate. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, spirulina, and salt. Set the dry ingredients aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the avocado, water, coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Using an electric mixer, beat in the brown sugar to combine until the avocado is smooth. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and beat well to combine. In a small bowl, combine the baking soda and apple cider vinegar. When the mixture fizzes, use a spatula to stir into the brownie batter along with the coagulated flaxseeds. Gently fold in the chocolate chips. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish, and, using the spatula, smooth the surface. Bake until the sides of the brownies are dry and pulling away from the pan and the center resists light pressure, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 1 hour. Then cut into 16 squares.
