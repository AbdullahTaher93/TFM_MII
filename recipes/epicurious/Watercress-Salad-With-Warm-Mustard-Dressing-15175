Whisk egg, lemon juice, mustard, and sugar in a medium heatproof bowl set over a pot of barely simmering water; cook until mixture is foamy, thickened, and hot to the touch, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in pepper, coriander, 1 1/2 tsp. oil, and 1/4 tsp. salt. Meanwhile, heat remaining 1/2 tsp. oil in a small skillet over medium. Add pumpkin seeds, paprika, and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt and cook, stirring constantly, until seeds are golden and puffed, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool. Toss watercress with warm dressing in a large bowl. Top with pumpkin seeds before serving.
