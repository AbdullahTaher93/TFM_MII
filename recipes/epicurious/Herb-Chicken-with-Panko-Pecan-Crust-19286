Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish. In another shallow dish, stir together the panko, pecans, parsley, thyme, and pepper. Set the dishes and a large plate in a row, assembly-line fashion. Dip the chicken in the buttermilk, turning to coat and letting the excess drip off. Dip in the panko mixture, turning to coast and gently shaking off any excess. Using your fingertips, gently press the mixture so it adheres to the chicken. Transfer the chicken to the plate. Lightly spray the top side of the chicken with cooking spray. In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat the bottom. Cook the chicken with the sprayed side down for 4 minutes. Turn over. Cook for 2 to 4 minutes, or until it is no longer pink in the center and the crust is golden brown.
