Cook sprouts in a large pot of boiling salted water 10 seconds. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel with a slotted spoon; let cool. Cooking in separate batches, repeat with snow peas, carrots, and cabbage (do cabbage last and keep it separate while cooling so it doesn’t color the other vegetables). Pat dry if needed. Pulse chiles, garlic, ginger, brown sugar, and 1 tsp. salt in a food processor until very finely chopped. Transfer purée to a large bowl; add lime leaves, coconut, sprouts, peas, and carrots and toss to combine. Season with salt if needed. Toss in cabbage just before serving. Vegetables can be cooked and chile purée can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill separately.
