Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high. Add charcuterie, onion, cilantro stems, garlic, bay leaves, vegetables, coriander seeds, red pepper flakes, and shrimp shells (if using) and cook, stirring occasionally, until shells turn bright pink and vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add 5 cups cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes. Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing on solids; discard solids. Stock can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
