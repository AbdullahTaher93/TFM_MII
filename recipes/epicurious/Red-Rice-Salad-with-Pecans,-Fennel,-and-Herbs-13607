Cook rice according to package directions. Spread out on a rimmed baking sheet; let cool. Meanwhile, toss fennel and onion with 2 tablespoons lime juice in a large bowl and let sit, tossing occasionally, until lime juice is almost entirely absorbed, 10-15 minutes. Coarsely chop 1/3 cup pecans; finely chop remaining nuts. Cook in olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-low until golden brown, 5-10 minutes. Let cool. Add rice and pecans to fennel mixture along with remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice and toss to combine. Gently fold in cilantro; season with salt and pepper. Serve drizzled with pistachio oil, if desired. Do ahead: Rice salad (without cilantro) can be chilled up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.
