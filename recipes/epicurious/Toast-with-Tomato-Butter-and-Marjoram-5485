Dice 2 tomatoes (you should have about 1 cup). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add shallot and kosher salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add diced tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until juices release and liquid reduces, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Pur√©e butter and tomato mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth. Stir in marjoram. Slice remaining 2 tomatoes. Spread each toast with tomato-butter, top with a tomato slice, and season with sea salt and pepper. Tomato-butter can be made and chilled for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.
