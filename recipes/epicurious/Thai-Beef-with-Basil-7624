Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add garlic and 1 chile and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up with a spoon and pressing down firmly to help brown, until cooked through and nicely crisped in spots, 8â€“10 minutes. Add broth and 2 cups basil and cook, stirring, until basil is wilted, about 2 minutes. Toss carrots, scallions, 1 tablespoon lime juice, and remaining chile, 1 cup basil leaves, and 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl. Mix soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, and remaining 3 tablespoons lime juice in another small bowl until sugar dissolves. Top rice with beef and slaw and drizzle with soy dressing. Serve lime wedges alongside for squeezing over.
