Heat stock in a medium pot over low; keep warm. Meanwhile, sprinkle fish on both sides with kosher salt. Top skin side with fennel seeds, patting lightly to adhere. Heat coconut oil in a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low. Working in 2 batches, cook fish, skin side down, until skin is crisp, 6â€“8 minutes. Turn and cook on other side 30 seconds. Divide stock among shallow bowls. Add a fish fillet to each, placing skin side up, and top with cilantro, sprouts, coconut, and some sea salt. Drizzle with olive oil.
