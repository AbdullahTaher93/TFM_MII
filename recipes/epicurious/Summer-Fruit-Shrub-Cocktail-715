Bring 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Slice 1 1/2 pounds ripe fruit (such as peaches, strawberries, plums, or pineapple) into medium pieces. Reserve a few pieces for serving and add remaining to pan. Reduce heat; simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit 30 minutes. Strain syrup into a bowl; stir in 3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar. Cover and chill shrub. For each cocktail, shake 2 ounces shrub, 1 1/2 ounces spirit of choice, and 1/2 ounce lemon juice in an ice-filled cocktail shaker until frosty. Strain into an ice-filled Collins glass; top with some reserved fruit.
