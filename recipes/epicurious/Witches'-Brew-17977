Bring cinnamon sticks, cloves, ginger, water, and sugar to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep, uncovered, 1 hour. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids, then chill until cold. Combine all remaining ingredients, except ice, with syrup in a punch bowl. Add ice before serving.
