Place first 6 ingredients in large blender. Add ice. Cover and blend until smooth. Pour into two 14-ounce glasses. Garnish with grated lemon peel and nutmeg. Dip the rim of each glass in water, then press into a bowl of coarsely crushed toasted shredded coconut. To crush the coconut easily, rub it several times in the palm of your hand.
