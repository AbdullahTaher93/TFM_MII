Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Add pumpkin seeds and cumin and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 4â€“5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels, season with salt, and let cool. Whisk lemon juice, honey, pepper, and 3/4 tsp. salt in a medium bowl until honey dissolves. Slowly whisk in remaining 3 Tbsp. oil until emulsified. Toss carrots and radishes with dressing in a large bowl, then fold in herbs, chives, and half of the pumpkin seeds. Top salad with remaining pumpkin seeds. Taste and season with salt and pepper if necessary. Dressing can be made 5 days ahead. Chill in a resealable container.
