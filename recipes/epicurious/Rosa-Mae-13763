Combine gin and tea bag in a 2-cup measuring cup. Let steep for 5 minutes. Discard tea bag. Stir honey and 1 1/2 teaspoons water in a small bowl and add to tea-infused gin. Mix in lime juice and Licor 43. Fill 2 Collins glasses with ice cubes. Pour half of mixture into a cocktail shaker and fill with ice. Shake vigorously 20 times; strain into prepared glasses, dividing equally. Top each with a splash of soda water. Discard ice in shaker and repeat to make 2 more cocktails. Garnish each drink with a lime wedge and add a dash of bitters.
