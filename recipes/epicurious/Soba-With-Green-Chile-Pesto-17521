Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup soba cooking liquid. Meanwhile, whisk miso, lime juice, and oil in a large bowl. Chop halved chiles, garlic, and a pinch of salt together on a cutting board, then use the side of chefâ€™s knife to mash into a paste. Transfer to bowl with miso mixture and mix well. Add scallions, chopped basil, and cilantro and toss to combine; season pesto with salt. Add soba, watercress, and sliced chile to pesto and toss, adding reserved soba cooking liquid by the teaspoonfuls as needed, until nicely coated. Serve noodles topped with torn basil and sesame seeds.
