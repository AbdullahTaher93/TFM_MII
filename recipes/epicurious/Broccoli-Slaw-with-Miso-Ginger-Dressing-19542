Using the coarse grater disk on a food processor or the largest holes on a box grater, coarsely grate broccoli stems and carrots into a large bowl. Whisk miso paste, orange zest, orange juice, ginger, rice vinegar, and sesame oil in another large bowl until smooth. Add broccoli stems, broccoli heads, and carrot and toss to combine. Cover and chill until ready to serve. Toss with cilantro, mint, basil, and scallions, transfer to a serving dish, and top with coconut. Slaw can be made and chilled for up to 8 hours.
