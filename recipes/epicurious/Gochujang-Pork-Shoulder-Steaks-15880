Pur√©e garlic, ginger, sake, gochujang, mirin, and 1/4 cup oil in a blender. Set 1/4 cup marinade aside; chill. Transfer remaining marinade to a large dish. Add pork; turn to coat. Chill, turning occasionally, at least 2 hours. Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Remove pork from marinade and grill, basting with reserved marinade, turning occasionally, and moving pork to a cooler area if flare-up occurs, until cooked to desired doneness, 8-10 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer pork to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain. Do ahead: Pork can be marinated 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
