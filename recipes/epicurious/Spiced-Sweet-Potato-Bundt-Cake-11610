Preheat oven to 350Â°. Butter and flour pan. In a medium pot, cover sweet potatoes with water. Bring to a boil; cook until potatoes are soft, about 15 minutes. Drain. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, and salt in a bowl. Using a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat cooked sweet potatoes and eggs on medium speed until smooth. Add melted butter and beat until combined. Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture, and mix just until combined. Remove bowl from mixer and, with a wooden spoon, stir in chocolate chips. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick or skewer inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 40-50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to let cool completely in pan, about 1 hour. Loosen cake from pan using tip of a dinner knife, then invert a rack over pan and turn cake out onto rack to cool. Drizzle with chocolate sauce before serving.
