Preheat oven to 400°F. Place 4 beets on a large piece of foil and rub with 1 tablespoon oil; season with salt and pepper and close up foil around beets. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until tender, 30–40 minutes. Unwrap beets and let cool slightly. Peel and cut into 1/2" wedges. Meanwhile, whisk miso, vinegar, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Set dressing aside. Thinly slice remaining 2 raw beets on a mandoline. Arrange watercress and roasted and raw beets on a platter and drizzle with reserved dressing; top with sesame seeds. DO AHEAD: Beets can be roasted 2 days ahead. Cover separately and chill.
