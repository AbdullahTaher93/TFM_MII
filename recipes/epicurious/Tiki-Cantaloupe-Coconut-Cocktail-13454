Slice a thin piece of rind off both ends of cantaloupe; cut in half crosswise and remove seeds. Scoop out flesh; set aside cantaloupe halves. Transfer half of flesh to a blender; reserve remaining flesh for another use. Add coconut milk, tequila, Midori, lime juice, agave nectar, and 1/2 cup ice to blender and blend until smooth. Divide cocktail between reserved melon halves and add ice to fill. Garnish with mint sprigs and lime wheels and serve each with 2 straws.
