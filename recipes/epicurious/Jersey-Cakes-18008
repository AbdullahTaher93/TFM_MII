In a large frying pan or griddle over medium-high heat, cook bacon, pork roll, and sausage until bacon is crisp, sausage is browned, and pork roll is slightly crisp. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large bowl, combine eggs, buttermilk, and oil. In another bowl combine sugar, salt, flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Add dry ingredients to wet and mix by hand (not with an electric mixer). A few lumps are okay. Transfer to a pitcher or gravy boat. Heat a griddle (preferred) or nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Melt a little butter in the pan (unless using nonstick pan). While pan is heating, dice bacon, pork roll, and sausage into small pieces. When pan is hot, pour batter into 3-inch-diameter circles and immediately sprinkle each with some of the meat mixture. When bubbles begin to form (after about 2 to 3 minutes), flip pancakes with a spatula and cook for another 2 minutes or so, until golden brown. Serve topped with butter and syrup.
