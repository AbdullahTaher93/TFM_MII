Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl, whisk together the egg white, salt, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of paprika, and the cayenne. Add the almonds and toss to coat. Spread the almonds out evenly on the prepared baking sheet and roast until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through. Transfer to a plate to cool for about 30 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/8 teaspoon of cumin and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon of paprika. Sprinkle this mixture over the cooled nuts. Store in a sealed container for up to 2 weeks.
