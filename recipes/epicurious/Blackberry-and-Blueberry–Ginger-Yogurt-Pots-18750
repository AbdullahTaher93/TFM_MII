Put the berries in a wide, medium pan with the ground and fresh ginger and 2 teaspoons of water and place over a low heat. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the berries are soft and mushy. Remove from the heat and leave to cool completely before serving. Meanwhile, using a paper towel, rub a medium non-stick frying pan with the oil or spritz with a little spray oil and set it over a medium heat. Add the oats and cook for 4-5 minutes, tossing frequently, until just catching color. Remove from the heat and leave to cool completely before serving. Divide the yogurt, berries, and oats among four bowls and serve.
