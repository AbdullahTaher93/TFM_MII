In a large saucepan combine chocolate, grated, 4 cups light cream, brandy, the coffee, the sugar, and the vanilla. Bring the mixture to a simmer over low heat, stirring, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is hot and well combined. Fold in 1 the heavy cream, lightly whipped, and divide the mixture among ten 10-ounce heat-proof mugs, rinsed with boiling water.
