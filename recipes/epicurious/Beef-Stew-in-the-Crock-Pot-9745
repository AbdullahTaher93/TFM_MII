Place the cubed meat and flour and in Ziploc bag, seal and shake until the pieces are fully coated with flour. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium high heat and sear the pieces of meat for 4 minutes until all sides are nicely brown. Remove the meat from the pan and place in the crock pot. Add the red wine and stock to the sauté pan and bring to a boil for one minute, scraping off the bits of meat that have caramelized in the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the reduced liquid to the crock pot along with the remaining ingredients and combine. Cook on low for 6-8 hours.
