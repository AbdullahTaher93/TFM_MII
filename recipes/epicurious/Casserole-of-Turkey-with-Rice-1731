Sauté the onions in butter until just tender. Add the mushrooms, and sauté for 2 minutes or so. Combine in a casserole with the turkey, ham, stuffing, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add an additional tablespoon of fat and the curry powder to the skillet used for sautéing the onions and lightly sauté the rice. Add to the casserole and pour in the hot broth. Place in a preheated 375°F. oven to cook until rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Add more heated broth if necessary to finish cooking the rice.
