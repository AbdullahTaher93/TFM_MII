1. Slice the tofu into 1/2-inch-thick slabs and lay the slices on top of paper towels. Use more paper towels (you'll probably need three) and firmly pat the tofu in order to remove as much of the water as possible. Cut the tofu into 3/4-inch cubes. 2. In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, orange juice, sesame oil, and canola oil. Add the tofu cubes and toss gently. Cover and let the tofu marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, and up to 24 hours. 3. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Spray a large shallow baking dish with cooking spray. Place the tofu in a single layer in the baking dish. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
