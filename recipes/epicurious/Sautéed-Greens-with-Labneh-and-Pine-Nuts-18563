Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast nuts on a small rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Let cool. Combine shallots and vegetable oil in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until shallots are golden, 8–10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots to a paper towel– lined plate; season with salt. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add greens in batches, tossing to wilt slightly before adding more, about 2 minutes. Add lemon juice and toss; season with salt and pepper. Serve greens with a dollop of labneh; top with lemon zest, shallots, nuts, and olive oil.
