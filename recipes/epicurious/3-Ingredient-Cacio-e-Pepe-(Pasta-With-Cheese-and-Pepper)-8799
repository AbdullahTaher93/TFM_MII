Combine 2 1/2 cups cheese and 2 Tbsp. pepper in a large bowl; add oil and 3/4 cup cold water and mash with a fork to make a thick paste. Spread paste evenly in bowl. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Using tongs, transfer pasta to bowl with cheese mixture; reserve pasta cooking liquid in pot. Stir pasta vigorously to coat with sauce, adding pasta cooking liquid to thin if necessary, until sauce clings to pasta and is creamy but not watery. Divide pasta among plates and top with additional cheese and pepper. Serve immediately.
