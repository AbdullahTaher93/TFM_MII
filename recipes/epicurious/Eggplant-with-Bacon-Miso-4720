Preheat oven to 425Â°. Cook bacon in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in miso and mirin. Cut eggplants in half lengthwise. Using the tip of a paring knife, score cut sides in a crosshatch pattern. Brush cut sides with 2 tablespoons oil, dividing evenly, then spread scant 1 tablespoon bacon-miso mixture over each half. Place on an oiled rimmed baking sheet. Roast eggplant until tender and lightly browned, 20-25 minutes. Top with scallions.
