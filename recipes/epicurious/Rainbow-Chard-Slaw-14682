1. Combine chard, cabbage, carrot, and nuts in a large bowl. 2. In a small mixing bowl, combine oil, vinegar, Vegenaise, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, oregano, basil, pepper, salt, and sweetener. Whisk until mixture is blended well. 3. Toss with salad mix. 4. Allow salad to refrigerate for 30 minutes prior to serving, if possible, so flavors can marry. (This salad actually tastes better the following day, after the flavors marry and the chard has a chance to absorb some of the dressing.) 5. Top with hemp seeds and dried blueberries.
