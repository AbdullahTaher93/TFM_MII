Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium. Cook hazelnuts until butter foams, then browns, about 5 minutes. Add thyme sprigs and cook until crisp, about 30 seconds. Immediately transfer to a bowl; spoon out nuts and coarsely chop. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a large pot and pour in cold water to cover by 1". Season with salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until very tender, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Return water to a simmer; cook kohlrabies until tender, 12–14 minutes. Drain and add to bowl with potatoes. Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium until warm. Pass potatoes and kohlrabies through potato ricer or food mill into a large bowl (alternatively, you can also use a masher). Stir in brown butter and warm cream; season with salt. Top mash with hazelnuts and crumble fried thyme over.
