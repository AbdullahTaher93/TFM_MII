Light a grill and preheat for at least 10 minutes or preheat a grill pan. In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp but still slightly chewy, about 5 minutes. (You could do this in a cast-iron skillet right over the grill). In a medium bowl, whisk the buttermilk with the sour cream, vinegar and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Brush the cut sides of the iceberg wedges with oil and season with salt. Grill over moderately high heat until the edges are browned and grill marks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn to brown the other cut side, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the wedges to a platter and drizzle with half of the dressing. Sprinkle with the bacon and serve, passing the remaining dressing at the table.
