Place raisins in a small bowl; cover with hot water. Set aside. Mix cumin, paprika, 1 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. cayenne in another small bowl. Pat chicken dry and rub all over with spice mixture. Heat oil in a 5–7-qt. Dutch oven or large wide saucepan over medium-high. Add chorizo and cook, stirring frequently, until crisp, 5–8 minutes. Meanwhile, mix chickpeas, orange zest, remaining 3/4 tsp. salt, and a pinch of cayenne in a medium bowl. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chorizo to chickpea mixture; stir to combine. Drain all but 2 Tbsp. fat from pan, then return to medium-high heat. Cook chicken, skin side down, until well-browned, 12–14 minutes. Transfer to a plate skin side up. Add onion to pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Add wine and broth. Bring to a boil, nestle chicken skin side up into onions in pan. Lower heat to medium, cover, and cook until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, drain raisins and stir into chorizo mixture. Stir chorizo mixture and Sherry vinegar into chicken mixture. Cook, uncovered, until heated through, about 1 minute. Stir in 1/3 cup parsley, then divide among 4 plates. Top with remaining 1 Tbsp. parsley and serve.
