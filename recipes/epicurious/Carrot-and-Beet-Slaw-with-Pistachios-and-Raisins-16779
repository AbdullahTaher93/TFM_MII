Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Spread out pistachios on a small rimmed baking sheet; toast, stirring occasionally until golden brown, 6-8 minutes. Let cool; coarsely chop. Combine garlic, raisins, and vinegar in a large bowl; let sit 1 hour. Remove garlic from raisin mixture and discard. Add carrots, beets, pistachios, parsley, mint, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes; season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Add oil; toss gently.
