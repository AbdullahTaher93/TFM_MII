Combine the watermelon, syrup, mint, and vinegar in a blender or food processor, and pur√©e until smooth (though there still may be watermelon seeds and shards of mint floating around). Pour the mixture into a strainer set over a small bowl to remove the solid pieces. Gently lift and stir the mixture to help the liquid pass through, without forcing any solids through the strainer.
