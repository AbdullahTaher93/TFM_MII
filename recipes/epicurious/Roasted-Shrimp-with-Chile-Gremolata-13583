Preheat oven to 450°F. Heat chiles, garlic, bay leaves, and oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until just beginning to sizzle, about 2 minutes. Remove chile oil from heat. Toss shrimp and chile oil in a 3-quart baking dish; roast, turning halfway through, until shrimp are cooked through, 8–10 minutes. Mix chile, garlic, herbs, zest, and oil in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Squeeze lemon over shrimp; top with gremolata.
