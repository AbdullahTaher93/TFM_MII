Preheat oven to 325°F. Trim dark tops from green garlic and place in chicken cavity; loosely tie legs together with kitchen twine. Halve green garlic bulbs and pale-green parts. Place chicken in a 2-qt. baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Tuck green garlic, garlic cloves, and lemon wedges around (make sure everything fits snugly to keep garlic from getting too dark); pour oil over. Roast, turning garlic and lemon occasionally, until chicken is very tender and garlic is soft and deeply caramelized, 2 1/2–3 hours. Serve chicken with garlic and lemon alongside.
