Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan. Split open the vanilla bean with a small knife and scrape the contents into the pan; add the bean pod. Turn the heat on low and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let sit for at least 30 minutes. Strain, bottle, and store in the refrigerator for up to one month. Add the gin, Cappelletti, orange juice, lemon juice, and vanilla syrup to a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake until chilled. Strain over fresh ice, top with the Prosecco, and add the garnish.
