Pat the onions dry between layers of paper towels and in a deep kettle or deep fryer fry them in small batches in 1 1/2 inches of 375Â°F. oil, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are golden. Transfer the fried onions with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and sprinkle them with salt to taste. The fried onions keep, uncovered, for 2 days. Serve the fried onions as a topping for spinach, potato, or tossed green salad.
