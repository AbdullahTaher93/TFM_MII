Preheat oven to 400Â°F. In a small saucepan, warm the sage and honey over medium-low heat until fragrant and the honey just begins to bubble, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes. Discard sage and let honey cool to room temperature. Lightly brush one side of each bread slice with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place slices on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in oven until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Remove from baking sheet and let cool. Spread blue cheese on baguette slices and top with apples and walnuts. Drizzle toasts with sage honey.
