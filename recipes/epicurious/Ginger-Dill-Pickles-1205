Bring ginger, garlic, vinegar, sugar, salt, coriander seeds, and 2 cups water to a boil in a medium pot over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Place cucumbers and dill in a heatproof resealable container or jar (divide among several containers if necessary). Pour hot brining liquid over cucumbers and dill. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and chill at least 2 hours before serving.
