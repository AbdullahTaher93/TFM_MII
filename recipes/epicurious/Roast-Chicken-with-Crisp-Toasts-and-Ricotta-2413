Season chicken inside and out with kosher salt and chill, uncovered, 12–24 hours. Let chicken stand at room temperature 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450°. Pulse sage and sea salt in a food processor until finely ground. Add pine nuts and pulse until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a medium bowl and mix in ricotta, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Stuff chicken with ricotta mixture, then tie legs together with kitchen twine. Place chicken in a large ovenproof skillet or Dutch oven and rub all over with oil. Roast, basting every 10 minutes after the first 30 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh registers 165°, 45–55 minutes. Brush butter over chicken and roast 5 minutes longer. Let rest 5 minutes. Arrange bread slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet or a cutting board with a well. Place chicken on top of bread and pour pan drippings over (reserve skillet). Tent chicken with foil and let rest 15–25 minutes, allowing bread to soak up juices. Heat reserved skillet over medium heat, then add wine, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet. Bring wine to a boil, reduce heat, and whisk in cream, broth, and butter until incorporated. Simmer, whisking often, until sauce coats the back of a spoon, 8–10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in 1 tablespoons lemon juice, and season sauce with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, heat a medium cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Transfer soaked bread to pan and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Set toasts aside. Toss greens, 1 tablespoons oil, and remaining 1 tablespoons lemon juice in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Remove twine from chicken. Spoon stuffing onto reserved toasts and arrange on a platter. Cut chicken into quarters and place on top of bread. Pour sauce around; drizzle chicken with more oil and serve with greens.
