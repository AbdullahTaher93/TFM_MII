Bring grapefruit, kumquats, shallot, sugar, salt, and 1/4 cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally and lowering heat if needed, until citrus is soft and liquid is syrupy, 45–60 minutes. Stir in vinegar and let cool. Cover and chill. Toast coriander seeds in a small skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool, then finely grind in spice mill or mortar and pestle. Mix ground coriander, coffee, salt, brown sugar, cocoa powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil grate. Season steaks generously with rub (you’ll have some left over). Grill steaks, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and cooked to desired doneness, 8–10 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes, then slice against the grain. Serve with citrus chutney. Chutney can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.
Rub can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
