In a large bowl whisk together brown sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon and add plums, lemon juice, and butter. Toss mixture well and spoon into a shallow 3-quart baking dish. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. In a food processor pulse together granulated sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 cup almonds until almonds are ground fine. Add egg and pulse until blended. Spoon flour mixture over plum mixture, pulling some plum wedges up for presentation. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup almonds over cobbler. Bake cobbler in middle of oven 45 minutes or less, or until golden and bubbling, and cool on a rack. Serve cobbler warm or at room temperature.
