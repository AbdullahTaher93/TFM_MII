Combine currants and vinegar in a small bowl; let sit at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Cook rice in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, 45-50 minutes. Drain rice, return to pot, cover, and let sit 10 minutes. Spread out on a baking sheet; let dry out overnight in an unlit oven or on countertop. Fit a medium saucepan with thermometer and pour in vegetable oil to measure 2". Heat over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 350°. Working in 4 batches, cook rice until golden and puffed, about 1 minute. Using a fine-mesh sieve, transfer puffed rice to paper towels to drain; season with salt and let cool. Meanwhile, pulse cauliflower in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to large bowl. Working in batches, pulse kale in food processor until finely chopped (be careful not to turn into a purée), adding to cauliflower as you go. Add puffed rice, currants with soaking liquid, cucumber, scallion, olive oil, Aleppo pepper, and sumac, if using; toss to combine and season with salt, black pepper, and more vinegar, if desired. Do ahead: Rice can be fried 5 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature
