Boil the potatoes in salted water until soft, about 7 minutes. Drain. Heat a large sauté pan over high heat. Add the oil and onion to the pan and lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Add the curry powder, jalapeño, ginger and garlic. Cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add the spinach and cover the pan to wilt the spinach, about 3 minutes. Lower heat and stir in potatoes. Season with salt. In a small bowl, combine the yogurt, cucumber, cumin and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble, place one-fourth of the spinach mixture in each naan. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons/45 milliliters of the yogurt sauce. Wrap the naan around the spinach and enjoy!
