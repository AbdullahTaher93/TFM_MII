Place garlic in a mortar; season with salt and pound to a very fine paste. (Alternatively, place garlic on a cutting board, season with salt, and mash with the side of a chef's knife.) Transfer garlic paste to a small bowl and gradually whisk in oil. Very gradually whisk yogurt into garlic mixture until emulsified. (Add too fast and sauce will break. If it does break, gradually whisk in 1 teaspoon water just before serving.) Do ahead: Garlic sauce can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Toss chicken, garlic, parsley, cumin, paprika, and red pepper flakes in a medium bowl; season with salt. Cover and chill at least 2 hours. Prepare grill for medium-high heat and oil grate. Thread chicken onto skewers. Grill, turning occasionally, until cooked through, 8-12 minutes. Serve with garlic sauce, pita bread, labneh, tomatoes, and mint. Do ahead: Chicken can be marinated 12 hours ahead. Keep chilled.
