Wrap stacks of 8 tortillas in foil and chill in sealable plastic bags until ready to heat. Tortillas may be wrapped and chilled 6 hours ahead. Preheat oven to 350Â° F. As needed, heat foil packages in oven 12 to 15 minutes, or until hot. Unwrap packages and transfer tortillas to a cloth-lined basket and cover with cloth.
