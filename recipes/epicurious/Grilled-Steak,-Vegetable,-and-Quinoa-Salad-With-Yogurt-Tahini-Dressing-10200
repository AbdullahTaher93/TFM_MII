Whisk oil, vinegar, honey, and salt in a large bowl. Add quinoa, lentils, dill, and oregano and stir to combine. Set aside. Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, tahini, oil, salt, and 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl. Set aside. Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Brush fennel, tomatoes, and scallions with oil and season with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until tender and charred in spots, 10–15 minutes; let cool. If using Halloumi cheese, brush with oil and grill, turning occasionally, until charred and warmed through, about 2 minutes per side. Meanwhile, rub steak with cumin, remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, and remaining 1/2 tsp. pepper. Grill until medium-rare, 5–7 minutes per side for flank steak, about 2 minutes per side for skirt steak. Let rest, then thinly slice against the grain. Transfer quinoa salad to a large platter. Top with grilled vegetables and steak. Season with additional salt and pepper and top with fennel fronds. Serve immediately with yogurt dressing alongside. The yogurt dressing can be chilled for up to 3 days.
