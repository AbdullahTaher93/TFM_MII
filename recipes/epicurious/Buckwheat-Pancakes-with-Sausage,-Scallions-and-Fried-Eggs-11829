In a large bowl, combine flours, baking powder, and salt. In another medium bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, maple syrup, and melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and stir to combine. Stir in 1/2 cup scallions. Heat a large skillet or griddle to medium and brush it with reserved sausage fat or vegetable oil. Scoop 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon crumbled sausage onto the top of the pancake. Flip and cook until lightly browned on the bottom, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter, brushing pan with rendered fat or oil, as needed. Serve pancakes drizzled with maple syrup and topped with fried eggs and sliced scallions.
