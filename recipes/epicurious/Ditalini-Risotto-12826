Heat butter and 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over medium. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, 12–18 minutes. Add wine, bring to a boil, and cook until liquid is reduced by half, 8–10 minutes. Add ditalini and 2 cups stock and cook, stirring occasionally and adding remaining 4 cups stock 1 cup at a time as pasta absorbs liquid, until pasta is al dente and sauce loosens, 25–30 minutes. Add 1/2 cup Pecorino and cook until cheese is melted and mixture is creamy. If sauce becomes too thick, add more stock until it's slightly runny again. Season pasta with salt. Divide among shallow bowls and top with kale, mustard greens, and more Pecorino. Sprinkle with pepper and drizzle with oil.
