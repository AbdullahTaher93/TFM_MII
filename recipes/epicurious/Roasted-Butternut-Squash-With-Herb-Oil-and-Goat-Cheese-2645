Preheat oven to 425°F. Place squash on a rimmed baking sheet and roast, turning once, until tender, 35–45 minutes. Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, whisk garlic, oil, parsley, marjoram, and 1/2 tsp. vinegar in a small bowl to combine; season herb oil with salt and pepper. Halve squash lengthwise and scrape out seeds. Using a large metal spoon, scoop out large pieces of flesh and place in a large bowl; discard skin. Add remaining 1 tsp. vinegar and gently toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Transfer squash to a platter and drizzle with herb oil. Crumble goat cheese over. Herb oil can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
