Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium. Cook onion, garlic, lemongrass, ginger, jalapeño, and cilantro stems, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add wings and 10 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until turkey meat is tender, 45–60 minutes. Strain into a large saucepan; reserve wings. Add hon-dashi and soy sauce to broth, adding more to taste if needed. Cover and keep warm. Pick meat from wings and set aside. Broth can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill broth and meat separately. Cook bok choy in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Transfer to a colander with a slotted spoon. Return water to a gentle boil and carefully lower eggs into water; cook 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool. Peel and halve lengthwise. Return water to a boil and cook spaghetti, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, then toss with sesame oil in a large bowl. Divide spaghetti among bowls. Ladle in broth and add kimchi, bok choy, eggs, and reserved turkey meat. Top with mushrooms, sprouts, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
