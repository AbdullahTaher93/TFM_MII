Arrange racks in top and center of oven; preheat to 375°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Working in batches, roll dough between 2 pieces of parchment until 1/8" thick. Chill while rolling remaining dough. Using a 4 1/2" round circle cutter, bowl, or large glass and keeping remaining dough chilled while you work, cut out circles of dough and transfer to prepared baking sheets. Chill 10 minutes. Reroll scraps one time and continue to cut and chill until you have 25 circles. Whisk egg and milk in a small bowl. Brush circles with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake circles, rotating sheets halfway through, until golden brown, 12–14 minutes. Transfer pie circles to a platter. Serve with toppings of your choice.
