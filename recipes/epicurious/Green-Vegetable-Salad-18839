To make the green dressing, place all the ingredients in a jug and, using a hand-held stick blender, blend until smooth. Place the vegetables in a large bowl and toss to combine. Divide between serving plates and top with the ricotta salata. Drizzle with the dressing and top with the chervil and hazelnuts to serve.
