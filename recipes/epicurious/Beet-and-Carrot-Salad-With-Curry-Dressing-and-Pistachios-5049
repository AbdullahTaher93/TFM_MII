Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss pistachios and 1 tsp. oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Roast, tossing once, until pistachios are golden brown, 5–7 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop. Meanwhile, bring curry powder and remaining 1/2 cup oil to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling occasionally. Let cool. Blend garlic, vinegar, and mustard in a blender, then, with motor running, stream in curry oil. Blend until dressing is very smooth and thick; season with salt. Toss beets and half of dressing in a medium bowl; season with salt. Let sit until beets soften slightly, 8–10 minutes. Add carrots and remaining dressing and toss to combine; season with salt and lemon juice. Serve topped with pistachios. Curry dressing can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
