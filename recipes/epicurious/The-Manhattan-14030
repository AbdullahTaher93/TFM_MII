Fill a shaker with ice. Add a hearty shot of bourbon. Add a splash of sweet vermouth and dash of bitters. You can also add a few drops of maraschino cherry juice, whatever that stuff is. Shake and strain into a martini glass, and garnish with a maraschino cherry. If you're lazy, or alone, just drink it on the rocks.
