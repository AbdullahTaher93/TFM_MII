In a blender blend berries, orange juice, 1/2 cup sugar, and lime juice until smooth. Force purée through a fine sieve into a large measuring cup or bowl, pressing hard on solids. Chill purée, covered, until cold and stir in additional sugar.(Purée keeps, covered and chilled, 2 days.) Fill tall glasses with ice and add enough berry purée to fill each glass by three quarters. Top off drinks with seltzer water or club soda and stir well.
