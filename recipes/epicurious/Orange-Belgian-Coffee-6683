In a bowl, with an electric mixer beat the egg white with a pinch of salt until it holds soft peaks, add the sugar and 1/8 teaspoon of the cinnamon, beating, and beat the mixture until it just holds stiff peaks. In a chilled bowl with the electric mixer beat the cream with the vanilla until it just holds stiff peaks, fold the egg white mixture into the cream, and divide the mixture among four 8-ounce mugs. In a pitcher stir together the coffee, heated if necessary, and the liqueur, divide the mixture among the mugs, and sprinkle each drink with some of the additional cinnamon.
