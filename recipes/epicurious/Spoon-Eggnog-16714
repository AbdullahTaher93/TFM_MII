Beat 6 of the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Set aside. Beat the other 6 egg whites until stiff, gradually adding the confectioner's sugar. Set aside. Beat the egg yolks with an electric mixer until they are very thick and almost white. Continue beating and add the granulated sugar, the Cognac, and the brandy. Fold in the heavy cream and the first 6 egg whites (soft peaks). Add the second 6 egg whites (stiff) to the eggnog. Whip the heavy cream until it barely holds a shape and carefully blend it in with a rubber spatula. Let the eggnog rest in the refrigerator for 12 to 14 hours before serving.
