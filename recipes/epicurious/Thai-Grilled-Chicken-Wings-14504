Grind chiles in spice mill to a fine powder. Mix chile powder, fish sauce, lime juice, sesame seeds, and sugar in a medium bowl to dissolve sugar. Adjust with more sugar or lime juice if needed. Prepare grill for medium-high heat. Combine oyster and soy sauces, sugar, oil, and pepper in a large bowl. Add wings; toss to coat. Let sit 20–30 minutes (if allowed to marinate longer, they'll be too salty). Thread 2 flat pieces onto each skewer on a diagonal, spacing about 1/2" apart. Grill along with drumettes, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and cooked through, 6–8 minutes. Serve with dipping sauce.
