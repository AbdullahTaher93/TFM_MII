Cook potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 6â€“8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon; let cool. Meanwhile, return water to a boil and cook carrots until tender, about 3 minutes; let cool in a colander set in a bowl of ice water. Drain, pat dry, and transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with peas, cooking until bright green, about 30 seconds; add to bowl with carrots. Working in 2 batches, repeat (cook, cool, dry) with rock and medium shrimp, boiling until cooked through, about 1 minute for rock shrimp and 2 minutes for medium. Add rock shrimp to bowl with vegetables; place medium shrimp in another bowl. Add potatoes, eggs, pickles, onion, and chopped dill to vegetables; toss well. Mix in Parsley Mayo, adding more to coat if needed. Top with medium shrimp and dill sprigs just before serving.
