Place your chosen glasses or bowls in the freezer for half an hour. Soften the gelatine sheets in a bowl of cold water for 3â€“5 minutes. Place 2 tablespoons of water and the sugar in a saucepan over a medium-low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then remove from the heat. Remove the gelatine sheets from their soaking water and squeeze out any excess liquid. Transfer the softened gelatine to the hot syrup and stir until dissolved. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes, then pour the prosecco into the syrup. Remove the glasses or bowls from the freezer, pour in the jelly mixture and return to the freezer for half an hour. Take the glasses out of the freezer and place 8-10 raspberries in each jelly, pressing down slightly. Chill the jellies in the fridge for 2-3 hours until fully set.
