Preheat oven to 300Â°. Place seeds in a bowl and fill with water; swish seeds around; strain. Rinse and drain. Toss seeds with lime or lemon juice, cayenne, and 1/2 tsp sea salt. Spread on a parchment-lined baking sheet and toast in oven for 12 minutes. Stir and continue toasting for 10-12 minutes more, or until puffed and fragrant. Remove from oven; cool.
