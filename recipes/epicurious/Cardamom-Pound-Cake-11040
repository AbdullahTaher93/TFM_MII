Butter a 9x5x3" loaf pan; line bottom and long sides with a strip of parchment paper, leaving overhang. Butter parchment and dust pan with flour, tapping out any excess. Whisk baking powder, cardamom, salt, and 2 cups flour in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk milk and 1/2 cup crème fraîche in a small bowl; set aside. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat sugar and 3/4 cup butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping down sides and bottom of bowl with a spatula, then add vanilla and almond extracts. Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with crème fraîche mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; beat just until combined. Scrape batter into prepared pan, smooth top, and sprinkle with sliced almonds. Bake cake, rotating halfway through, until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 55-65 minutes. (Tent with foil if browning too quickly.) Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Using parchment overhang, gently remove cake from pan and transfer to rack; let cool. Slice cake and serve with Tea-Poached Plums and crème fraîche. DO AHEAD: Cake can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
