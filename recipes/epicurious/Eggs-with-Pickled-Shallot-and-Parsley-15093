Gently lower eggs into a medium pot of boiling water and cook 8 minutes. Transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water and let cool. Meanwhile, combine shallot and lemon juice in a small bowl; let sit 10 minutes. Drain shallots and toss in a small bowl with parsley; season with salt. Carefully peel eggs (they'll be a little wobbly in the center) and slice crosswise 1/2" thick. Arrange on a platter and top with parsley and shallot mixture.
