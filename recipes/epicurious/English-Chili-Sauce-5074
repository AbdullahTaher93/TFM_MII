Put peppers in an enamel saucepan. Add vinegar and cook, covered, over moderate heat for about 10 minutes or until they are very soft. In a blender, purée the peppers with the cooking liquid for 30 seconds, or force them through the fine disk of a food mill. Do not discard seeds, as the sauce should be very hot. In a heavy enamel saucepan combine the purée with sugar and pickling salt. Simmer mixture until it is thick but still liquid enough to pour. Pour the sauce into sterilized Mason-type jars and seal the jars with lids. Use the sauce sparingly for seasoning.
