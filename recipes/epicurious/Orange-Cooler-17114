In a stainless steel or enameled saucepan, combine orange rind, sugar and water. Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Simmer for 5 minutes. Let the syrup cool and strain into a large bowl. Stir in bourbon, orange juice and lemon juice. Chill until cold. Transfer to a punch bowl set in a hollowed-out block of ice. Stir in champagne. Garnish the punch with cherries and orange slices.
