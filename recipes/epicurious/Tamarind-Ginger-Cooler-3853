Break up tamarind with your fingers into a small heavy saucepan. Add 2 cups water and simmer, stirring occasionally and breaking up tamarind as it softens, 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 15 minutes. Strain through sieve into a bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. Whisk together ginger syrup, tamarind pur√©e, remaining 5 cups water, and kosher salt in a large pitcher. Chill until cold. Stir drink (it will separate as it stands), then pour into glasses filled two-thirds with ice. Top off with soda water.
