In a large skillet sauté the garlic in the oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until it is golden and discard it. To the skillet add the escarole, the olives, the raisins, and salt and pepper to taste and sauté the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Cook the mixture, covered, over moderately low heat for 4 minutes, or until the escarole is tender, stir in the pine nuts, and boil the mixture for 1 minute, or until the liquid is evaporated.
