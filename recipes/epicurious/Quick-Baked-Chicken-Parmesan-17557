Arrange racks in top and bottom of oven and place a rimmed baking sheet on bottom rack; preheat to 450°F. Beat eggs in a large shallow bowl. Using a fork or your fingertips, mix breadcrumbs, Parmesan, 3 Tbsp. oil, 3 tsp. oregano, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper in another large shallow bowl or plate. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dip in egg, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Dredge in breadcrumb mixture, shaking off excess, then pressing to adhere. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet. Carefully remove preheated baking sheet from oven and generously brush with oil. Transfer chicken to baking sheet and return to bottom rack. Roast 6 minutes, then carefully flip (use a spatula to scrape under cutlets) and sprinkle with mozzarella. Place baking sheet on top rack and continue to roast until juices run clear, mozzarella is melted, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of cutlet registers 165°F, about 4 minutes more. Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook onion, stirring, until softened, 3–4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add marinara sauce, red pepper flakes (if using), 1/4 cup basil, and remaining 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Cook, stirring, until sauce starts to bubble. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until chicken is ready, stirring occasionally, at least 5 minutes. Divide sauce among 4 plates. Top with chicken and torn basil.
