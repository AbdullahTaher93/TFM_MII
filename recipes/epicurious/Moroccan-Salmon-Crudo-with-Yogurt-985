Combine the finely chopped dill, finely chopped mint, lemon zest, three-quarters of the lemon juice, the ras el hanout, olive oil, and cucumber and mix to make a chunky vinaigrette. Smear a thin layer of yogurt down the center of a large plate. Layer the salmon thinly on top of the yogurt. Sprinkle the salmon with the remaining lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Drizzle the vinaigrette on top and garnish with the coarsely chopped dill and mint. Serve immediately.
