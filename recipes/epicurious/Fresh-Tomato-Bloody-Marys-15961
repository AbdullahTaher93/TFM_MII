Pur√©e tomatoes, celery, parsley, and 1 tablespoon sea salt in several batches in a food processor until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and chill at least 1 hour. Force through a food mill or medium-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids (you'll have about 10 cups juice). Add horseradish, Tabasco, and lemon juice. Mix remaining tablespoon sea salt and 1 teaspoon finely ground fresh pepper on a small plate. Moisten outside of rim of each glass with lemon wedge, then dip rim in salt and pepper. Fill each glass with ice and 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) vodka, then top with about 2/3 cup juice.
