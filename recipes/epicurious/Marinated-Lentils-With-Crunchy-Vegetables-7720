Cook onion, bay leaves, and lentils in a large saucepan of simmering salted water until lentils are tender but still firm, 15â€“20 minutes. Drain; discard onion and bay leaves and transfer lentils to a medium bowl. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium. Cook coriander seeds and cumin seeds, swirling skillet, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spice mixture and vinegar to lentils, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Just before serving, top lentils with radishes, scallions, herbs, and celery; season with salt and pepper. Lentils (without herbs and vegetables) can be marinated 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.
