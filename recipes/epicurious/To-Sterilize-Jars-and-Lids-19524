Wash jars thoroughly in hot suds and rinse in scalding water. Put jars and lids in a kettle and cover completely with hot water. Bring water to a boil, covered, and boil jars and lids 15 minutes from time that steam emerges from kettle. Turn off heat and let jars and lids stand in hot water. Just before they are filled, invert jars and lids onto kitchen towels to dry. (Jars should be filled and sealed while still hot.)
