Whisk 1/4 cup fresh orange juice, 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar, 2 1/2 teaspoons honey, 1 teaspoon finely grated peeled ginger, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Cut 3 large red plums into thin wedges and thinly slice 1/2 small fennel bulb. Add to dressing; toss to coat. Cover and chill 30 minutes to allow fennel to soften and flavors to get to know one another. Toss 1/2 teaspoon finely grated peeled ginger into fruit salad. Serve drizzled with olive oil and topped with toasted sesame seeds and fennel fronds.
