Process 1/2 cup cashews, 2 tablespoons grated Pecorino, and 3 tablespoons water in a food processor, thinning with more water as needed, until a smooth, creamy paste forms; season with salt and black pepper. Set cashew paste aside. Whisk anchovy, oil, lime juice, 1 teaspoon pink peppercorns, and 2 tablespoons grated Pecorino in a large bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Coarsely chop remaining 1/2 cup cashews. Add nuts and collard greens to large bowl and toss to coat, gently massaging dressing into leaves with your fingers to bruise and slightly wilt. Spread some reserved cashew paste onto each plate and top with salad and shaved Pecorino; sprinkle with more crushed pink peppercorns.
