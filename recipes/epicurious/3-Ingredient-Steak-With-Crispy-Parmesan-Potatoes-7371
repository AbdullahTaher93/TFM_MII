Place potatoes in a medium pot; add cold water to cover by 1". Season with salt, bring to a boil, and cook until potatoes are fork-tender, 12–15 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet; let cool slightly, then lightly crush with your palm. Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium-low and add half of the potatoes; season with 3/4 tsp. salt. Cook, turning once, until golden brown, 15–20 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a plate. Add 3 Tbsp. oil, 3/4 tsp. salt, and remaining potatoes to pan; cook, turning once, until golden brown, 15–20 minutes. Return all potatoes to pan, sprinkle with cheese, and cook, tossing to coat, until cheese begins to crisp, 1–2 more minutes. Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Season steak with salt and pepper and cook, turning occasionally, until deep brown and an instant-read thermometer registers 125°F for medium-rare, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer steak to a cutting board. Thinly slice steak against the grain and serve with potatoes alongside.
