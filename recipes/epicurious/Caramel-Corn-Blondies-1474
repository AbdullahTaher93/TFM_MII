Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9x13" baking pan and line with parchment paper, leaving a 1" overhang on both long sides. Whisk brown sugar and 1 cup butter in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, whisking between additions, until smooth. Whisk in vanilla and salt. Add flour and stir to combine. Gently fold in 1/2 cup peanuts. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top, pushing batter to edges. Sprinkle evenly with caramel corn and remaining 1/4 cup peanuts and press down gently. Bake blondies until golden brown and firm, 25–30 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack. Lift bar out of pan using parchment overhang and cut into 24 squares. Bars can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
