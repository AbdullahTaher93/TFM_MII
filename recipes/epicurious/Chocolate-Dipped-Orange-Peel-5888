Wash the oranges and remove the peel with a sharp vegetable peeler, avoiding any white pith. Put the orange peel in a saucepan with 4 cups water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil for 5 Minutes. Drain. Repeat this process one more time. Put 1 cup of the sugar and 1 2/3 cups water in a clean saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the blanched orange peel to the boiling syrup, immediately remove from the heat, cover the pan, and set aside overnight at room temperature. The next day, drain the peel, reserving the syrup. Add 1/3 cup of the remaining sugar to the reserved syrup, bring to a boil, and return the peel to the syrup. Remove from the heat, cover, and set aside overnight at room temperature. Repeat this process three more times, over three nights, adding 1/3 cup sugar each time. Once the peel is candied, let drain at room temperature for 1 day, then cut into thin slivers. (The peel can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 month.) Temper the dark chocolate . Using a fork, dip each strip of candied orange peel in the chocolate, then lay it on an acetate sheet. Refrigerate the chocolate-dipped strips for 10 Minutes before detaching from the sheet. (Store in a cool place away from moisture for up to 1 month.)
