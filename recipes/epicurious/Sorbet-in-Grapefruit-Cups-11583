Cut grapefruits in half and juice them (reserve juice for Daiquiri Ice Pops or drinking). Using a large spoon, scrape out pulp and flesh (it should come out easily). Peel away any residual white pith so you're left with completely clean rinds. Fill grapefruit halves with sorbet and smooth tops flush with edges of fruit using a small flexible spatula or butter knife to make cups; freeze until ready to serve. Cut each sorbet cup in half to make quarters just before serving. Sorbet cups can be made 1 day ahead. Cover once sorbet is solid and keep frozen.
