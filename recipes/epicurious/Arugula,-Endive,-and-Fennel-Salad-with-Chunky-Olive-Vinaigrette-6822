Whisk together lemon zest and juice, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a small bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Stir in olives. Halve fennel lengthwise and remove core, then thinly slice crosswise using slicer. Just before serving, toss fennel, arugula, and endives with just enough vinaigrette to coat and salt and pepper to taste.
