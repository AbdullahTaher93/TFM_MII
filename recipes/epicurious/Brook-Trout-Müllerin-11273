Season both sides of the filets with salt and pepper and lightly dust with flour. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the filets, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is brown and crispy, 3â€“5 minutes. Carefully turn with a spatula and cook for another 30 seconds. Squeeze the lemon over the fish and add the parsley. As the sauce begins to bubble up, spoon ample butter over each filet and serve immediately.
