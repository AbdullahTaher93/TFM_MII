To make the rub: In a small bowl, combine the paprika, rosemary, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. To make the beef: Pat the chuck roast dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Evenly pat the rub on all sides of the roast. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. Add the seasoned roast and sear on each side for 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the roast to a slow cooker. Place the carrots, onion, celery, and potatoes around the roast. In a small bowl, whisk together the beef broth, vinegar, and garlic. Add the beef broth mixture and the bay leaves to the slow cooker. Cover and cook for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low. Remove the bay leaves before serving.
