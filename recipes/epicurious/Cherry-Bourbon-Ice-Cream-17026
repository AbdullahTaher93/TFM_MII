Cook 1 1/2 cups halved pitted cherries, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 tablespoon water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until syrupy, 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon bourbon; let cool. Process custard and fold in cherry mixture just before transferring to freezer.
