Press lightly onto bottom and halfway up sides of ungreased 13 x 9-inch baking pan. Bake for 20 minutes. Beat sweetened condensed milk and eggs in a large mixing bowl until fluffy. Beat in lemon juice, flour, baking powder, salt, and food coloring until blended. Fold in grated lemon peel; pour over crust. Bake until filling is set and crust is golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan on wire rack. Refrigerate for 2 hours. Cut into bars; sprinkle with powdered sugar.
