Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Add capers and fry, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer capers to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and season with salt. Fry basil in batches in same skillet until crisp, about 30 seconds. Transfer to paper-towel lined plate and season with salt. Let oil in pan cool slightly. Toss cucumber, tomatoes, onion, vinegar, fried capers, and 1/4 cup warm caper-basil oil in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Vigorously rub one side of hot toasts with garlic, then top with tomato mixture. Top with fried basil leaves and serve warm.
