Pour the water into a large pot. Add the cinnamon and ginger and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and carefully remove the cinnamon and ginger. Add the brown sugar and stir until completely dissolved. Let cool, then refrigerate for several hours (preferably overnight) until chilled. If you wish, sprinkle a few pine nuts in each cup before serving.
