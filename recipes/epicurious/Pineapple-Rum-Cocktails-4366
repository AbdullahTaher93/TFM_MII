Blend one fourth of pineapple juice with all of mint and sugar in a blender until mint is finely chopped, then pour into a pitcher with lime juice and remaining pineapple juice. Chill until ready to use. Just before serving, fill tall glasses halfway with ice and add 3 tablespoons rum to each, then top with 1/2 cup juice.
