Combine yogurt, lemon juice, and garlic in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Transfer 1/2 cup yogurt mixture to a small bowl and set aside for serving. Stir cumin, coriander, turmeric, and allspice into remaining yogurt mixture. Season lamb chops with salt and pepper. Using your hands, evenly coat all sides of chops with spiced yogurt mixture (avoiding the bone if they are frenched). Let chops sit at room temperature 30 minutes, or cover and chill up to 12 hours. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Wipe off excess marinade from lamb chops and cook half until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side (the yogurt in the marinade will help them take on color quickly). Remove chops from skillet and pour off fat (no need to wipe it out). Repeat with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and remaining chops. Serve lamb chops with reserved yogurt mixture alongside.
