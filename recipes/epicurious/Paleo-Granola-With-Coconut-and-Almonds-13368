Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss coconut, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, if using, salt, cinnamon, and cardamom in a large bowl. Cook honey, oil, and vanilla in a small pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until hot and easily pourable, about 1 minute. Pour over coconut mixture and stir to combine. Spread mixture evenly on prepared baking sheet and bake, stirring once halfway through, until golden-brown and crisp, about 25 minutes. Granola can be made 1 week ahead; store tightly covered at room temperature.
