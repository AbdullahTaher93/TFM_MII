Season steak with salt and pepper. Place steak in a large resealable bag or bowl. Pour chermoula over, toss to coat, then let rest at room temperature at least 1 hour. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat or heat grill pan over medium-high; lightly oil grate or pan. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Grill steak until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 125°F, 2–3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain. Toss carrots, cucumbers, arugula, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup herbs, and 1/4 cup chermoula sauce in a large bowl. Divide salad among 4 plates. Top with steak and remaining 1/2 cup herbs. Drizzle salads with remaining 1/4 cup chermoula sauce. Top with feta and pomegranate seeds. Steak can be marinated 10 hours ahead; chill in bag. Let steak come to room temperature at least 1 hour before cooking.
