Preheat oven to 350°F. Cook barley in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender, 15–20 minutes for pearl, 35–40 for hulled or hull-less. Drain and spread out on a rimmed baking sheet; let cool. Meanwhile, toss breadcrumbs with 1 tablespoon oil on another rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Bake, tossing once, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes; let cool. Bring milk to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; season with salt. Add cauliflower and cook until just softened, about 3 minutes; drain well. Discard milk. Toss cauliflower, barley, breadcrumbs, shallot, celery hearts, celery leaves, parsley, parsley stems, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vinegar in a bowl; season salad with salt. Mix burrata and crème fraîche in a medium bowl; season with salt. Divide burrata mixture among plates, drizzle with oil, and top with barley salad; season with pepper. DO AHEAD: Barley can be cooked 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Breadcrumbs can be toasted 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature.
