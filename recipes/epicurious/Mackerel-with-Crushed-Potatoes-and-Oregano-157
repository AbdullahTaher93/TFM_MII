Place potatoes in a large pot, add water to cover, and season with kosher salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until tender, 10–12 minutes. Drain; let cool slightly. Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, and vinegar in a small bowl; season with kosher salt and pepper. Set yogurt sauce aside. Place potatoes on a broiler-proof rimmed baking sheet and, using the bottom of a small bowl or measuring cup, press potatoes to flatten slightly. Add garlic, drizzle with 4 tablespoons oil, and toss to coat; season with kosher salt and pepper. Broil potatoes until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Rub skin side of mackerel with remaining 1 tablespoon oil; season with kosher salt and pepper. Place, skin side up, on top of potatoes and broil until fish is opaque throughout and skin is crisp, 10–12 minutes. Remove from oven and top with oregano and lemon zest. Spoon yogurt sauce onto each plate and top with potatoes and fish; sprinkle with sea salt.
