Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 9-inch pie plate. Whisk eggs, granulated sugar, almond extract, and salt in a large bowl until frothy and pale, about 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour and stir until incorporated. Pour into prepared pie plate. Top with almonds and pearl sugar, if using. Bake cake until top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20–25 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool slightly before serving. Cake can be made 1 day ahead; store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
