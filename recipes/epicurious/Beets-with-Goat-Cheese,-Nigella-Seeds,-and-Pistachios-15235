Toast pistachios in a dry small skillet over medium-high heat, stirring often, until golden brown, about 5 minutes; let cool. Combine 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and a pinch of kosher salt in a large saucepan and add water so mixture comes 1" up sides of pan. Fit with a steamer basket and bring liquid to a simmer over medium. Add beets, cover pan, and steam until tender, 30-40 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly. While beets are still warm, add 2 ounces goat cheese, remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon paprika; season with kosher salt and pepper. Coarsely smash beets with a fork or potato masher, leaving some bigger pieces. Serve topped with nigella seeds, pistachios, sea salt, and remaining goat cheese and drizzled with oil.
