In a large saucepan over high heat, bring 3 quarts water and 1/2 cup kosher salt to a boil. Prepare an ice bath of 3 quarts water and ice with 1/2 cup kosher salt stirred in until dissolved. Add the shelled English peas to the boiling water and cook until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. When sweet and tender, immediately remove the peas from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice bath to stop the cooking. Let sit until the peas are fully cooled, 1 to 2 minutes, then drain. Combine blanched peas, green garlic, mint, chervil, lemon, olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the pepper in a food processor and puree until smooth. Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed. Serve with crudit√©s or Crackers.
