Heat 1/2 cup oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, fry prosciutto until lightly browned and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Cook butter in a small skillet over medium heat until butter foams, then browns (be careful not to let it burn), about 5 minutes. Allow browned milk solids to settle, then slowly pour off melted butter, leaving browned bits in the pan. (Reserve butter for another use.) Whisk vinegar, honey, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil into browned milk solids; season dressing with salt and pepper. Toss chicories, apple, and dressing in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Serve salad topped with fried prosciutto.
