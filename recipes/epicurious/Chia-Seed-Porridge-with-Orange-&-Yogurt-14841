Put the chia seeds, blood orange juice and agave syrup into a bowl and mix together. Put the bowl in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or until the chia seeds have absorbed all the liquid. Using a sharp knife, segment the oranges by cutting away the pith and membrane so that only the flesh remains. Divide the chia mixture between 2 bowls, add the blood orange segments and top each portion with half the yogurt. Serve immediately.
