Heat 1/4 cup peanut or vegetable oil in a small saucepan over low and cook 8 thinly sliced garlic cloves, stirring occasionally, until translucent and soft, 8–10 minutes; let cool. Transfer garlic to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon; save oil for another use. Add 2 thinly sliced jalapeños, 2 thinly sliced scallions (green parts only), 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, 1/2 cup chopped salted, roasted peanuts, and 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice and toss to combine. Gently toss in Crispy Salt-and-Pepper Chicken Skin. Serve with lime wedges.
