In each of four 8-ounce mugs, combine 2 tablespoons of the crème de cacao and 1 tablespoon of the crème de menthe, divide the coffee, heated if necessary, among the mugs, and stir the drinks until they are combined well. Top each drink with a dollop of the whipped cream and sprinkle the whipped cream with the chocolate.
