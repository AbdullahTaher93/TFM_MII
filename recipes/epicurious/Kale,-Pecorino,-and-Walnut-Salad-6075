Tear any large pieces of kale into bite sized pieces. In a serving bowl, drizzle the kale with the oil, squeeze in the lemon juice, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss until well mixed and taste for seasoning. Use a vegetable peeler to shave thin pieces of Pecorino over the top. Finish by topping with walnuts.
