Combine oil and vinegar in a small airtight container; cover, and shake well. Season with salt and pepper. Vinaigrette can be made 3 days ahead; chill. Combine rice and 1 3/4 cups water in a medium saucepan; season with salt. Bring to a boil on camp stove over high. Reduce heat, cover saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 45â€“50 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff rice, and let sit, covered, 10 minutes. Let cool. Just before serving, toss rice and radishes with dressing in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add ricotta salata, almonds, dill, and chives and toss.
