Bring hibiscus, sugar, and 8 cups water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer 10 minutes. If using hibiscus flowers, strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; discard solids. If using tea bags, discard bags, then transfer mixture to a large bowl. Chill until cold, at least 2 hours. Transfer to a pitcher, pouring slowly so any fine particles remain in bowl. Stir in lemon juice. Aqua fresca can be stored in an airtight container and chilled for up to 5 days.
