Heat 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium-low heat (coconut oil has a very low smoking point, so be careful not to let it get too hot). Add ginger and chile and cook, stirring, until ginger begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Dissolve tamarind concentrate in 1/2 cup hot water. Heat remaining tablespoon coconut oil in a small heavy skillet over medium heat, then cook mustard seeds until they begin to pop and/or turn gray. Add red pepper flakes and curry leaves (if using), covering skillet immediately, and stir until curry leaves are crisp. Add spice mixture to ginger mixture along with cayenne, asafetida, and salt and cook over medium heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add tamarind liquid and jaggery and simmer, stirring, until mixture becomes somewhat thick and syrupy, about 2 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
