Cut 1 bunch scallions into 1" pieces; thinly slice remaining bunch of scallions and set aside. Bring 12 cups water to a brisk simmer in a large stockpot and add scallions, kombu, ginger, star anise, Sichuan peppercorns, 1/4 cup soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon salt; cook until kombu is softened, 10–15 minutes. Add chicken to pot and reduce heat so liquid is at a very gentle simmer. Poach chicken, uncovered, until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 160°F, 40–45 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and let cool. Meanwhile, increase heat to mediumhigh and bring poaching liquid to a boil; cook until reduced by half, 30–45 minutes. Fish out scallions, ginger, and star anise from pot with a slotted spoon and discard. Add noodles to poaching liquid and cook according to package instructions. Drain and toss in a large bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Combine kale, sugar, a pinch of salt, and remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a medium bowl and massage kale, rubbing between your fingers, until softened and shiny, about 30 seconds. Add vinegar, rice noodles, reserved sliced scallions, 1 tablespoon furikake, and remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce and toss to combine; season with salt. Remove skin and bones from chicken; discard. Slice or shred meat. Serve with noodles, drizzled with chili oil and sprinkled with more furikake. Chicken can be poached 1 day ahead; let cool, cover and chill chicken and liquid separately. Bring to room temperature before slicing. Noodle mixture can be made 3 hours ahead; store at room temperature. Moisten with more soy sauce and vinegar before serving.
