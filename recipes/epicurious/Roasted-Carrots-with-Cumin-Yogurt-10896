Roast, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and soft, 30–35 minutes; remove bay leaves. Meanwhile, toast coriander in a small dry skillet over medium-high heat, tossing, until fragrant, about 1 minute; transfer to a plate. Repeat with cumin. Let cool; coarsely chop. Purée coriander, cumin, yogurt, lime juice, 1/4 cup cilantro, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a food processor until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Serve carrots topped with cumin yogurt, cilantro, and sesame seeds.
