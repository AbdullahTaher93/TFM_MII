Combine sugar, lime juice, chopped mint and ginger in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves and syrup comes to simmer. Simmer syrup 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely. Strain syrup into small bowl, pressing lightly on solids; discard solids. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Pour 3 tablespoons syrup, then 3/4 cup sparkling water into each of 6 tall glasses. Stir to blend. Mix in additional syrup or sparkling water to taste. Top each with 1 scoop vanilla ice cream. Garnish sodas with lime slices and mint sprigs, if desired, and serve.
