Bring beans, onion, fennel, carrot, garlic, thyme sprigs, chiles de árbol, 1/3 cup oil, and 8 cups water to a simmer in a large pot over medium. Reduce heat to bring liquid to a gentle simmer and cook until beans are creamy all the way through, 50–65 minutes. Season generously with salt. Serve beans topped with pepper and a drizzle of oil. Beans can be cooked 3 days ahead. Let cool in cooking liquid; cover and chill.
