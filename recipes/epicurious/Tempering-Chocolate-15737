Place two-thirds of the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the base of the bowl does not touch the water (this setup is called a "double boiler"). Allow the chocolate to melt, stirring occasionally, until it reaches its correct melting temperature (see below). Remove the bowl from the heat, add the remaining chocolate, and combine with a spatula. As the chocolate melts, allow the temperature of the mixture to fall to the cooling temperature. Reheat the chocolate to the "using temperature" (see below) over the saucepan of simmering water. To check the temper of the chocolate, dip the point of a knife into it¿the chocolate should set quickly and evenly at room temperature. When working with tempered chocolate, make sure you keep it at "using temperature" or the chocolate will lose its temper. Melting temperature: 120°F
