Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil grate. Place potatoes in a large saucepan and pour in cold water to cover by 1". Season with salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer until tender, 15–18 minutes. Drain and return to saucepan. Meanwhile, grill shallots, turning occasionally, until skins are blackened and flesh is tender, 15–20 minutes. Let cool. Halve lengthwise and scoop out insides (discard skins). Whisk lemon juice, vinegar, and 3 tablespoons oil in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Add cornichons, capers, and potatoes and toss to coat. Toss kale and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium bowl; season with salt. Grill, tossing often, until charred and crisptender, about 1 minute. Fold into salad along with scallions, parsley, and shallots. Potato salad can be made 1 hour ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature.
