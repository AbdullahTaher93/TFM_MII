Combine cucumber, scallions, lime juice, and ginger in a medium bowl. Season to taste with kosher salt and set aside. Heat a grill pan or a lightly oiled cast-iron skillet over high heat. Season steak with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon chili powder. Grill steak, turning once, until charred on both sides, about 8 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Arrange lettuce leaves on a large platter. Thinly slice steak against the grain, then cut slices crosswise into 1" pieces. Add steak to cucumber mixture and toss to mix. Season to taste with salt and more lime juice, if desired. Divide steak salad among lettuce cups; garnish with peanuts and mint leaves. Drizzle with Asian sweet chili sauce.
