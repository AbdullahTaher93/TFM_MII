Bring sugar, 1 pound apricots, 3/4 cup sparkling wine, and 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until apricots are very tender, 10-15 minutes. Let cool completely. Transfer apricot mixture to a blender and pur√©e until smooth. Add water to apricot mixture so it measures 4 cups. Transfer mixture to a large shallow baking dish. Freeze until solid, at least 4 hours. To serve, scoop sorbet into coupe glasses or bowls and top with more apricot slices and some sparkling wine.
