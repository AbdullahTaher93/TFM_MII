Make pudding as directed on package. Heat oven to 350Â°. Line a 13" x 17" baking pan with parchment paper; coat with cooking spray. In a bowl, combine 3/4 cup sugar, flour and salt. In another bowl, beat egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy. Add cream of tartar; beat until soft peaks form. Slowly add remaining 3/4 cup sugar, beating until mixture is thick and shiny. Fold flour mixture into egg mixture in four batches; spread batter in pan. Bake until golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Loosen sides of cake with a knife; let cool. In a bowl, microwave jam for 30 seconds. Invert cake on cutting board; spread with jam and cut into 2-inch squares. In a nonstick pan over medium-high heat, toast coconut, stirring, 4 minutes. In another bowl, beat cream and coconut extract with an electric mixer until peaks form. Reserve 1/4 cup whipped cream. Fold pudding and 1/4 cup coconut into remaining whipped cream. In a large glass bowl, assemble trifle: Layer 1/3 cake squares, 1/3 fruit and 1/3 pudding mixture; repeat twice. Top with remaining 1/4 cup whipped cream and 1/4 cup coconut.
