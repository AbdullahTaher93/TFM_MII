Pulse 2 beaten large eggs, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a food processor to combine. Add 2 cups fresh corn kernels, 1 thinly sliced scallion, and 1/2 finely chopped seeded jalapeño; pulse 2–3 times. Working in batches, cook heaping tablespoonfuls of batter until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side; season fritters with salt. Serve with sour cream and lime wedges.
