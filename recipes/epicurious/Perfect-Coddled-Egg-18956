Set coddler inside a medium saucepan and fill with water to come three-quarters up the side of the coddler. Remove coddler and bring water to a gentle boil over medium heat. Meanwhile, butter coddler. Pour in half of cream and add half of ham and chives; season with salt and pepper. Add egg, then top with remaining cream, ham, and chives. Season with salt and pepper and seal closed. Place coddler in water and cook egg until whites are set but yolk is still runny, about 8 minutes. Serve with toast.
