Soak chiles in a bowl of very hot water until softened, 20-25 minutes. Drain and transfer to a blender. Meanwhile, cook tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high, turning often, until softened and charred in spots, 5-8 minutes. Set onion and garlic aside; transfer tomatoes to blender. Once cool enough to handle, peel onion and garlic and place in blender along with oil, vinegar, and sugar. Blend until smooth. Season with salt. Do ahead: Salsa can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill.
