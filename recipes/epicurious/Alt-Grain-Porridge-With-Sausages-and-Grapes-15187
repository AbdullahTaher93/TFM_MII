Pulse spelt in a blender or food processor until coarsely chopped (all of the grains should be broken open but not ground to a powder). Combine spelt and 4 cups water in a large saucepan over medium-high; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, whisking occasionally, until spelt is tender and mixture is thick, 25–35 minutes. Whisk in Parmesan and butter. Add water by tablespoonfuls if needed to loosen. While porridge is simmering, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook sausages, turning occasionally, until browned all over and partially cooked but still pink in the center, 6–8 minutes. Add grapes to skillet and cook, tossing and crushing some with a wooden spoon, until browned and slightly saucy, and sausages are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausages to a plate. Add wine and vinegar to skillet and cook until juices are thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add thyme and butter, swirling pan to incorporate butter into sauce; season with salt and pepper. Divide grain porridge among bowls. Divide sausages, grapes, and sauce over top.
