Pulse apple, garlic, marmalade, brown sugar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, sake, gochugaru, and pepper in a food processor or blender until garlic and apple are finely chopped. Transfer to a large dish and mix in soy sauce. Add ribs and turn to coat. Let sit, massaging meat and turning occasionally, at least 10 minutes. Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate with vegetable oil. Remove ribs from marinade and grill, turning once, until lightly charred and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.
