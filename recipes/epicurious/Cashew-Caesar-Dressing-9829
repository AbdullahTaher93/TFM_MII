Blend anchovies, cashews, lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder in a blender on low speed until cashews are broken up. Increase speed to high and blend until nuts are very finely ground. With motor running, gradually add oil and 2 Tbsp. water; blend, adding more water if too thick, until smooth. Season with salt. Dressing can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill.
