If using a top-down broiler, arrange rack on second-to-top rung. Heat broiler on high. Arrange bacon, fat side up, in 2 layers in a 13x9" metal baking dish. Pour oil over; bacon should be mostly submerged. Broil, checking often and watching carefully, until fat is partially rendered and edges start to crisp on top layer, 15â€“20 minutes. Transfer dish to a wire rack. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium. Working in batches, remove bacon from oil, letting oil drip back into dish, and cook until crisp, about 2 minutes on each side. Bacon can be broiled 5 days ahead. Cool submerged bacon completely in dish, then cover and chill.
