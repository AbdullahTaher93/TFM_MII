Cook pomegranate juice and sugar in a small pot over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and liquid is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, transfer to a heatproof container, and chill until cool, about 30 minutes. Pour mezcal, sparkling wine, and orange juice into a rocks glass filled with ice. Top with 1 Tbsp. Pomegranate Syrup. Pomegranate Syrup can be made 7 days ahead; chill in an airtight container.
