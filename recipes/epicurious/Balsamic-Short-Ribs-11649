Heat a large, deep, heavy casserole dish over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the ribs with salt and pepper and cook for 4–5 minutes on each side or until well browned. Remove from the dish and set aside. Wipe the dish with absorbent paper, add the onion and garlic and cook for 5 minutes or until golden. Return the ribs to the dish with the oregano, vinegar, tomatoes, stock, salt and pepper, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 2 1/2–3 hours or until the beef is very tender. Remove the ribs from the dish and keep warm. Strain the pan juices and skim the fat from the surface. Pour into a saucepan and simmer over high heat for 5–10 minutes or until the sauce has thickened. To make the basil gremolata, place the basil, lemon zest, garlic, oil, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix to combine. Divide the ribs among plates and spoon the sauce over. Top with the gremolata to serve.
