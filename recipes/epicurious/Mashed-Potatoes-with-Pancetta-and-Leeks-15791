Cook potatoes in pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, sauté pancetta in large skillet over medium heat until crisp, 10 minutes. Transfer pancetta to small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon oil to same skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add leeks and thyme; sauté until leeks are tender, about 5 minutes. Add carrot; sauté 4 minutes. Add zucchini; sauté until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 1 minute longer. Drain potatoes. Peel and return to same pot. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil and mash to chunky purée. Stir in pancetta and vegetable mixture. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over low heat before serving.)
