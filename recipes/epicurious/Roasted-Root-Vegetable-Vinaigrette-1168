Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the carrots, parsnips, and shallot with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Roast until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Set aside to cool. Combine the carrots, parsnips, shallot, remaining 1/3 cup oil, the chicken broth, apple juice concentrate, vinegar, maple syrup, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth.
