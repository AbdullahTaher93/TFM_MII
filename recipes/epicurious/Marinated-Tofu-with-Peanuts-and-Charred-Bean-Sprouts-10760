Place tofu on a baking sheet lined with several layers of paper towels; place several layers of paper towels on top and press gently to squeeze out liquid. Cut tofu into 3/4"-wide pieces and place in a baking dish. Whisk jalape√±o, soy sauce, brown sugar, and ginger in a small bowl, pour over tofu, and toss to coat. Let sit at least 30 minutes. Just before serving, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 cup bean sprouts and cook, undisturbed, until charred, about 3 minutes; season with salt. Spoon tofu over rice and top with charred and raw bean sprouts, scallions, peanuts, and mint. Serve with lime wedges.
