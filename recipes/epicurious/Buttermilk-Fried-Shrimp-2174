Whisk salt, cayenne, garlic powder, paprika, oregano, thyme, black pepper, and onion powder in a small bowl to blend. Attach a deep-fry thermometer to side of a heavy wide pot. Add enough oil to measure 2". Heat over medium heat to 350°F. Meanwhile, place shrimp and 2 tablespoons spice mix in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Pour buttermilk into another medium bowl. Whisk flour and cornmeal in another medium bowl. Dip seasoned shrimp briefly in buttermilk, then coat with flour mixture. Working in batches, fry shrimp, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve shrimp with rémoulade sauce.
