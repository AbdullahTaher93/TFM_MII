If using, pulse espresso beans in a food processor until very finely ground. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet or plate; set aside. Pulse coconut, almonds, and pumpkin seeds in food processor until very coarsely chopped. Transfer to a medium bowl. Pulse dates in food processor until finely chopped. Scrape down sides of bowl and add chia seeds. With the motor running, slowly stream in 1/4 cup very hot water and process until a paste forms. Add almond butter, ginger, turmeric, and salt; process until very smooth. Add coconut mixture and pulse until just combined. Scoop date mixture by the level tablespoon, roll into balls in between palms, then roll in reserved chopped espresso beans, pressing slightly to adhere. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet or plate and chill at least 1 hour. Bites can be made 7 days ahead. Chill in an airtight container, or freeze up to 3 months.
