Stir 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves; bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer 3 minutes. Chill until cold. (Simple syrup can be made 1 month ahead. Cover and keep chilled.) Place 8 coupe glasses or Champagne flutes in freezer and chill at least 2 hours. Place 1 cup ice, 1/4 cup gin, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 3 tablespoons simple syrup in cocktail shaker. Shake well, then strain into 2 chilled glasses or flutes. Repeat 3 more times with remaining ice cubes, gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup to make 6 more drinks. Divide Champagne among glasses and serve.
