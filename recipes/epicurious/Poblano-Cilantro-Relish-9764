Light a grill and preheat for for at least 10 minutes or preheat a grill pan. Skewer the garlic. Grill the garlic and poblanos over moderately high heat, turning frequently, until the garlic is charred and softened, about 5 minutes, and the poblanos are blackened all over, about 10 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a plate. Peel the garlic and transfer to a food processor. Peel the peppers, then core them and discard most of the seeds. Cut the peppers into strips and transfer to a food processor. Pulse the garlic and peppers until coarsely chopped. Add the cilantro, fish sauce, sugar and 1 tablespoon of lime juice and pulse to a chunky puree. Add the vegetable oil and process until incorporated. Season the relish with more lime juice, if desired, and serve.
