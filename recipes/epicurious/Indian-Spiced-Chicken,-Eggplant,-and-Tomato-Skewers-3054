Whisk garlic, ginger, coconut milk, lime zest and juice, tomato paste, salt, turmeric, cayenne, and cardamom in a large bowl. Transfer half of marinade to another large bowl. Add chicken to 1 bowl of marinade; toss to coat. Add eggplant, onion, and tomatoes to the other bowl; toss to coat. Cover and chill at least 1 hour. Thread each ingredient onto its own set of skewers: divide chicken among 6 skewers, tomatoes among 4, eggplant among 3, and onion on 1. Prepare a grill or grill pan for high heat; generously oil grates. Grill skewers, turning often, until well charred and cooked through, about 5 minutes for tomatoes, 10 minutes for chicken, and 15 minutes for eggplant and onion. Just before serving, toast naan on grill until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Top grilled chicken and vegetables with cilantro and serve with naan, lime wedges, and yogurt alongside. Ingredients can be marinated 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Skewers can be assembled 1 day ahead; cover and chill.
