Toss radishes in a small bowl with a couple pinches of salt. Let sit until salt begins to draw out water from radishes, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, toast pine nuts in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, tossing often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Massage radishes to release liquid, gently at first, then more vigorously as they start to expel water. Squeeze out excess liquid, then finely chop radishes (you should have about 1 cup). Mix radishes, yogurt, lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 1/2 tsp. lemon zest in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Divide yogurt among bowls, top with pine nuts and more lemon zest and drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Serve with cucumber spears for dipping. Yogurt can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Top with pine nuts and lemon zest just before serving.
