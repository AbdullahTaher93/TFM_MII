Combine currants and vinegar in a small bowl; set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium; cook onion and ginger, stirring occasionally, until softened, 8–10 minutes. Stir in squash, rice, and 1 1/4 cups water; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 15–18 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff rice with a fork, and let sit covered 10 minutes. Drain currants and serve pilaf topped with drained currants and toasted unsweetened coconut flakes.
