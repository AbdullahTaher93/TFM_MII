Heat butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar, until butter is melted. Meanwhile, very finely grind sesame seeds in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Pulse cookies in a food processor until finely ground. Pour butter mixture into food processor; add salt and ground sesame and pulse to combine. Using a measuring cup, press cookie mixture firmly onto bottom and up the sides of a 9" pie dish. Freeze until very cold, 20–25 minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake crust until firm and slightly darkened in color, 15–18 minutes. If crust slides down sides, gently press back up. Let cool. Preheat oven to 350°F. Roast sweet potatoes on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet until tender, 50–60 minutes. Slice open lengthwise and let cool. Scoop out flesh from skins (you should have about 1 cup); pulse in food processor until very smooth. Discard skins. Whisk brown sugar, butter, and miso in a medium bowl until smooth. Add egg yolks and egg and whisk just to incorporate. Whisk in sweet potato purée, then cream. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Pour filling into crust. Bake pie, rotating halfway through, until filling is set (it will still wobble slightly in the very center), 50–60 minutes. Transfer dish to a wire rack and let pie cool before slicing, about 2 hours. Serve pie topped with whipped cream or scoops of vanilla ice cream.
