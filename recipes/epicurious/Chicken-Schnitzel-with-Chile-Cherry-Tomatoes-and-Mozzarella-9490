Preheat oven to 475°F. Using a meat mallet, pound each chicken breast to 1/4" thick. Place the flour, salt and pepper in a medium bowl and mix to combine. Place the eggs and milk in a separate bowl and whisk to combine. Place the matzo meal in a third bowl. Dust the chicken with the flour, dip into the egg mixture and press into the crumbs to coat. Pour oil into a large frying pan to a depth of 1" and heat over medium heat. Cook the chicken in batches, turning, for 2 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Place the tomatoes in a bowl and lightly crush with a fork. Add the vincotto, chile, lemon zest, salt and pepper and mix to combine. Place the chicken in a roasting pan and top with the tomato mixture and mozzarella. Roast for 10–12 minutes or until the cheese is melted and golden. Divide among serving plates and top with the pesto and mint, if using, to serve.
