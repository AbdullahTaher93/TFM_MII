Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake bacon on 2 foil-lined rimmed baking sheets, rotating halfway through, until bacon is brown and crisp, 18-20 minutes; drain on paper towels. Meanwhile, mix cheese, mayonnaise, red pepper, and jalapeños in a medium bowl; season pimiento cheese with salt and pepper. Spread half of bread slices with pimiento cheese. Build sandwiches with bacon, tomatoes, mixed greens, and remaining bread slices. Do ahead: Pimiento cheese can be made 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Sandwiches can be assembled 3 hours ahead; wrap tightly and chill.
