Toast the almonds in a dry skillet over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whip the cream with an electric beater until it is thickened. Add the sugar and continue beating until soft peaks are formed. Gently fold in the yogurt and almond extract. The cream will keep in the refrigerator, covered, for 2 days. Core and slice the pears and arrange slices of half a pear on each serving plate. Top each with 3 tablespoons of the cream and sprinkle with almonds.
