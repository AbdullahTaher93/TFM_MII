In a saucepan, combine the claret (or Burgundy), orange and lemon peels, cinnamon stick, nutmeg, cloves, and sugar. Simmer the mixture over low heat for 5 to 8 minutes. Strain it and serve hot in heat-proof glasses or mugs rinsed beforehand with boiling water. Garnish each with an orange slice stuck with a clove, if desired.
