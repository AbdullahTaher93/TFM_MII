Toss 4 cups quartered hulled strawberries (from 1 pound whole), 3 sliced Persian cucumbers, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl and let sit 10 minutes to allow sugar to dissolve and flavors to meld. Meanwhile, mix 1/2 cup crème fraîche, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl; set lemon cream aside. Pulse 1/4 cup unsalted, roasted pistachios, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt in a food processor until nuts are just finely ground (do not overprocess or you'll end up with nut butter). Divide fruit salad among plates and spoon some of the reserved lemon cream over; sprinkle with ground seasoned pistachios. Lemon cream can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
