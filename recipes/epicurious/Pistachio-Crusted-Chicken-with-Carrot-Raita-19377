Heat oven to 350Â°. In a food processor, puree yogurt, cilantro, garlic, lemon juice, cumin and salt until smooth. Transfer 1/3 cup yogurt mixture to a large resealable plastic bag; add chicken and shake until coated. Add carrots to processor and puree with remaining yogurt sauce; refrigerate carrot raita. Spread pistachios on a wide plate. Remove chicken from yogurt mixture and dredge in pistachio crumbs, pressing them to adhere until fully coated. Shake off any excess. In a large ovenproof skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer pan to oven and bake until cooked through, 5 minutes. Serve cutlets with carrot raita, and garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.
