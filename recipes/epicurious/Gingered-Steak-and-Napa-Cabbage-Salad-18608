In a shallow bowl stir together marinade ingredients. Add filets to marinade, turning to coat, and marinate at room temperature 15 minutes. Remove filets from marinade, letting excess drip off, and reserve marinade. In a 10-inch non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saut√© filets about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat. Transfer filets to a cutting board. In any drippings remaining in skillet cook mushrooms with salt, stirring frequently, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add reserved marinade, water, and honey and bring to a boil. Remove skillet from heat and cool mixture 10 minutes. In a large bowl combine cabbage, mizuna or arugula, bell pepper, pear, scallions, and all but 4 sprigs coriander. Add mushroom mixture and toss to coat. Cut filets into thin slices. Mound cabbage mixture on 4 dinner plates and arrange steak slices on top. Garnish with reserved coriander sprigs.
