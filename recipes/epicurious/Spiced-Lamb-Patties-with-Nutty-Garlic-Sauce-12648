Whisk garlic, almond butter, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 2 tablespoons oil, and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Set sauce aside. Using your hands, gently mix lamb, onion, parsley, coriander, cumin, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl just to combine. Form into twelve 3/4"-thick patties. Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat. Working in 2 batches, cook patties, pressing slightly to flatten, until browned on the outside but still pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet; let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, toss cabbage, cucumber, radishes, and remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 2 tablespoons oil in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Serve lamb patties with pita bread, salad, herbs, and reserved sauce.
