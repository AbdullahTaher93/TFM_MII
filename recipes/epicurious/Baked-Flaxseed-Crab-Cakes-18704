Position a rack in the center of the oven. Coat a baking sheet with olive oil cooking spray. Pick through the crabmeat to make sure there aren’t any shells. Set aside. Put the scallions, fresh herbs, mayonnaise, and flaxseeds in a large bowl and stir well to combine. Add the crabmeat and give it a gentle toss. Place the oats, hemp seeds, and seafood seasoning on a plate. Toss with your fingers to mix. Form the crabmeat mixture into four 4-inch-wide patties and press into the oat-seed mixture. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Mist the tops with olive oil cooking spray and transfer to the oven. Broil for 3–5 minutes until the tops are golden. Place the romaine in a large bowl along with the olive oil and the vinegar and toss well. Divide the romaine salad among four plates. Top each plate with two crab cakes and serve immediately.
