1. Combine all the ingredients in a deep pot, and bring to a boil. Moderate the heat, and reduce for as long as an hour, until all the excess liquid boils away and what remains is thick and jamlike in texture. Be sure to taste the chutney at several points, and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Chutney should be deeply flavored and complex, with at least a bit of spicy heat. If you like the bright taste of green chilies, add more minced jalape√±os during the last 10 minutes of cooking. 2. Ladle the hot chutney into four prepared pint jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Seal, and process in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes. Allow to cure for a month before eating.
