If using fresh peas, cook in a medium saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 3 minutes (if using frozen peas, do not cook). Drain, transfer to a bowl of ice water, and let sit until cold, about 3 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Melt 1 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a food processor. Add peas, pepper, lemon zest, 1 tsp. salt, and remaining 1/2 cup butter; pulse until just combined. Pea butter can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
