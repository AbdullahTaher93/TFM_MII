Pour the maraschino in a straight-sided 2-ounce liqueur glass and carefully slide in the unbroken egg yolk. Gently pour in the Benedictine, letting it trickle down the side of the slightly tilted glass, or pouring it over the back of a teaspoon held just above the glass. Add the brandy in the same way, making sure that the ingredients don't mix.
