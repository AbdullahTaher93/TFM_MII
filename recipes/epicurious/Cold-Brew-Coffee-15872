Place ground coffee in 12-cup container. Slowly pour 6 cups cool water over grounds. Stir very gently just until grounds are moistened. Seal container and chill 24 hours. Strain coffee grounds through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup or bowl. Strain again through coffee filter into a large bowl or 3-cup (or larger) resealable container. (Alternately, skip the straining and use a thick filter, like for a Chemex.) To serve, pour over ice and dilute 1:1 with water or milk.
