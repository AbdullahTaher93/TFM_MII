Bring chiles, garlic, oil, and 1 tsp. salt to a gentle simmer (oil should be barely bubbling) in a small saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat immediately to maintain gentle simmer and cook until chiles and garlic are tender, 1â€“1 1/2 hours. Let cool. Confit chiles can be made 2 weeks ahead. Cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
