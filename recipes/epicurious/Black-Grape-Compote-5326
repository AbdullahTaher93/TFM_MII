Bring 2 star anise pods, 3 cups seedless black grapes, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, and a pinch of salt to a boil in a large skillet, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until grapes burst and mixture is syrupy, 8â€“10 minutes. Discard star anise; whisk 1 tablespoon unsalted butter into compote. Let cool.
