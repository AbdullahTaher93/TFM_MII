Preheat oven to 400Â° with rack near top. Line two 12-cup muffin pans with 15 liners, spacing them evenly between the 2 pans. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter, sugar, and salt for 1-2 minutes, until fluffy. Incorporate eggs slowly, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add all-purpose flour, cornmeal, rye flour, and baking powder and mix until incorporated. Add canola oil, maple syrup, and buttermilk. Scrape mixer bowl well, making sure everything is incorporated. Add diced cheddar, 4 tbsp Parmesan, bacon, and chives. Mix just until dispersed, folding by hand to be sure. Fill muffin cups to the very top. Toss grated cheddar with remaining 2 tbsp Parmesan in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over muffins. Bake for about 15 minutes, until nicely browned. Garnish with chopped rosemary.
