Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Meanwhile, heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium. Add ramp bulbs; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and tender, about 4 minutes. When pasta is nearly done, add ramp greens to bulbs and toss to coat. Drain pasta, reserving 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking liquid. Add pasta to skillet along with 1/2 cup cooking liquid; toss to coat. Cook, tossing often and adding more cooking liquid as needed, until a thick, glossy sauce coats pasta. Add grated Parmesan and lemon zest, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Divide among bowls, top with shaved Parmesan, and serve with lemon halves.
