Break rice apart with your hands or a spoon so grains are individual and not in clumps. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add egg and cook, breaking up with chopsticks or a rubber spatula, just until it is in small clumps and mostly set, about 1 minute. Add rice, toss to distribute egg, and cook, undisturbed, drizzling 1 Tbsp. oil around edge of pan, until rice begins to crisp, about 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup chives and 1/2 tsp. coriander to rice and cook, tossing occasionally, until rice is heated through and crisp in spots, about 4 minutes. Add mushroom soy sauce and toss to combine; taste and adjust seasoning with more soy sauce if needed. Transfer fried rice to a plate. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in same skillet over medium. Cook stuffing, turning occasionally, until golden brown all over, about 5 minutes. Add kale and mushrooms and cook, tossing gently, just until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Return fried rice to skillet and toss to combine. Serve topped with more chives and coriander. Rice can be cooked (but not fried) 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
