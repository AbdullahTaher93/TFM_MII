Toast walnuts in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Let cool. Coarsely chop walnuts and toss in a small bowl with garlic, parsley, and lemon zest; season gremolata with salt and pepper. Gently toss endives, oranges, oil, and half of gremolata in a medium bowl; transfer to a platter. Top with remaining gremolata and squeeze lemon over. Do ahead: Gremolata, without garlic, can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Stir in garlic just before serving.
