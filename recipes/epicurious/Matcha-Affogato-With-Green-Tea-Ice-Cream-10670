Place sugar and matcha in a medium bowl. Bring almond milk to a bare simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour a small amount of hot almond milk over matcha mixture and whisk to make a loose paste. Add remaining almond milk, whisking until matcha and sugar dissolve; chill until cold, 15â€“20 minutes. Divide ice cream among 4 small serving bowls or coffee cups. Top with cornflakes and pour matcha milk into each bowl, dividing evenly. Matcha milk can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
