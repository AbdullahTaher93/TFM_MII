Scrape vanilla seeds into a medium saucepan; add pod, chile, orange zest, hibiscus, sugar, and 2 cups boiling water. Let steep until infusion cools to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing on solids. Stir in lime juice and 2 cups cold water; chill agua fresca 1 hour. Divide agua fresca among ice-filled glasses. Garnish with lime wheels. Agua fresca can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.
