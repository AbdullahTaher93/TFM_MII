Pulse chickpeas in a food processor, scraping down sides as needed, until they resemble finely chopped nuts (the texture should be uneven, with some slightly larger pieces visible), about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl. Pulse onion, jalapeño, garlic, cilantro, and parsley in food processor, scraping down sides as needed, until coarsely chopped, about 1 minute. Mix into chickpeas, then mix in chickpea flour, salt, baking powder, cardamom, and cumin. Form into ping-pong–size balls. Pour oil into a large heavy pot to a depth of 3". Fit pot with thermometer and heat oil over medium-high until thermometer registers 330°F. Working in batches, cook falafel, turning occasionally, until deep brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels; let sit 5 minutes. Serve falafel with salad, tahini sauce, and pita.
