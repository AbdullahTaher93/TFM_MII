Finely chop shallot. Pat pork dry and season with salt and pepper. In a skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté pork until just cooked through, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer pork to a warm platter and keep warm, covered. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat from skillet and sauté shallot, stirring, 15 seconds. Add wine and simmer until reduced by about half. Stir in mustard and stock and simmer sauce until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Just before serving, add butter to sauce, stirring until incorporated, and season with salt and pepper. Serve pork with sauce.
