Start by making the curried cauliflower. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C/gas mark 7). In a bowl, toss the cauliflower with the spices, thyme leaves and olive oil, mixing well. Transfer to an ovenproof dish and roast in the oven for 10-15 minutes, until lightly brown on top. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Place all the hummus ingredients into a food processor or use a handheld blender to process until smooth. If necessary, use a little of the reserved chickpea liquid to thin the mixture to a smooth purée. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. To serve, spread the hummus on the bread and top with the curried cauliflower. Sprinkle the scallion (spring onion) on top and drizzle with the olive oil.
