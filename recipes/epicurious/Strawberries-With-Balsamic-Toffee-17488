Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). To make the balsamic toffee, place the sugar and balsamic in a bowl and mix to combine. Spread evenly onto 2 baking trays lined with non-stick baking paper and bake for 8 minutes or until bubbling and caramelized. Set aside to cool and harden, roughly chop and set aside. Place the strawberries, vanilla, sugar and water in bowl and toss to combine. Divide the yoghurt between glasses and top with the strawberries, basil leaves and balsamic toffee to serve.
