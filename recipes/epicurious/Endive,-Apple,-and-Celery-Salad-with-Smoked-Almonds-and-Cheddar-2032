Combine 1 Tbsp. vinegar and 3 cups cold water in a medium bowl. Add apple slices and let soak. Meanwhile, whisk mustard, kosher salt, and remaining 1/4 cup vinegar in a medium bowl, then whisk in oil in a slow, steady stream. Drain and pat apple slices dry. Combine apple slices, endives, celery stalks, cheese, and half of the almonds in a large bowl. Drizzle dressing over salad. Gently toss until salad is evenly dressed, then season with sea salt and pepper. Top with chives, celery leaves, and remaining almonds.
