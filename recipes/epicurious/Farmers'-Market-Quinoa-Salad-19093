Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop. Meanwhile, cook green beans and sugar snap peas in a pot of salted boiling water until no longer raw but still very crunchy, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water and let sit until cold, about 3 minutes. Drain, pat dry, and thinly slice into bite-size pieces. Blend herbs, oil, vinegar, mustard, and 2 tablespoons toasted pistachios in a blender, adding water by the tablespoonful if dressing is too thick, until smooth and the consistency of heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper. Toss beans, peas, broccoli, pea shoots, quinoa, and remaining toasted pistachios in a medium bowl to combine. Drizzle salad with dressing and toss again to nicely coat everything; season with salt and pepper.
