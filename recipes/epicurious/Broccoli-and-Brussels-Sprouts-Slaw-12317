Trim broccoli stalk and peel. Halve head lengthwise. Starting at the crown, thinly slice both halves, including the stalk (alternatively, you can slice both broccoli and brussels sprouts in a food processor). Combine broccoli and brussels sprouts in a large bowl and toss with 1/2 tsp. salt. Let sit 10 minutes to soften slightly. Meanwhile, chop anchovies, if using, then mash to a paste with the side of a chef's knife. Combine anchovies, grated Parmesan, oil, and lemon juice in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle over slaw; toss to coat. Serve topped with olives, almonds, and shaved Parmesan. Slaw (without almonds) can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Add almonds just before serving.
