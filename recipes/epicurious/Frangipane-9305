1. If using whole or sliced almonds, grind them in the food processor as finely as possible without turning them into a paste. Set aside. 2. Using the stand mixer or a medium bowl and the handheld mixer, cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes if using a stand mixer or 3 to 4 minutes if using a handheld mixer, or until light. Add the ground almonds or the almond flour and beat on medium speed for 1 minute, or until thoroughly incorporated. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Or, use a medium bowl and a wooden spoon; creaming the butter and sugar will take 4 to 5 minutes and incorporating the nuts or almond flour will take about 1 1/2 minutes. 3. With the mixer on low speed or with the wooden spoon, beat in the eggs until blended. Add the all-purpose flour, vanilla, and salt and beat just until combined.
