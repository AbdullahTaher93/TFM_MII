Grill tomatoes, turning occasionally, until skins are blackened and split, about 4 minutes. Press through a sieve set over a medium bowl; discard solids. Whisk in anchovies, garlic, harissa, vinegar, and 2 tablespoons oil; season with salt and pepper. Spoon half of sauce onto a platter. Place eggplants on top, season with salt, and spoon remaining sauce over. Let sit 30 minutes to let flavors meld. Drizzle with oil, top with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges. DO AHEAD: Smoky Tomato Sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
