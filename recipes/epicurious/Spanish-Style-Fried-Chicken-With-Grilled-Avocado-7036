Combine garlic, buttermilk, Aleppo-style pepper, cumin, coriander, 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. black pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken and toss to coat, then chill at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Whisk flour, cayenne, and remaining 3 Tbsp. paprika in a medium shallow bowl. Fit a large heavy pot with deep-fry thermometer. Pour in oil to a depth of 2"; heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350°F. Reduce heat to medium and raise or lower as needed to maintain a temperature of 350°F. Working in batches, remove chicken from marinade, shaking off excess, and dredge in flour mixture. Fry chicken, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Heat a grill pan over medium. Brush avocado with oil; season with remaining 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until lightly charred, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter and arrange avocado alongside; serve with spicy mayonnaise, if desired.
