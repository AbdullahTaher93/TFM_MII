Combine the sugar, water, ginger, and lime zest in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is clear. Turn off the heat and allow the ginger and lime to steep in the syrup for 3 hours. Strain the syrup into an airtight glass jar. Store for up to 1 month in the refrigerator
