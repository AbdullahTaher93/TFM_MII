Using a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic, salt, and black pepper to form a smooth paste.
Whisk in the sour orange juice and oregano until well combined. Place the sour orange
mixture in a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Place the lard or olive oil in a separate small saucepan and bring to a simmer over
medium heat. Remove the cover of the saucepan away from your body and only enough to safely
pour the lard or olive oil inside in one motion then replace the cover immediately. This
should be done carefully because the liquid will bubble and spurt. Leave covered until the
popping sound subsides, 3 to 5 minutes. This sauce does not keep well and should be used
immediately.
