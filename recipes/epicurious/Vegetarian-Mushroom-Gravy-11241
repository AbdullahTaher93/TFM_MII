Pulse garlic and thyme in a food processor, scraping down sides as necessary. Add oil, 2 tsp. kosher salt, and paprika and continue to pulse until a thick paste forms, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl. Heat 1 Tbsp. garlic-oil mixture in a medium pot over medium-low until beginning to brown and smells fragrant, about 30 seconds. Cook mushrooms, shallot, and bay leaves, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add broth, bring to a simmer, and cook 30 minutes. Strain mushroom mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; wipe out pot. Cook flour and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in pot over medium heat, stirring constantly, until nutty brown and thickened, about 8 minutes. Add wine, bring to a simmer, and cook 3 minutes. Add mushroom broth, parsley, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and remaining 1/4 tsp. kosher salt, and return to a simmer. Season to taste. Gravy can be made 3 days ahead; transfer to an airtight container and chill. Heat in a small pot over medium, whisking constantly and adding warm water or vegetable broth 1 Tbsp. at a time if needed, until smooth.
