Place a baking sheet on a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 500°F. Mix garlic, tomato paste, cinnamon, cumin, paprika, and 3/4 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Mix in lamb. Working with 1 piece of dough and keeping remaining piece covered, gently stretch dough into a 10x8" oval and transfer to a lightly floured parchment-lined baking sheet. (If dough springs back, cover and let rest 10 minutes, then stretch again, resting as needed.) Crumble half of the lamb mixture over dough and brush edges with 1 Tbsp. oil. Slide onto preheated baking sheet and bake until crust is golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Transfer pizza to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining dough, lamb mixture, and 1 Tbsp. oil. Drizzle pizzas with more oil. Toss onion, parsley, and lemon juice in a bowl; season with salt. Scatter over pizzas; sprinkle with red pepper flakes.
