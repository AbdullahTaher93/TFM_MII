Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring often, until lightly golden, 5–8 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until vegetables have reduced in volume by two-thirds, 15–20 minutes. Add paprika and cook, stirring often, 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing, until browned and softened, 8–10 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Repeat with 2 tablespoons oil and remaining mushrooms; reserve skillet. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8–10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in reserved skillet over medium-low heat. Cook garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Toss in soffritto, mushrooms, pasta, lemon juice, 2 tablespoons chives, and half of Parmesan, thinning with pasta cooking liquid as needed; season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with ricotta, eggs, if using, more chives, and remaining Parmesan and drizzle with oil.
