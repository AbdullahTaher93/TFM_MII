Preheat oven to 375°F. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-low. Add pico de gallo and 1 tsp. salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are very soft and liquid has reduced by three-quarters, about 25 minutes. Stir in feta. Gently crack eggs into skillet, one at a time, over tomatoes, spacing evenly. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer skillet to oven and bake shakshuka until eggs are just set, 14–16 minutes. Serve hot in skillet.
