To make the chocolate sauce, place a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the chocolate, and water, vigorously stirring until completely melted and smooth. Let it come to a low simmer until small bubbles appear around the outside. Add sugar, honey and keep at a low simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter and salt. Chocolate sauce will smooth out at is cools to room temperature. Store in an airtight container. In a bowl, gently toss together the raspberries, sugar, elderflower liqueur, and lemon juice. Let stand in the refrigerator for 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours) before serving. Assemble the sundae: Scoop ice cream into individual bowls. Top with chocolate sauce, almonds, and macerated raspberries.
