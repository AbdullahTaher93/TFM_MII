In a 4- to 5-quart heavy saucepan with an electric mixer beat together half-and-half, cream, sugar, and yolks until combined well. Cook mixture over moderate heat, continuing to beat, until slightly thickened and a thermometer registers 170Â°F, about 7 to 10 minutes, and remove pan from heat. Continue to beat mixture until slightly cooled and stir in vanilla and nutmeg. Transfer eggnog to a bowl and chill, covered, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days. Just before serving, thin eggnog with milk to desired consistency. Serve eggnog with rum or brandy on the side for guests to add to taste.
