Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook chickpeas, cumin, and cayenne, shaking to coat, until heated through. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, shaking occasionally, until chickpeas are golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and season immediately with salt. Meanwhile, pulse parsley and mint in a food processor until finely chopped. Add oil, lemon juice, honey, and salt and pulse to combine. Toss quinoa with 1/2 cup dressing in a large bowl. Divide among serving bowls. Toss chicken with 1/4 cup dressing in same large bowl. Arrange chicken, cucumbers, avocados, and watercress over quinoa. Top with chickpeas, pickled onions, and sesame seeds. Serve remaining dressing on side for drizzling.
