In a large, deep saucepan over medium heat, warm 2 to 4 tablespoons of the oil. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, until softened. Add the plum tomatoes, tomato sauce, grape juice, sugar, and salt. Using an immersion blender, purée the sauce as it cooks. Add the heavy cream and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Place the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the bottom of a large pasta serving bowl. Add some of the pasta to the bowl and the a few ladles of the sauce. Continue layering the pasta and sauce into the bowl until all has been transferred to the serving bowl. Using tongs or 2 large forks, integrate the sauce into the pasta. Taste and season further with the salt. Continue to toss until well combined. Top with the mozzarella cheese and garnish with the basil. Season with the red pepper flakes and serve hot.
