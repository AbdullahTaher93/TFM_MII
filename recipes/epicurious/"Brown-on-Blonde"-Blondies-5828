Crank the oven to 350ºF. Coat the insides of an 8-inch square baking pan with non-stick cooking spray and line with a sling of parchment paper. Melt the butter in an 8-inch sauté pan over medium heat. When it's done bubbling, add the walnuts and pecans and cook until the nuts are toasted and the butter smells nutty, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a large heatproof bowl and strain the butter away from the nuts. Set both aside to cool for 30 minutes. Then, chop the nuts coarsely and set aside. While you're waiting, beat the almond butter into the cooled butter, followed by the brown sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Beat until completely smooth, about 1 minute, then stir in the flour mixture. Finish by folding in the nuts and transferring to the prepared pan. The batter will be thick, so I suggest a rubber or silicone spatula. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the edges are deeply brown and the top is dry and cracked. Remove from the pan and cool on a rack for about 30 minutes. Slice into squares and devour with plenty of frosty almond milk.
