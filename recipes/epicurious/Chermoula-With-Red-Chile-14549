Toast peppercorns and cumin seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let cool. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and pulse or grind until coarsely ground. Place spices in a small bowl and mix in cardamom. Pound cilantro in mortar and pestle (or pulse in a food processor) until it's bruised and releases some of its moisture. Mix into spices along with parsley, oil, lemon juice, chiles, and garlic; season generously with salt. Chermoula can be made 6 hours ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
