Bring chile and coconut milk to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; discard chile. Add vinegar and sugar, stirring until sugar dissolves; season with salt. Let cool. Cook garlic and oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until garlic is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer garlic to paper towels to drain; season with salt. Increase heat to medium-high. Add pork and red pepper flakes to skillet; season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up pork and pressing firmly to help brown, until cooked through and crisped in spots, 6.8 minutes. Spoon sauce into bowls and top with garlic, basil, cilantro, mint, peanuts, and shichimi togarashi. Spoon pork along with some pan drippings over; drizzle with lime juice. Top with lychees and onion.
