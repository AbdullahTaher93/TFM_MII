Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium. Cook mustard seeds, shaking pan, until they start to pop, about 2 minutes. Add onion, garlic, ginger, and chiles and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, 5–8 minutes. Stir in curry powder and cook, stirring often, until mixture is very fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add sugar, both vinegars, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and 2 tsp. salt and cook, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add tomatoes, increase heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until water evaporates and mixture is thick (you should be able to see the bottom of the pot when you drag a spoon through it), 40–50 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice and cayenne. Season with more salt if needed. Chutney can be made 1 week ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
