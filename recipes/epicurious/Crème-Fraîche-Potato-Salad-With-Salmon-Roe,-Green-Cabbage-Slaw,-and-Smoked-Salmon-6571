In a bowl toss together the cabbage, the dill, the oil, the vinegar, and the salt and chill the slaw, covered. Cut the potatoes, unpeeled, into eights and in a steamer set over simmering water steam them, covered for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are just tender. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, toss them while they are still warm with the oil, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste, and let them cool, stirring gently once or twice until they are lukewarm. Add the crème fraîche, the roe, and the lemon juice, stirring the salad gently to avoid breaking up the potatoes. Arrange the smoked salmon around the edge of a platter, spread the slaw in the center, and mound the potato salad over the slaw.
