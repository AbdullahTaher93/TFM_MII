1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 2. Peel parsnips and carrots; depending on size, cut lengthwise in half or quarters, about 4 inches long. 3. In a large bowl, toss parsnips, carrots, onions, and garlic with 1/2 cup olive oil, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. 4. Spread vegetables on one large sheet pan or two smaller pans, and place in oven. Roast for about an hour, turning vegetables once or twice, to get a nice crust on both sides. 5. Meanwhile, heat large skillet, and film with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add tomatoes, cut side down, and caramelize (no more than 10 minutes). Saut√© in two batches. Remove to bowl, and set aside. 6. While the vegetables are cooking, whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, capers, maple syrup, and mustard. 7. Place warm roasted root vegetables on serving platter, and pour dressing over the vegetables. Top with caramelized tomatoes.
