Combine tea and 1 1/4 cups boiling water in a heatproof bowl. Let steep 5 minutes, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a measuring glass (you should have 1 cup). Let cool. Meanwhile, bring honey, thyme, 2 rosemary sprigs, and 1/2 cup water to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring to combine. Let cool; discard herbs. Combine tea, honey syrup, lemon juice, bourbon, Cognac, and bitters in a large pitcher or punch bowl. Add 2 cups ice and stir until ice is melted and punch is very cold. Serve punch in tumblers filled with ice, garnished with rosemary sprigs and lemon wheels. Syrup and tea can be made 3 days ahead; cover separately and chill. Punch can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill.
