Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle each half of squash with 1/4 tsp. salt, then place facedown on prepared baking sheet along with onion quarters. Combine turmeric, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. allspice, and 1/8 tsp. cayenne in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Arrange chicken skin side up alongside squash and onions on baking sheet. Brush tops of chicken with 1 Tbsp. olive oil. Bake until interior of squash and onions are fork-tender, chicken skin is crispy, and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken registers 165°F, 35–45 minutes; if chicken is done before squash, remove from oven and let rest until squash is finished cooking. Meanwhile, whisk lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, and remaining 3 Tbsp. oil, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. allspice, and 1/8 tsp. cayenne in a large bowl. Finely chop onion quarters and transfer to bowl with dressing. Using a fork, scrape squash crosswise to pull strands from shells into bowl with dressing; discard shells. Add pistachios, pomegranate seeds, dill, and mint and toss to coat. Divide chicken among plates, top with dill and mint, and serve alongside squash mixture.
