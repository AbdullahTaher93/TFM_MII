Pour oil into a large heavy skillet fitted with thermometer to come 1/2" up sides. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350Â°F.  Place breadcrumbs in a shallow dish or rimmed baking sheet. Season chicken all over with salt and pepper on a rimmed baking sheet. Spread 1/4 cup pesto all over chicken. Dip chicken into breadcrumbs, turning to coat and pressing with your fingertips to adhere. Carefully add chicken to hot oil, then reduce heat to medium. Fry 4 minutes, then flip and continue to fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack. Serve chicken with pesto alongside for dipping.
