Toast pine nuts in a dry small skillet over medium-high, tossing often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool. Combine onion and lime juice in a medium bowl; season with salt. Let sit until onions are slightly softened, 10â€“15 minutes. Just before serving, toss in mint and pine nuts; taste and season with salt as needed. Top with sumac and urfa biber and drizzle with oil.
