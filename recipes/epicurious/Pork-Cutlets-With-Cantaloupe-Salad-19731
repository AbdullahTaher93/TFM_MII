Prick pork cutlets all over with a fork; season with salt. Transfer to a large resealable plastic bag; add coarsely grated cantaloupe, 2 Tbsp. lime juice, and oil. Seal bag and toss to coat; chill 1 hour. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Remove pork from marinade and grill, turning, until browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes; transfer to a platter. Toss together scallions, chile, thinly sliced cantaloupe, cilantro, fish sauce, and remaining 2 Tbsp. lime juice. Arrange salad over pork; top with peanuts.
