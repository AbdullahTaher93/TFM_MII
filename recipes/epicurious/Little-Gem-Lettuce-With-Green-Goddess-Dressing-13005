Blend anchovies, garlic, mayonnaise, sour cream, basil, parsley, tarragon, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 4 1/2 tsp. oil in a blender until smooth with only a few flecks of green; season dressing with salt. Combine lettuce, radishes, and remaining 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. lemon juice in a large bowl, drizzle with oil, and season with salt; toss to combine. Top salad with a few spoonfuls of dressing; reserve remaining dressing for another use (like a turkey sandwich!). Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
