Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment or wax paper. Heat chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Fold marshmallows and 1/2 cup candies into chocolate until evenly combined. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of chocolate mixture onto prepared baking sheets; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup candies. Chill until set, about 30 minutes. Serve at room temperature. Candies can be made 5 days ahead; transfer to an airtight container and chill.
