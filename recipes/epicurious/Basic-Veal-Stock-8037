1. In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns, stirring until softened. Add the bones and cover with 12 cups cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 3 hours, skimming the foam periodically. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl. The stock is ready to use, or chill and freeze for future soups and stews.
