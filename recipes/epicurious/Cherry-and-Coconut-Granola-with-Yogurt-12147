Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In a large bowl, combine oats, almonds, coconut, sesame seeds, and cherries. In a separate bowl, stir together coconut oil, honey, maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt. Pour wet mixture over dry mixture and stir well to combine. Spread over a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake granola until golden brown along edges, 20 to 25 minutes, tossing gently from time to time. Serve granola with yogurt and fruit, if desired.
