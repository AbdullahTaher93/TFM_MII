Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 275°F. Slice garlic, sprinkle with salt, and mash to a paste on a cutting board using the side of a chef’s knife; place in a small bowl. Mix in rosemary, oil, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes. Season ribs generously with salt and pepper and place in a medium cast-iron skillet. Coat all over with garlic paste and cover skillet tightly with foil. Cook on upper rack in oven, checking for doneness after 1 1/2 hours, until meat is fork-tender and falling off the bone, 2 1/2–3 hours. Remove from oven. Meanwhile, place cauliflower in a small baking dish. Rub all over with oil; season with salt and pepper. Cover with foil and place in oven next to ribs. Bake until cauliflower is very easily pierced with a paring knife, 1 1/2–2 1/2 hours. Transfer hot cauliflower to a blender and add cream. Blend until very smooth; season with salt and pepper. Place in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat. While the ribs and cauliflower are cooking, scatter hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast on bottom rack, tossing once, until golden brown, 30–35 minutes. Let cool, then rub together in a kitchen towel to remove skins, if using skin-on nuts. Coarsely chop and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 450°F. Uncover ribs and return to oven, placing on top rack. Roast, basting with fat from skillet every couple of minutes, until a deep brown crust develops, 12–15 minutes. Toss celery, celery leaves, parsley, and reserved hazelnuts in a medium bowl to combine. Drizzle with oil and vinegar and toss to coat; season celery salad with salt and pepper. Serve short ribs over cauliflower purée with celery salad on top.
