1. Place the lemon peels in a bowl with the sugar (save the lemons for juicing). Muddle the peels until the sugar looks slightly moistened, then let sit covered for at least 1 hour, or overnight. 2. In a large punch bowl, combine the gin, Aperol, St. Germain, and juices. Add the lemon peel mixture and let sit for 15 minutes. Remove the peels. Right before serving, add the ice block and ros√©. Garnish the punch bowl with the lemon wheels.
