1. Thread a cherry tomato onto a skewer followed by a piece of basil, a mozzarella ball, and a bread cube. Repeat so that the skewer has two of every item. Add a third cherry tomato on the end of the skewer. Snap the pointed end off the skewer and discard. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. 2. Pack the skewers in a container or wrap them gently in aluminum foil.
