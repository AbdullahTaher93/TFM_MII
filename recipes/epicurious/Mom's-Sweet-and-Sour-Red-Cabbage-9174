1. Using a box grater, mandoline, or a coarse Microplane grater, grate the cabbage. In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saut√© for 2 minutes. 2. Lower the heat to medium; add the cabbage and apples and stir to combine. Add the juniper berries, allspice berries, cloves, bay leaf, salt, pepper, jelly, vinegar, sugar, and 1/2 cup (120ml) of water and stir to combine. Turn the heat to low, cover, and cook for 40 minutes, until the cabbage is tender. 3. Remove the juniper berries, allspice berries, cloves, and bay leaf. Serve the cabbage hot or at room temperature. Refrigerate for up to 4 days. Leftovers can also be frozen in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
