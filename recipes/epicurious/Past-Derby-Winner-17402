In a cocktail shaker, muddle the mint leaves with the bitters and lemon juice until the mint is slightly darkened but not completely crushed. Add the mint simple syrup and bourbon. Add about a half cup of ice and shake vigorously until well chilled, about 30 seconds. Strain drink into a Champagne flute, top with sparkling wine, and garnish with a mint leaf.
