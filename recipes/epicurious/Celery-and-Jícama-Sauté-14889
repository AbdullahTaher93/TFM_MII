Peel strings from celery with a vegetable peeler, then cut celery on a long diagonal into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Peel jicama with a sharp knife and cut into 2- by 1/4-inch matchsticks. Heat oil in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté garlic, turning, until golden on all sides, about 2 minutes. Discard garlic. Add celery to oil and sauté, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add jicama and sauté, stirring, until slightly translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining ingredients and remove from heat.
