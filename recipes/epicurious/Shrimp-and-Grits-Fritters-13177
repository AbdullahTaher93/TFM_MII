Whisk together sour cream, lemon juice, and 1/4 tsp. salt; set aside for serving. Whisk flour, baking powder, Old Bay seasoning, and 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Whisk egg and buttermilk in a medium bowl, then add to dry ingredients and stir to combine. Stir in scallions, jalape√±o, shrimp, corn, and cheese. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium. Working in batches and adding more oil in between, drop 1/4-cupfuls corn mixture into skillet, flattening slightly, and cook until golden and crisp, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fritters to paper towels to drain; season with salt and serve immediately with sour cream sauce and lemon wedges alongside.
