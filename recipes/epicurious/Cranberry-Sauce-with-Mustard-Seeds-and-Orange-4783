In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the shallot and ginger and cook, stirring, until the shallots are tender and lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the mustard seeds and cinnamon and cook, stirring frequently, until the seeds are toasted and start to pop, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cranberries, sugar, orange zest, and 3/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the cranberries start to burst, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool completely. Discard cinnamon stick and orange peel before serving.
