Set aside 2 tablespoons chickpeas for serving. Process tahini, lemon juice, red pepper paste, pomegranate molasses (if using), and remaining chickpeas in a food processor, adding water as needed, until hummus is very smooth; season with salt. Serve hummus drizzled with oil and topped with Aleppo pepper and reserved chickpeas, with pita bread alongside.
