Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan over high heat for 1–2 minutes or until the butter starts to foam. Sprinkle the steak with salt and pepper. Add the thyme, garlic and steak to the pan and cook for 4–5 minutes on each side, spooning the butter over the steak, for medium-rare or until cooked to your liking. Drizzle the steak with the butter to serve.
