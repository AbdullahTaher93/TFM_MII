Boil 4 scrubbed lemons until softened, 10-12 minutes. Transfer lemons to a bowl of ice water. Reserve cooking liquid. Using a paring knife, deeply score lengthwise 4 times, leaving lemons intact. Whisk 2/3 cup sugar, 7 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 teaspoon crushed coriander seeds, 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric, 1 clove, and 3 cups hot cooking liquid in a bowl. Transfer lemons to a 1-quart heatproof jar and add brine. Cover and chill at least 2 weeks.
