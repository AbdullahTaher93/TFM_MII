Place all the ingredients in a blender and puree. Refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight (this helps the bubbles to settle and the crepes not to tear). Grease a saute pan or crepe pan with butter. Pour in 2 tbsp of batter and swirl to cover the pan. Cook for 1 minutes, flip and continue to cook another 30 seconds or until just starting to become golden. Remove to a plate and continue to make remaining crepes. Spread with apple butter, almond butter, mashed bananas, fruit preserves or any other favorite filling. Roll into a cigar shape. Serve
