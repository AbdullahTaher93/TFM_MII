Preheat oven to 320°F (160°C ). Lightly grease a 22cm springform cake tin and line the base with non-stick baking paper. Place the almonds in a food processor and process until finely chopped. Add the dates, butter, flour, vanilla and cinnamon and process until a soft dough forms. Press into the base of the prepared tin and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and crisp. Place the strawberries, lemon juice and water in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, for 6 minutes or until soft. Stir in the rice malt syrup and vanilla beans, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 12 minutes or until thickened. Discard the vanilla beans. Spread the jam over the base and sprinkle with the flaked almonds. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly golden. Allow to cool in the tin. Slice to serve.
