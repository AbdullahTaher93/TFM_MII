Wrap the saffron threads in aluminum foil and toast lightly in a hot frying pan for a few seconds, being careful not to let them burn. Cool. Put the peeled garlic and the parsley leaves into a small bowl. Add the toasted saffron threads. Next, add the olive oil. Process with a hand-held blender to make a coarse paste. Add the toasted hazelnuts and continue to make an even, fine mixture.
