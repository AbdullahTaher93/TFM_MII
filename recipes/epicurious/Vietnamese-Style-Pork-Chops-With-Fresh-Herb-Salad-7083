Blend shallot, garlic, brown sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, oil, and pepper in a blender. Transfer marinade to a large resealable plastic bag. Add pork chop and turn to coat. Seal bag, pressing out air; chill at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. (Alternatively, heat a grill pan over medium-high.) Remove pork chops from marinade, letting excess drip back into bag; season both sides with salt. Grill pork chops, turning once, until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side. Meanwhile, toss plums, scallions, chile, herbs, bean sprouts, and vinegar in a large bowl. Season with salt; toss again. Serve pork with salad and lime wedges.
