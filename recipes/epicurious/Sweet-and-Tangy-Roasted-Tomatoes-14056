1. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, making sure to cover the inside of the rim. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 425°F/220°C. 2. Poke the tomatoes with a paring knife to allow steam out during cooking. Place them in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the oil, vinegar, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and Aleppo pepper and rub over the tomatoes with your fingertips, making sure the ingredients are well combined. 3. Spread the tomatoes in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast until the tomatoes are broken down and caramelized, 45 to 60 minutes, stirring twice during cooking. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool to room temperature before using.
