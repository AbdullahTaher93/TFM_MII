Place the chicken, carrot, celery, onion, leek, bay leaves, garlic, peppercorns and water in a large pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover with a lid and simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes. Strain the soup, reserving the stock and the whole chicken. Return the stock to a clean pot over high heat, add the spelt and bring to a boil. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes or until tender. Shred the chicken, discarding the skin and bones. Add the extra celery, broccolini, salt and pepper to the pot and cook for 4 minutes. Add the green beans and shredded chicken and cook for 2 minutes or until the beans are tender. Remove from the heat and stir in the kale leaves and lemon zest. Divide the soup among bowls, top with the lemon balm and sprinkle with cracked black pepper to serve.
