Put oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they release their water and the pan begins to dry out again, 10-15 minutes. Add leeks and cook, stirring, until they soften a bit, 2-3 minutes. Add tarragon and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
