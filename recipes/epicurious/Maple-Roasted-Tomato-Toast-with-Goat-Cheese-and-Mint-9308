Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss tomatoes, syrup, oil, and 2 Tbsp. mint on a rimmed baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Roast tomatoes until caramelized and tender, 20–25 minutes. Pour off roasting liquid into a small bowl. Drizzle each toast with roasting liquid, then spread with goat cheese and top with roasted tomatoes and mint leaves.
