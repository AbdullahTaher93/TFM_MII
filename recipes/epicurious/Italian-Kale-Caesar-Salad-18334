Preheat oven to 400°F. Pulse egg yolk, garlic, anchovies, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, oregano, colatura (if using), and cayenne in a food processor or blender until smooth. Combine canola oil and 1/2 cup olive oil in a measuring cup with spout. With the motor running, add blended oil in a very thin stream; purée until a creamy emulsion forms. Add cheese and pulse to combine. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Toss bread with remaining 2 Tbsp. olive oil and spread on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, tossing once or twice, until crisp and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely. Combine kale and croutons in a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup dressing and toss to combine. Dressing can be made up to 5 days ahead. Refrigerate in an airtight container.
