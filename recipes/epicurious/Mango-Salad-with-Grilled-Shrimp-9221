Whisk together brown sugar and lime juice in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved, then whisk in red chile, shallot, cilantro, and mint. Add mangoes, tossing gently. Beginning at thick end, insert a skewer lengthwise through each shrimp to straighten. Transfer to a tray. Whisk together oil, jalape√±o, cumin, and salt, then brush on skewered shrimp until well coated. Grill shrimp, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Toss mango salad again and divide among 4 plates. Arrange 4 shrimp on top of each serving.
