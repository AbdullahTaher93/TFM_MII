Toss green beans, tomatoes, olives, garlic, wine, oil, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper in baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap, poke a small hole in the center, and microwave on high 3 minutes. Remove from microwave, uncover, and stir. Season fish on both sides with remaining 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper, then arrange over green bean mixture in baking dish. Top each fillet with 2 thyme sprigs. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high 2 1/2 minutes. Check if fish is opaque; if not, continue microwaving at 20-second intervals. Remove from microwave and let sit, covered, 2 minutes.
