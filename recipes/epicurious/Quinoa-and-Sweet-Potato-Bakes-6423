Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly grease 6 [3/4-cup–capacity (180ml)] Texas muffin tins, line with non-stick baking paper and set aside. Place the sweet potato, oil, and salt on a baking tray lined with baking paper and toss to combine. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool slightly and transfer to a large bowl. Add the quinoa, linseeds, onion, ricotta, Parmesan, thyme, eggs and pepper and mix until just combined. Spoon into the prepared tins and top with the goat’s cheese and extra thyme. Sprinkle with the extra quinoa, drizzle with extra oil and bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden. Serve warm.
