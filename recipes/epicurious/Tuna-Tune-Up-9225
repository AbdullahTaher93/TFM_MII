Preheat oven to 400°F/200°C or gas mark 6. Remove dark green stalks from the fennel and reserve for another use (see tip). Cut the fennel in half lengthwise, then into 1⁄3-inch/8-millimeter slices crosswise. Place on a baking sheet and toss with the olive oil and a little salt and pepper. Roast until softened and lightly browned in some areas, about 30 minutes. To make hard-boiled eggs, place the eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and then turn off the heat and let sit for 12 minutes. Rinse in cool water. When cool enough to handle, peel the eggs and rinse off any bits of shell. Cut each egg into 8 wedges. Reserve. To assemble the sandwiches, place the bottom of the baguettes on a work surface. Spread each with 1 teaspoon/5 grams tapenade. Top with 1/2 cup/10 grams mesclun, 1 slice tomato, 1 1/2 ounces/42 grams fennel, 1 1/2 ounces/ 42 grams tuna and 4 wedges of egg. Top with other half of baguette.
