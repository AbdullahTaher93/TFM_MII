Bring milk, salt, and 2 1/2 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Gradually whisk in grits until smooth. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook, whisking occasionally, until creamy but still with some bite, 20â€“25 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and cheese; season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with chives.
