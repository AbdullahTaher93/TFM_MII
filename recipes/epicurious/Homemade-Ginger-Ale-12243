In a saucepan bring sugar, water, and ginger to a boil. Stirring occasionally cook until sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool completely. (Syrup may be made 1 week ahead and chilled, covered.) Spoon 2 tablespoons of ginger syrup into a tall glass filled with ice. Top off with seltzer and stir to combine.
