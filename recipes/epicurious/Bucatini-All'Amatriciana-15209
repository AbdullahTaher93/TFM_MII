Cook guanciale in a large deep skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp and fat is fully rendered, about 10 minutes. Stir in crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and simmer until thickened and tomatoes have broken down, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of salted water until just al dente. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Add pasta to skillet along with reserved cooking liquid and cook over high heat, stirring and tossing, until pasta is thickly coated with sauce, about 3 minutes. Stir in oil and cheese and serve. The sauce can be cooked up to 3 days ahead. Refrigerate in an airtight container.
