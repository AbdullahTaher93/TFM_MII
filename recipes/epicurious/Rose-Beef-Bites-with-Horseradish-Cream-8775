1 Preheat the oven to 350°F. Slice the baguette into 18 thin circles. Brush both sides of each slice with melted butter. Place the baguette circles on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven for about 7-10 minutes, turning halfway through, until brown, then let cool. 2 To make the horseradish cream, combine the crème fraîche or sour cream with the horseradish and season to taste. When the baguette circles have cooled, place a spoonful of horseradish cream on top of each one. 3 Cut each slice of beef in half lengthwise, then roll it up to form a pretty rose spiral. Place a roll of beef on top of each baguette circle, then garnish with watercress leaves.
