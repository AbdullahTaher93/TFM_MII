Place the sugar and 1 cup (250 ml) water in a saucepan and slowly bring to a boil, allowing the sugar to dissolve. Let simmer gently for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. Place the blueberries in a food processor and add the blue cura√ßao and one-third of the sugar syrup (about 5 tablespoons). Blitz until completely smooth, then pour into the bottom of four popsicle molds and place in the freezer for 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, clean the food processor bowl and add the mango with the tequila and another one-third of the syrup. Blitz until completely smooth. When the blueberry base is frozen solid, remove the molds from the freezer and pour over the mango mixture. Return the molds to the freezer and freeze for another 1 1/2 hours. Finally, blitz together the strawberries, rum, and remaining syrup. Pour the strawberry mixture over the mango layer once it has frozen solid. Freeze for another 1 1/2 hours, or until completely solid.
