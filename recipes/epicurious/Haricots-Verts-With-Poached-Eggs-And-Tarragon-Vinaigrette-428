Transfer with a slotted spoon to an ice bath, then drain and pat dry. Toss with 1/2 cup vinaigrette. Bring 1 1/2 inches water and white vinegar to a boil in a 12-inch skillet. Break 1 egg into a cup and slide into water. Repeat with remaining eggs, spacing them evenly. Poach at a bare simmer until whites are firm but yolks are still runny, 2-4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Season with salt and pepper. Serve haricots verts sprinkled with pistachios and topped with eggs. Drizzle with some of remaining vinaigrette.
