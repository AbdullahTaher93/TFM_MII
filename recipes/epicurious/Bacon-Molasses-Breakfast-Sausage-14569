Stir together the pork, bacon, molasses, smoked paprika, brown sugar, salt, sage, and black pepper until well combined. Heat up a skillet over medium heat and cook a small spoonful of the sausage for a couple of minutes on each side. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary. Once you're satisfied with the flavor balance, refrigerate the mixture for an hour for the flavors to come together. To cook the sausage, form it into 2-inch-wide, 1/4-inch-thick patties and fry over medium-high heat until both sides are brown and crisp, 5 minutes per side. The sausage will keep in the refrigerator for a week uncooked, and it can also be frozen uncooked for 3 months.
