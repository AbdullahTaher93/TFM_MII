Toast fennel seeds in a dry small skillet over medium-low, tossing, until fragrant, about 2 minutes; transfer to a small bowl. Toss cabbage and 2 Tbsp. salt in a large bowl. Massage vigorously until cabbage begins to release water and soften, about 2 minutes. Rinse in cold water until no longer too salty; squeeze out excess liquid and pat dry. Toss in a large bowl with vinegar, oil, sugar, and fennel seeds. Season with pepper. Cabbage can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill.
