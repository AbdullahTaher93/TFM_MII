In a small skillet, warm 6 tablespoons olive oil, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried garlic, dried onion, and coarse salt over medium-low heat until the spices just start to sizzle and turn very light brown, about 2 minutes. Quickly pour into a heat-safe bowl and allow to cool completely. Season the lamb chops with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside. In a large skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and sauté until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add carrots and sauté until softened and starting to brown, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, 2 teaspoons harissa, cumin, and paprika and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute more. Add broth and scrape up brown bits from bottom of pan. Stir in chickpeas, tomatoes, remaining 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more harissa if desired. In a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat, heat vegetable oil. Sear chops, working in batches if necessary, 3 minutes per side, until the internal temperature reaches 125°F for medium rare. Mix yogurt with lemon juice. Gently fold in 1 tablespoon everything-bagel-spiced olive oil. To serve, spoon the chickpea mixture onto the plate. Top each chop with a dollop of yogurt. Finish with an additional drizzle of the spiced oil. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
