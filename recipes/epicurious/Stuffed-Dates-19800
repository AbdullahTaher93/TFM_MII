In a mixing bowl, add the ground almonds, powdered sugar, and orange flower water. Add 1 Tbsp water and work into a paste. The dough should be slightly moist; add a few more drops of water (or orange flower water) if needed. If using food coloring, divide the paste into even parts, add 5 or 6 drops of a single color to each, and work in. Wipe the dates with a damp cloth. Cut a lengthwise incision across the top of each date and carefully remove the pit. Take 1 tsp or so of the almond paste, roll it between your palms into a spherical shape, and tuck inside the date. It should bulge out of the opening. Repeat with the remaining paste and dates. Garnish each date with a walnut pressed slightly edgewise into the almond paste before serving.
