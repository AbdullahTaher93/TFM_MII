Coat a 3- to 4 1/2-quart slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the low-fat and evaporated milks, egg, salt, and pepper in the cooker and whisk until smooth. Add the cheese and macaroni; gently stir with a rubber spatula to coat evenly with the milk and cheese mixture. Sprinkle the Parmesan on the top. Cover and cook on low until the custard is set in the center and the pasta is tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Do not cook more than 4 hours, as the sides will dry out and burn. Macaroni and Italian Cheese: For the cheddar, substitute a combination of 1 cup of shredded fontina (4 ounces) and 1/2 cup of diced or shredded mozzarella (2 ounces). Macaroni and Swiss Cheese: Substitute an equal amount of shredded Gruy√®re or Emmenthaler cheese for the cheddar. Macaroni and Blue Cheese: Add 1/2 cup of crumbled Gorgonzola (2 ounces), Stilton, Roquefort, or American blue cheese to the cheddar and macaroni.
