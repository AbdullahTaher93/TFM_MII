Bring cream, 1 cup sugar, and a pinch of kosher salt to a gentle simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Cook 3 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in lemon juice. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a medium bowl and press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto surface (this will help prevent a skin from forming). Chill lemon cream until it has set up to a pudding-like consistency, at least 12 hours. Preheat oven to 325°F. Combine gluten-free flour, butter, brown sugar, basil, vanilla, and a pinch of kosher salt in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, work mixture until it comes together in small clumps. Scatter crumble on a large parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and slightly firm, 30–35 minutes. Let cool and break into smaller pieces. Mix in granola. Increase oven temperature to 425°F. Toss strawberries, smoked salt, and remaining 1/4 cup sugar on a clean rimmed baking sheet to combine. Roast strawberries, tossing once, until they are juicy but still hold their shape, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. Just before serving, assemble trifles by spooning alternating layers of lemon cream, roasted strawberries, and granola crumble into 8–12-oz. glasses or jars, dividing evenly. Top off with some mint and basil leaves. Lemon cream can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
