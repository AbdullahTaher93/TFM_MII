Coat 8x8" baking pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray; line with parchment, leaving overhang on all sides. Process 2 cups pitted Medjool dates, 3/4 cup raw cacao powder, 3/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut, 1/4 cup cacao nibs, 2 tablespoons agave syrup, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 2 tablespoons water in a food processor until smooth (you may need to stop and scrape down sides a few times). Press mixture firmly into prepared pan. Scatter 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut over top; press to adhere. Cut into bars.
