	abstract = {The recommendation of food items is important for many reasons. Attaining cooking inspiration via digital sources is becoming evermore popular; as are systems, which recommend other types of food, such as meals in restaurants or products in supermarkets. Researchers have been studying these kinds of systems for many years, suggesting not only that can they be a means to help people find food they might want to eat, but also help them nourish themselves more healthily. This paper provides a summary of the state-of-the-art of so-called food recommender systems, highlighting both seminal and most recent approaches to the problem, as well as important specializations, such as food recommendation systems for groups of users or systems which promote healthy eating. We moreover discuss the diverse challenges involved in designing recsys for food, summarise the lessons learned from past research and outline what we believe to be important future directions and open questions for the field. In providing these contributions we hope to provide a useful resource for researchers and practitioners alike.},

First the system can identify the degree of regional cuisine style mixture of any selected recipe and visualize such regional cuisine style mixtures using barycentric Newton diagrams. Second, the system can suggest ingredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such that a recipe becomes more authentic for any selected regional cuisine style. Drawing on a large number of recipes from Yummly, an example shows how the proposed system can transform a traditional Japanese recipe, Sukiyaki, into French style.},

Unfortunately, online systems can fail to engage users in the long term, affecting their ability to sustain positive lifestyle change. In this work we present the initial analysis of a large scale application study of personalized technologies for lifestyle change. We evaluate the stickiness of an eHealth portal which provides individuals with three personalized tools – meal planner, social network feeds, and social comparison – to make change a reality in their lives. More than 5000 Australians took part in a 12 week study and provided solid empirical evidence for how the inclusion of personalized tools can assist and motivate users. Initial results show that the personalized tools boost user interaction with the portal, simplify information access, and assist in motivating users.",

We wish to build systems which can recommend nutritious meal plans to users, however a crucial pre-requisite is to be able to recommend recipes that people will like. In this work we investigate key factors contributing to how recipes are rated by analysing the results of a longitudinal study (n=124) in order to understand how best to approach the recommendation problem. We identify a number of important contextual factors which can influence the choice of rating. Based on this analysis, we construct several recipe recommendation models that are able to leverage understanding of user's likes and dislikes in terms of ingredients and combinations of ingredients and in terms of nutritional content. Via experiment over our dataset we are able to show that these models can significantly outperform a number of competitive baselines.",

For all tasks, our language-based models significantly outperform the majority-class baselines. Performance is further improved with more complex natural language processing, such as topic modeling. We analyze which textual features have most predictive power for these datasets, providing insight into the connections between the language of food, geographic locale, and community characteristics. Lastly, we design and implement an online system for real-time query and visualization of the dataset. Visualization tools, such as geo-referenced heatmaps, semantics-preserving wordclouds and temporal histograms, allow us to discover more complex, global patterns mirrored in the language of food.},

The collection of daily nutritional data involves keeping detailed diaries or periodic surveys and is limited in scope and reach. Alternatively, social media is infamous for allowing its users to update the world on the minutiae of their daily lives, including their eating habits. In this work we examine the potential of Twitter to provide insight into US-wide dietary choices by linking the tweeted dining experiences of 210K users to their interests, demographics, and social networks. We validate our approach by relating the caloric values of the foods mentioned in the tweets to the state-wide obesity rates, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.77 across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia. We then build a model to predict county-wide obesity and diabetes statistics based on a combination of demographic variables and food names mentioned on Twitter. Our results show significant improvement over previous CHI research (Culotta'14). We further link this data to societal and economic factors, such as education and income, illustrating that, for example, areas with higher education levels tweet about food that is significantly less caloric. Finally, we address the somewhat controversial issue of the social nature of obesity (first raised by Christakis {\&} Fowler in 2007) by inducing two social networks using mentions and reciprocal following relationships.},

However, there is little understanding of these palate varieties. In this paper, we present a large-scale study of recipes published on the web and their content, aiming to understand cuisines and culinary habits around the world. Using a database of more than 157K recipes from over 200 different cuisines, we analyze ingredients, flavors, and nutritional values which distinguish dishes from different regions, and use this knowledge to assess the predictability of recipes from different cuisines. We then use country health statistics to understand the relation between these factors and health indicators of different nations, such as obesity, diabetes, migration, and health expenditure. Our results confirm the strong effects of geographical and cultural similarities on recipes, health indicators, and culinary preferences across the globe.},

@article{Min2018,
	abstract = {Cuisine is a style of cooking and usually associated with a specific geographic region. Recipes from different cuisines shared on the web are an indicator of culinary cultures in different countries. Therefore, analysis of these recipes can lead to deep understanding of food from the cultural perspective. In this paper, we perform the first cross-region recipe analysis by jointly using the recipe ingredients, food images and attributes such as the cuisine and course (e.g., main dish and dessert). For that solution, we propose a Multi-modal Multi-attribute Culinary Culture Analysis (M2C2A) framework to discover the themes of ingredient bases and visualize them to enable various applications. We firstly propose a probabilistic theme model to discover cuisine-course-specific themes. The manifold ranking method is then utilized to incorporate deep visual features to retrieve food images for theme visualization. At last, we applied the theme modeling and visualization method for three applications: (1) multi-modal cuisine summarization with both recipe ingredients and images, (2) cuisine-course pattern analysis including theme-specific cuisine distribution and cuisine-specific course distribution of themes, and (3) cuisine recommendation for both cuisine-oriented and ingredient-oriented queries. Through the three applications, we can analyze the culinary cultures at both macro and micro levels. We conduct the experiment on a recipe database Yummly- 66K with 66,615 recipes from 10 cuisines in Yummly. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results have validated the effectiveness of theme modeling and visualization, and demonstrated the advantage of the framework in utilizing the multi-modal and multi-attribute information to analyze and interpret the culinary cultures from different regions.},

ABSTRACT={Collecting accurate and detailed dietary intake data is costly at a national level. Accordingly, limited dietary assessment tools such as Short Food Questionnaires (SFQs) are increasingly used in large surveys. This paper describes a novel method linking matched datasets to improve the quality of dietary data collected. Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) is a nationally representative longitudinal study of infants in the Republic of Ireland which used a SFQ (with no portion sizes) to assess the intake of “healthy” and “unhealthy” food and drink by 3 years old preschool children. The National Preschool Nutrition Survey (NPNS) provides the most accurate estimates available for dietary intake of young children in Ireland using a detailed 4 days weighed food diary. A mapping algorithm was applied using food name, cooking method, and food description to fill all GUI food groups with information from the NPNS food datafile which included the target variables, frequency, and amount. The augmented data were analyzed to examine all food groups described in NPNS and GUI and what proportion of foods were covered, non-covered, or partially-covered by GUI food groups, as a percentage of the total number of consumptions. The term non-covered indicated a specific food consumption that could not be mapped using a GUI food group. “High sugar” food items that were non-covered included ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, fruit juice, sugars, syrups, preserves and sweeteners, and ice-cream. The average proportion of consumption frequency and amount of foods not covered by GUI was 44 and 34\%, respectively. Through mapping food codes in this manner, it was possible, using density plots, to visualize the relative performance of the brief dietary instrument (SFQ) compared to the more detailed food diary (FD). The SFQ did not capture a substantial portion of habitual foods consumed by 3-year olds in Ireland. Researchers interested in focussing on specific foods, could use this approach to assess the proportion of foods covered, non-covered, or partially-covered by reference to the mapped food database. These results can be used to improve SFQs for future studies and improve the capacity to identify diet-disease relationships.}
